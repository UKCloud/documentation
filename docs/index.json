    "keywords": "Bring Your Own Firewall: Known working and non-working firewalls Introduction The UKCloud Bring Your Own Firewall service option enables you to install your own virtual firewall within your compute environment instead of using the vCNS device we provide as standard. This enables you to use technology with which you are already familiar and which offers the exact functionality that meets your requirements. While we provide you with a vDC that enables you to use whichever firewall technology you want and do not impose any specific restrictions, this guide aims to provide information about technology that is known to work or not work on our platform. By requesting the Bring Your Own Firewall option, you accept that you are entirely responsible for sourcing, licensing, installing, configuring and maintaining your firewall. UKCloud will not be able to offer any support for issues caused by the use of a non-standard firewall. Known working firewalls The following firewall technology has been successfully deployed and configured on the UKCloud platform. pfSense firewalls pfSense v2.2.4 i386 pfSense v2.3.1 i386 pfSense v2.3.1 amd64 Palo Alto firewalls Palo Alto VM300 running PanOS 7.01 Cisco Cloud Services Router 1000v (Cisco CSR1000v) While CSR1000v version 3.16 is supported in both vSphere and vCloud Director deployments, there is a compatibility issue with OVF templates built on legacy hardware configurations (hardware version 7). To ensure that your CSR1000v router operates correctly, ensure that your OVF template is built on the most recent hardware version (9 or above). For more information see: https://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=2107517 Known non-working firewalls The following firewall technology is known to not work with the UKCloud platform. Cisco ASAv This product is not supported in vCloud Director and therefore will not work on the UKCloud platform.

    "keywords": "Access to virtual machines on the UKCloud platform What access does UKCloud have to our running virtual machines and the memory they are using? Our default policy is that no UKCloud personnel have access to any of our customer’s environments. We would need a specific, customer approved change ticket in order to gain access to a customers’ environment if we are to assist them with resolving any issues. UKCloud provides compute in line with the NIST defined IaaS cloud delivery model, which means that we manage the components up to and including the hypervisor, but we do not manage the virtual machine (VM) or anything within it (for example, the operating system or local disks). Each customer has complete autonomy in provisioning their VMs and therefore has exclusive control over the security credentials they use for each VM. As UKCloud does not have access to these security credentials, our personnel have no ability to authenticate and gain access to customer VMs. UKCloud personnel do have access to the vSphere hypervisors, physical servers and storage in which customer VMs run, so that they can effectively manage and maintain the cloud platform. This does not give them access to individual VMs, but rather the underlying resource pool. What controls do you have in place to prevent access to our data, either on disk or in memory? UKCloud was one of the first cloud service providers to achieve NCSC Pan Government Accreditation to host government data classified up to and including UK RESTRICTED (IL3 under the Government Protective Marking Scheme) and is one of the few cloud service providers who maintain PSN Accreditation, as well as the approval of the Health and Social Care Information Commission (HSCIC) to provide access to N3/HSCN and Personally Identifiable Data. This heritage means that we have mature and well developed security controls throughout our organisation. This encompasses robust and multi-tiered physical, logical and technical security systems and controls. Given the low-level access that UKCloud personnel have to the cloud platform, we have implemented a variety of interconnected controls which include people, process and technology. We have a comprehensive Role Based Access Control (RBAC) system, which ensures that only authorised personnel can access appropriate elements of the cloud platform as required to undertake the authorised tasks of their role In addition, UKCloud is subject to regular ITSC CHECK Tests which provide a comprehensive and in-depth independent assessment of technical and security configurations, and check alignment of the assurance of UKCloud to Service Definitions, published RMADS and appropriate UK Government and industry standards. UKCloud maintains a protective monitoring service aligned with NCSC Good Practice Guidance GPG13 and the prescribed protective monitoring controls PMC1-12. This ensures that UKCloud has a comprehensive and detailed audit log, tracking which personnel have accessed and performed tasks on the cloud platform. All UKCloud personnel are appropriately vetted and security cleared so that customers can be assured that engineers with access to the underlying infrastructure are operating at the highest levels of trust (for example, through vetting and clearance frameworks including like BPSS, SC, DV and NPPV). UKCloud benefits from a full-time internal compliance function, which regularly audits company functions and processes to assess whether they are being correctly followed (for example by maintaining clear evidence where customers request and permit UKCloud to access their VMs). Any non-conformance is documented, reported to Board Level, and followed up to ensure that effective remedial actions are implemented. Finally, to complement the high levels of security inherent within the UKCloud platform, UKCloud recommends that customers use appropriate controls within the VM or application, such as data at rest encryption (for example, Bitlocker or Becrypt), session encryption (for example, HTTPS or VPN), and the implementation of appropriate protective monitoring. UKCloud has produced extensive security collateral to explain how we provide an assured cloud platform, including our Government Security Classification Policy whitepaper, relevant evidence packs and RMADS. If you would like to discuss this further, we can arrange for an Account Director, a Cloud Architect or a member of the Compliance Team to contact you.

    "title": "How to install and configure OpenVPN | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to install and configure OpenVPN Overview Secure remote access to the cloud is essential to cloud adoption and use. UKCloud for VMware comes with a dedicated edge gateway, providing a simple and easy-to-use solution that supports IPsec site-to-site virtual private networks (VPNs) and a limited number of remote access client VPNs designed for occasional use. If you require a more flexible or scalable solution, you can deploy your own choice of virtual appliances (either open-source solutions, such as OpenVPN or commercial solutions from a supplier, such as Cisco, F5 or Palo Alto), instead of using the limited VPN service provided with the default edge gateway. This article details the steps required to obtain, deploy and configure an OpenVPN virtual appliance to obtain remote access to your virtual data centres (VDCs) running on the UKCloud platform. Note OpenVPN is a licensed product. Without a licence key, you are limited to only two concurrent VPN connections. If you require additional concurrent connections, you'll need to obtain and install a licence key. Preparing your virtual data centre To secure your environment, we recommend that you deploy the OpenVPN appliance into a new, routed VDC network. Ideally, no other virtual machines (VMs) should connect to this network. This enables you to tightly control access from VPN clients to the VMs in your environment using firewall rules on the edge gateway. However, if you're approaching the network interface limit of your edge gateway, it's possible to deploy the OpenVPN appliance into an existing network. Create a new VDC network Using the HTML5 tenant portal in vCloud Director 9.1 In vCloud Director, go to the VDC and in the Network section, click Add . Fill in the required fields and select the edge to route through. Provide a gateway, subnet mask and DNS. Create a static pool in the format of: 192.168.1.2-192.168.1.100 and click Add . When you're done, click Save . Using the Flex-based UI in vCloud Director 8.20 To create a new VDC network: In vCloud Director, select the Administration tab. Right-click your VDC and select Open , then select the Org VDC Networks tab. Click the green plus icon. On the Select Network Type page of the New Organization VDC Network dialog box, select Create a routed network . Provide the network addressing information requested in the rest of the dialog box and then click Finish . More information! How to create a routed VDC network Configuring the edge gateway After you've created the network, you'll need to configure the edge gateway to control access to the VMs in your environment. To configure the edge gateway: In vCloud Director, select the Administration tab. Right-click your VDC and select Open , then select the Edge Gateways tab Right-click your gateway and select Edge Gateway Services . To control access to your VMs, you should create the following: A source NAT rule to allow the OpenVPN appliance outbound access to the internet. A destination NAT rule to allow inbound access from the internet to the OpenVPN appliance. A firewall rule to allow inbound access from the internet on port 443 . One or more firewall rules to allow users connected to the OpenVPN appliance to access VMs on other networks for administration purposes. Note All VPN users will be NATed to the IP address of the OpenVPN appliance. One or more firewall rules to allow access from trusted environments to the OpenVPN appliance on the admin port (port 943 by default, but can be changed) More information! How to create firewall rules and How to create NAT rules Obtaining the latest OpenVPN appliance To ensure you're running the latest release of OpenVPN, we recommend that you download the latest version of the appliance directly from the OpenVPN website: Go to the following location to download the latest OVA file: https://swupdate.openvpn.org/appliances/AS2.ova In vCloud Director, select the Catalogs tab. In the left navigation panel, select My Organization's Catalogs . Open the catalog you'd like to add the appliance to, or create a new catalog. Click the Upload button and upload the OVA file to the catalog. Deploying the OpenVPN appliance Using the HTML5 tenant portal in vCloud Director 9.1 To deploy the OpenVPN appliance: In vCloud Director, go to your VDC and select vApps . Click Add vApp from OVF . Select the OVA that you downloaded then click Next . Review the details of the OVA to confirm that it's the right images then click Next . The appliance will be deployed as a single VM inside a vApp. Provide a name for the vApp then click Next . Provide a valid NetBIOS host name and your desired storage policy then click Next . Configure the network by selecting Switch to advanced networking workflow . Select the network adapter type, network and IP pool assignment ( Manual ) then click Next . Select the number of vCPUs, sockets and memory this appliance will have then click Next . Review the details then click Finish to deploy the vApp and appliance. When the vApp has deployed and is powered on, you'll need to reset (reboot) the VM before logging in for the first time to force the networking changes made during VMWare's guest customisations to take effect before you start configuring OpenVPN. Using the Flex-based UI in vCloud Director 8.20 To deploy the OpenVPN appliance: In vCloud Director, select the My Cloud tab. In the left navigation panel, select vApps . In the toolbar, click the Add vApp from OVF icon. In the Add vApp from OVF wizard, on the Select Source page, select Local file and browse to the OVA file that you downloaded, then click Next . The appliance will be deployed as a single VM inside the vApp. On the Review Details page, confirm the details of the OVA file and then click Next On the Select Name and Location page, enter a meaningful Name and Description for your vApp From the Virtual Datacenter list, select the VDC in which you want to create the vApp and then click Next . On the Configure Resources page, select your desired storage policy and then click Next . On the Configure Networking page, provide a name for the VM. Select the Switch to the advanced networking workflow check box. This enables you to select your desired network and change the IP assignment method. Typically, we recommend that you deploy the VPN appliance to its own network segment (as described in Preparing your virtual data centre , and use the Static IP Pool method of IP assignment. Continue through the wizard and click Finish . There are no further changes necessary unless you want to customise the vApp further to suit your environment. When the vApp has deployed and is powered on, you'll need to reset (reboot) the VM before logging in for the first time to force the networking changes made during VMWare's guest customisations to take effect before you start configuring OpenVPN. Performing initial configuration To perform initial configuration: In vCloud Director, right-click your OpenVPN VM and select Popout Console . Log in to the VM as the root user. Tip To obtain the root password, right-click the VM, select Properties , click the Guest OS Customization tab and make a note of the password. You'll be prompted to answer a series of questions: Licence agreement: --- Enter yes to accept. Will this be the primary Access Server node? --- Enter yes . Please specify the network interface and IP address to be used by the Admin Web UI -- If the guest customisations were applied correctly, this should default to eth0 , which should be configured with an IP address on the network you selected during deployment. Please specify the port number for the Admin Web UI --- Enter your desired port number, or accept the default of 943 . A separate port is not strictly needed for administration but is recommended. Please specify the TCP port number for the OpenVPN Daemon --- We recommend that you use the default of 443 where possible as the use of a non-standard port may cause problems when connecting from corporate networks. Should client traffic be routed by default through VPN? --- Entering yes will prevent your client device from accessing any other networks (for example, your corporate network) while the VPN is connected. For ease of use, we suggest you answer no to this question. Should client DNS traffic be routed by default through the VPN? --- If you answered yes to the previous question, all traffic will be routed through the VPN anyway, so your answer here will not matter. If you answered no to the previous question, you'll probably want to answer no to this question so that your DNS queries are answered by the usual servers. Use local authentication via internal DB? --- Enter yes unless you want to authenticate users from an existing directory service (Active Directory/LDAP). Should private subnets be accessible to clients by default? --- Answer yes to enable access to your cloud networks via the VPN. Do you wish to login to the Admin UI as \"openvpn\"? --- Answer yes to create a local user account named openvpn . If you answer no , you'll need to set up a different user name and password. Please specify your OpenVPN-AS license key --- If you've purchased a licence, enter the licence key, otherwise leave this blank. When you've completed the setup wizard, you'll need to create user accounts and passwords on the local operating system (unless you configured an LDAP directory). If you opted to use the default openvpn account, you'll need to configure its password: #passwd openvpn Press ^D to log off the console, but before you do so, there are some additional system configurations, detailed in the following sections, that you might want to perform while you're connected to the console. Check the DNS resolver configuration is in place During our tests, the DNS resolver configuration was not added by the VMware customisations. Enter the following command: # pico /etc/network/interfaces Use the arrow keys to scroll down. Below the line specifying the default gateway, add the following: dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 Press ^O to save the file, then ^X to exit the text editor. Restart the networking service for the change to take effect: # service networking restart Configure the keyboard The default configuration is for a US keyboard. To reconfigure for UK: Enter the following command: # dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration Step through the wizard. There's no need to restart anything when you're finished. Apply updates It's a good idea to apply the latest upgrades to the system. Enter the following command: # apt-get update && apt-get upgrade You'll be prompted to approve the installation of any updates. Install NTP Installing NTP is good practice anyway, but is required if you intend to use two-factor authentication via Google Authenticator. Enter the following command: # apt-get install ntp When the installation is complete, update the configuration file to point to UKCloud's NTP servers. # pico /etc/ntp.config Use the arrow keys to scroll down until you reach the lines beginning with server . Change the first two lines to reflect the UKCloud servers, and comment out the remaining two lines: Server 37.26.90.192 Server 37.26.94.232 Configuring administration options To configure administration options: Log on to the admin interface at: https://<ip_address>/admin To set the hostname, under Configuration , select Server Network Settings and then set the Hostname or IP Address to either a public IP address or a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that your client will be able to resolve. Save the settings on this page. Under Configuration , select VPN settings and, in the Routing section, add any additional subnets that your VPN users should have access to. These will usually be the IP subnets configured on all of your VDC networks. This is the minimum configuration required to be able to establish a VPN connection. If you want to create new user accounts, under User Management , select User Permissions . You can configure the password for each account by clicking the Show link in the More Settings column. Note Be sure to use complex passwords. Logging in and connecting You can download the VPN client software and connection profiles directly from the appliance by browsing to the following location and logging in with a valid user name and password: https://<ip_address>/ The downloaded client software and profile includes the client certificate that is required for authentication. When you've installed the client software or profile, you can initiate connections directly from the client. Securing the appliance We strongly recommend that you further secure the appliance by making the changes suggested in the following sections. Change all default passwords If you've not already done so, change the root password to something more secure. Log in to the OpenVPN VM console as the root user. Enter the following command: # passwd Lock down unused ports with iptables The OpenVPN configuration utility adds the required ALLOW entries to iptables automatically. To deny all other traffic, enter the following command: # iptables -A INPUT -j DROP Enable two-factor authentication via Google Authenticator You can enable two-factor authentication via the OpenVPN administration interface. Log on to the administration interface with the default account at: https://<ip_address>/admin Under Configuration , select Client Settings then click the checkbox to enable Google Authenticator support. Note Users will need to enter or scan the Google Authenticator secret by logging into the client portal ( http://<ip_address>/ ). When they've configured the secret, they should click the I scanned the QR code button to enforce two-factor authentication. Lock down the Admin Web UI and Client Web UI By default, both Admin and Client UIs are accessible over port 443 . This can pose a security risk if you've opened port 443 to the internet to allow users to connect from anywhere. Besides the obvious risk of unauthorised access to the administration interface, should an attacker gain access to the client interface, they'll be able to download the client certificates necessary to establish a VPN connection. You can limit the administration and client interfaces so that they are accessible only via the administration port number ( 943 by default). This enables you to restrict access to this port to a trusted IP address or network, while allowing VPN access on port 443 from anywhere. Your users will need to log in initially from the trusted network to install the client software, client certificate and configure Google Authenticator, before being able to establish VPN access. To lock down the administration and client interfaces: Log on to the administration interface with the default account at: https://<ip_address>/admin Under Configuration , select Server Network Settings . Under Service Forwarding in the VPN Server section, clear the check boxes for Admin Web Server and Client Web Server . Disable root SSH login If connecting via SSH, it's best practice to connect with a non-privileged account, then sudo to root if needed. This prevents an attacker from brute-forcing the root password. Enter the following command: # pico /etc/ssh/sshd\\_config Use the arrow keys to scroll down the file, and change the PermitRootLogin to no . Disable the default account During the initial setup, you created an user name and password to log in to the administration interface. This account, with the name openvpn , is configured to be always active, disregarding its status in the User Permissions area. In addition, if you configured two-factor authentication via Google Authenticator, this is not enforced for the default account. To disable the default account: Enter the following command: # pico /usr/local/openvpn_as/etc/as.conf Use the arrow keys to scroll down the file until you see entries starting with boot_pam_users . Comment out the entry for the user name you chose for the default account. Usually this is the boot_pam_users.0= entry. Restart the OpenVPN service for the change to take effect: # service restart openvpnas More help If you have any issues regarding the updating or support of Microsoft Server, contact the UKCloud support team by raising a Service Request.

    "keywords": "How to create a routed VDC network Overview An organisation virtual data centre network enables its virtual machines (VMs) to communicate with each other or to provide access to external networks. A single VDC can have multiple networks. There are two network flavours, isolated and routed: An isolated (internally connected) network is one that only VMs within the VDC can connect to. Creation of isolated networks is described in How to create an isolated VDC network . A routed network (externally connected) provides access to machines and networks outside the VDC via the edge gateway. You can have up to nine usable routed networks per VDC. This guide describes how to create a routed VDC network. Creating a routed VDC network To create a routed Org vDC network: In vCloud Director, click the Administration tab. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware Double-click the virtual data centre (VDC) that you want to work with, or right-click the VDC and select Open . Select the Org VDC Networks tab. Click the green + icon (or right-click an empty row and select Add Network ) Select the option to Create a routed network . Select the edge gateway that you want your network to connect to and then click Next . <!-- add info about what the Create as subinterface checkbox is for --> In the Configure Network page, create a network Gateway address and Network mask , and add a DNS if possible. The Static IP pool is similar to DHCP in the sense that it's a range of IP addresses to be consumed by the VMs connecting to the network. When a VM is configured it will have a static manual or a static IP pool address assigned to it. For static manual, enter the address manually. This must be a valid address for the pool. The VM will keep this address for as long as it exists. For static IP pool, enter a range of addresses. A free address from the IP pool will be allocated to the machine automatically. As an example, if you give the gateway address as 192.168.1.1 , you may then want to give a static IP pool of 192.168.1.10 to 192.168.1.100 . This will give you a pool of 91 IP addresses to assign to machines within your network. You can always increase this later if needed. Click Next . Give the network a Name and Description . If you want to make the network shareable with other VDCs, select the Share this network check box. Click Next to review your settings, and then click Finish . Next steps Now you've created your network to connect your VDC with the outside world, may want to configure your edge gateway to control what traffic is allowed into and out of your VDC.

    "keywords": "How to create a catalog Overview UKCloud provides a public catalogue for you to use that contains standard virtual machine (VM) sizes and operating systems. The public catalogue is a good place to start when you first deploy VMs into the UKCloud platform. However, you may want to create your own catalogues, containing specific applications or gold images, which you can then use to deploy VMs quickly. The first step is to create an empty catalogue. Creating a catalog To create an empty catalogue: In vCloud Director, select the Catalogs tab. Click the + button to add a new catalogue. Name the catalogue and give it a description if needed. There's also an option to add a Subscribed Catalog, a read-only copy of an externally published catalogue. If you want to do this, you'll need to know the URL, and the password if there is one. When you're done, click Next . You now have the option to select the storage type used to store the catalog. The default is Use any storage . Leave this selected if you don't need to store catalog items on specific storage. Alternatively, you can indicate where your catalog items should be stored if they need to be stored on a specific storage policy. When you're done, click Next . To make the catalog visible to others, add specific people or your entire organisation. Click the Add Members button to add everyone in the organisation or individual users. You can give individuals different access levels. When you've added all the people who can access the catalogue, click OK , then review each individual's access level and adjust it if needed. When you're done, click Next . You now have the choice to publish your catalog for the use of external organisations. To enable external publishing, select the checkbox and add a password if needed. If you don't want to share your catalog externally, just click Next . Review the settings and click Finish . Populating a catalog There are two ways to populate a catalog: By uploading an OVF package By creating a template from an existing vApp Uploading an OVF package To upload an OVF package and assign it to a catalogue: On the Catalogs tab, select the vApp Templates tab. Click the Upload button to open an OVF upload window. In the Upload OVF package as a vApp Template dialog box, select the source of the OVF: either a URL or a Local file . Give a destination for the OVF, and give the OVF a name. From the Catalog list, select the catalog you want to put the OVF in. When you're done, click Upload to import the OVF into the catalog. Depending on template size and network speed, the upload may take some time. Adding an existing vApp To create a catalog from an existing vApp: In vCloud Director, select the My Cloud tab. Right-click the vApp you want to add to the catalog and select Add to Catalog . You can add both running and stopped vApps to the catalog, although it's worth noting that creating a catalog image from a running vApp could affect performance. You can now choose the catalog you want to add the vApp to, give the vApp a new name, assign a storage lease, and define whether vApps deployed using this template are identical or customisable. You can also overwrite an existing catalog item. If the catalog you are adding the vApp to is published externally, you'll see a warning. When you're done, click OK .

    "title": "How to convert your edge to an advanced gateway | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Overview With the upgrade to vCloud Director 8.20, UKCloud for VMware now offers advanced gateways to provide access to new vCloud Director functionality. Some of this functionality is available now, with other features being added following integration testing to assess suitability on our platform (some features may incur additional charges). Advanced gateways in UKCloud for VMware provide: NSX Tenant Portal - The new Tenant Portal is a pure HTML5 user interface that you can use in conjunction with the legacy vCloud Director Web Console. This portal provides an initial set of controls to configure Advanced Gateway NSX Edges. New API NSX management - vCloud Director 8.20 introduces a new proxy API that enables vCloud API clients to make requests to the NSX API. Unlike the NSX API, which is designed to address NSX objects in a global scope, such as a vCenter database, the vCloud Director API for NSX is designed to address NSX objects within the scope of a vCloud Director tenant organisation. SSH edge access - If you enable SSH, you can perform your own packet captures and troubleshoot your edge gateway yourself, without having to contact UKCloud Support. Important After converting your edge gateway to an advanced gateway, the API endpoint for configuring edge services will change. Any tooling that you use to amend the edge service configuration, such as adding firewall rules, will no longer work in its current state. For more information about using the advanced gateway API, see the vCloud Director API for NSX Programming Guide . Important After converting your edge to an advanced gateway, you will not be able to enable or disable logging on firewall rules via the advanced gateway GUI. To enable or disable logging, you must either use the API or raise a service request detailing the firewall rules for which you want to enable or disable logging so that we can action it on your behalf. When you convert an edge, the advanced gateway inherits the firewall logging configuration from the original edge. Enabling or disabling logging for NAT or load balancer services is not affected and you can edit those settings from the advanced gateway GUI as normal. For more information about using the API to amend firewall rules, see the vCloud Director API for NSX Programming Guide . Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have access to the UKCloud Portal and vCloud Director. Prerequisites and known issues Before converting your edge gateway, review the prerequisites and known issues below: Edge gateway version --- To convert to an advanced gateway, your edge gateway must be at version 6.2. x . If necessary, redeploy your edge gateway to upgrade to the latest version; for more information, see How to upgrade your edge gateway . Disabled firewalls - On an advanced gateway, if you disable the firewall, this also stops the NAT service, as it is dependent on the firewall. As a result, traffic flow that relies on NAT, such as NAT rules and the load balancer is stopped. If you attempt to disable the firewall service, the vCloud Director Web Console will display a warning. This is due to the firewall service being used to track stateful connections. See the following VMware Knowledge Base article for more information: https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2093153 . If you convert an edge that already has the firewall disabled to an advanced gateway, the converted advanced gateway will have the firewall enabled, but with an Any, Any, Allow rule so that all traffic is allowed inbound or outbound. Internal/external keywords - Due to a bug in vCloud Director 8.20, when you create or amend firewall rules on your advanced gateway using the vCloud Director Web Console, you can no longer use the keywords internal or external when specifying the direction of the traffic. However, you can still use these keywords when using the API to create or amend rules. This Web Console bug is fixed in vCloud Director 9. x , which we'll be upgrading to in the coming months. For information about using the API to create or amend firewall rules, see the vCloud Director API for NSX Programming Guide . Converting your edge to an advanced gateway To access the latest vCloud Director networking features, you need to convert your edge to an advanced gateway. To convert your edge to an advanced gateway: Login to the UKCloud Portal. For more detailed steps, see the Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal . If necessary, switch to the appropriate account. Click My VMs . Select the compute service (vOrg) that the edge gateway belongs to. On the vCloud Director tab, enter your UKCloud Portal password and then click Confirm . In vCloud Director, select the Administration tab. Double-click the VDC that the edge gateway belongs to. Select the Edge Gateways tab. Right-click the edge gateway that you want to convert and select Convert to Advanced Gateway . Click Yes to start the conversion. Important After converting your edge gateway, check the firewall rules to make sure that the default rule for ingress traffic is set to Deny . Next steps To find out more about the features provided by advanced gateways, see the following articles: Upgrade to vCloud Director 8.20 Feedback If you have any comments on this document or any other aspect of your UKCloud experience, please send them to products@ukcloud.com ."

    "keywords": "How to build a virtual machine with UKCloud for VMware Overview This guide leads you through the three basic steps for using UKCloud for VMware to quickly build a simple virtual machine (VM) in vCloud Director, and connect it to the internet. For more information about how to use other vCloud Director functions to make the most of UKCloud for VMware and create more complex virtual data centres (VDCs), take a look at the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware . The three steps covered in this guide are: Create a network (to move requests around your VMs) Configure the edge gateway (in this guide we focus on the firewall and NAT configuration) Create a virtual machine If you follow these steps, you can have a VM up and running with a connection to the internet in about 20 to 25 minutes. Before you begin You should have received your UKCloud Portal login credentials from your Portal administrator. You should have created a VDC, compute service and edge gateway within your account. For more information, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware . The steps in this guide assume that you've converted your edge gateway to an advanced edge. For more information, see Converting your edge gateway We recommend that you use the Mozilla Firefox ESR browser as this is supported by the Web Console for the version of vCloud Director used by UKCloud for VMware. For more information, see Browser requirements for services on the UKCloud Platform . Create a network Before you can start building VMs in your VDC, you need to create the network that connects the VMs to each other and the outside world. First, you need to create a network that can connect to external networks outside your VDC (including the internet). This is called an external routed network . Log in to the UKCloud Portal. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal Select your account. In the Portal navigation panel, expand VMware Cloud and then select the compute service in which you want to create your VM. On the vCloud Director tab, enter your password and click Confirm . In vCloud Director, select the Administration tab. Double-click your VDC (or right-click the VDC and choose Open ). You're creating a network, so select the Org VDC Networks tab. To create a new network, click the green + icon (or right-click an empty row and choose Add Network ) to open the New Organization VDC Network dialog box. You want your VM to connect to the internet (rather than just other VMs in the same VDC), so in the Select Network Type page, choose the routed network option. When you connect a network to the outside world, it's important that you control exactly what can access your environment via that network. The UKCloud platform provides each VDC with an edge gateway to do this, so select the edge that you want your new network to use and then click Next (we'll work more with the edge gateway later on). In the Configure Network page, enter the details for the Gateway address , Network mask and Primary DNS . The example below uses 192.168.1.1 for the gateway, 255.255.255.0 for the mask and 8.8.8.8 for the DNS. A VM needs an IP address to identify it on the network. Use the Static IP pool field to identify the IP addresses that VMs connecting to this network can use. You can specify either individual IP addresses (static manual) or a range of IP addresses (static IP pool): For static manual, for each IP address that you want to use, enter the IP address and click Add . For example, if your default gateway is 192.168.1.1 , you can use 192.168.1.2 as a static manual IP address. Continue adding IP addresses as necessary. For static IP pool, enter the range of IP addresses to use and click Add . For example, if your default gateway is 192.168.1.1 , you can use the 192.168.1.10-192.168.1.100 range for your static IP pool, giving 91 usable internal IP addresses. Click Next . Give the network a Name and Description . You can make your network available to your other VDCs within the same region so that VMs can communicate with each other, regardless of which VDC they are in. For example, you may have a single repository server that provides updates for all the VMs in a region. For the purposes of this exercise, leave the Share this network option empty. Click Next to review your settings, and then click Finish . You can find more information about routed networks in How to create a routed VDC network . Configure the edge gateway The edge gateway is possibly the most complex part of the VDC because of its high level of functionality. The following exercise steps you through a quick way to configure the edge gateway to enable you to access the internet from a VM. If you are not already logged in to the UKCloud, log in now and select your account. In the Portal navigation panel, expand VMware Cloud and then select your compute service. On the vCloud Director tab, enter your password and click Confirm . Select the Administration tab. Double-click your VDC (or right-click the VDC and choose Open ). This time you're working with the edge gateway, so select the Edge Gateways tab. Right-click the edge gateway you want to work with and choose Edge Gateway Services . Note The steps that follow describe how to change the edge gateway settings for an advanced gateway. Each tab in the Edge Gateway page provides access to a different service provided by the edge gateway. The main tabs are: Firewall - As well as a physical firewall, you can control which networks and ports can communicate through the edge gateway. You'll set up some firewall rules later in this exercise. DHCP - The edge gateway can act as a DHCP server for VMs connected to Org networks connected to an edge. The DHCP tab shows DHCP information for any Org networks that have been configured with DHCP, and so acts as a centralised view. For more information, see How to create a DHCP pool . NAT - Network address translation, both in (DNAT) and out (SNAT) of the edge gateway. You'll set up some NAT rules later in this exercise. Routing - You can provide static routes from the edge gateway to other networks, for example networks in other VDCs in your compute service. For more information, see How to create a static route . Load Balancer - The edge gateway provides simple HTTP and HTTPS load balancing using round robin. For more information, see How to configure a load balancer . VPN - IPsec site‑to‑site VPN is available on the edge gateway. It can be configured within the vCloud user interface, but may require additional configuration through the API. For more information, see How to configure IPsec VPN . To access the internet from a VM, you'll need to create firewall rules to determine who can access your network and NAT rules to route traffic within your network. Let's start with the firewall rules. Select the Firewall tab and make sure the Enabled option is selected. Click the + button to add a new row to the firewall rules table. Edit the values in the row for the New Rule using the settings below: Name - HTTPS outbound Source - internal Destination - external Service - Click the + button and enter the following values in the Add Service dialog box Protocol - TCP Source Port - any Destination Port - 443 Click Keep when you're done. Action - Accept These settings allow traffic from the VMs ( Source = internal ) to reach destinations outside your VDC ( Destination = external ) on port 443 . You'll need to repeat these steps for ports 80 and 53 . You can also allow traffic to reach your VMs from outside your VDC by swapping the Source and Destination values. However, because this opens up your firewall to a lot of traffic, we recommend that you first complete this guide to get comfortable with general networking concepts, and then take a look at the information in How to create firewall rules where you can find out how to lock the firewall down. Click Save changes Now that you've set up the firewall rules, you can create NAT rules, so select the NAT tab. Click the + SNAT Rule button to create a source NAT (SNAT) rule to translate internal IP addresses into something that the external network can understand. In the Add SNAT Rule dialog box, from the Applied on list, choose the edge gateway to which you want to apply the SNAT rule. In the Original Source IP/Range field, enter the range of addresses you created when you created the network in the previous exercise. In the Translated Source IP/Range field, enter one or more of the external IP addresses provided to you by UKCloud. If you are not sure what your IP addresses are, see How to find your allocated external IP addresses . When you're done, click Keep and then Save changes . You can also add destination NAT (DNAT) rules to translate external IP addresses to route traffic to the appropriate internal addresses. However, because the firewall only provides outbound access to the internet, we don't need to add DNAT rules at the moment. You can find more information about setting up NAT rules in How to create NAT rules . Create a virtual machine Now that you've laid the groundwork, it's time to create your VM. The best way to do this is to create a virtual application (vApp). You can think of a vApp as a container for your VMs—it enables you to group related VMs together to manage them in one place. See How to create a vApp to find out more. If you are not already logged in to the UKCloud, log in now and select your account. In the Portal navigation panel, expand VMware Cloud and then select your compute service. On the vCloud Director tab, enter your password and click Confirm . In this exercise, you'll create the vApp from scratch, so on the Home tab, click the Build New vApp button. In the New vApp dialog, give the vApp a Name and Description . From the Virtual Datacenter list, choose your VDC. For the purposes of this exercise, you can keep the default Runtime lease and Storage lease , so click Next . In the Add Virtual Machines page, you can create your VM. Add a VM from the UKCloud public catalog by choosing Public Catalogs from the Look in list. Find and select the VM that you want to use, click the Add button and then click Next . You can use the filter fields to limit which VMs appear in the list and use the arrow buttons to scroll through the results. On the Configure Resources page, you can change the VM name in the Virtual Machine field, but keep the default Storage Policy option. Click Next . On the Configure Virtual Machines page, from the Network list, select the externally routed network you created in the first exercise. From the IP Assignment list, choose Static -- IP Pool to use the IP pool you defined earlier when you created your network. You also have another opportunity here to change the name of the VM (in the Computer Name field). Click Next . You don't need to change anything on the Configure Networking page, so click Next . You can find out about network fencing in How to create a vApp network . On the Ready to Complete page, review your settings and then click Finish to start the deployment. When the VM has been provisioned, right-click it and select Power On , then use the popout console to go through the setup procedure. To confirm that you have connectivity to the internet and have an assigned IP address: Type ipconfig into the Command Prompt. If you've configured the networking correctly, your VM will return an IP address. Open an internet browser page and navigate to an external web page Ping the IP address of your DNS (for example, 8.8.8.8 ) through the command line. Next steps In this guide, you've learned how to build a simple virtual machine and connect it to the internet.

    "title": "Getting Started Guide for Disaster Recovery as a Service | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for Disaster Recovery as a Service Overview UKCloud's Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS) is a powerful, self-service replication and recovery tool that can improve organisational resilience and enable seamless migration of applications between your local VMware or Hyper-V powered data centre and UKCloud's disaster recovery enabled regions. This means that in the event of a VM being compromised, for example, a local hardware failure, power outage, security incident (such as theft) or WAN connectivity disruption, you can quickly recover your VMs to the UKCloud platform and ensure that the disruption to your service is minimised. DRaaS is powered by Zerto, a leading provider of disaster recovery software for the cloud. This guide covers the tasks you need to perform to get DRaaS up and running in your environment. Intended audience This guide is intended for any user who needs to set up DRaaS. Introduction to Disaster Recovery as a Service If you provide services from your own data centre or on-site servers, DRaaS can help you achieve a robust and flexible replication and recovery service, with the UKCloud platform as the recovery site. When you have set up DRaaS for your VMs, every write operation to the protected VMs is copied and stored in a journal on the recovery site. This means that in the event of a VM being compromised, you can quickly recover the VM to a point in time before the disaster took place. You add disaster recovery protection to your VMs by adding them to a virtual protection group (VPG). Each VM in the VPG is synchronised to the recovery site on the UKCloud platform, and a journal is created. After this initial synchronisation, each subsequent write operation to the VM is processed as normal on the original site and a copy is asynchronously sent to the UKCloud site and written to the journal. Each journal entry exists in the journal for 14 days (the journal history). When the journal history is reached, as new journal entries are created, older entries are written to the recovery VM's virtual disks. Every few seconds, a checkpoint is written to every journal for each VM in the VPG to ensure crash-consistency between the VMs. If you need to recover a VM, you select a checkpoint to recover to. For example, in the case of a security incident, you could recover to a checkpoint from before the incident. During recovery, the VMs are created in a vApp on the recovery site and the recovery disks for each VM are attached to the recovered VM. Information in the journal is then promoted to the VM to bring it up to the date and time of the selected checkpoint. Two terms you may hear in connection with disaster recovery are recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO). The RPO indicates the amount of data you can afford to lose in the event of a disaster. For example, if your application data changes fairly infrequently, your RPO can be higher as the data remains fairly static. However, if your application data is constantly changing, you'll need your RPO to be smaller to avoid significant loss of data in the event of a disaster. The RTO is the amount of time you can tolerate your application being unavailable in the event of a disaster. For example, if your application provides critical functionality, you'll need to bring it back online very quickly. However, for a less critical application, you may be able to tolerate a longer outage. Because of the use of regular checkpoints (every few seconds), our Zerto-powered DRaaS provides a minimal RPO. The ability to use recovered VMs even before all the journal data has been promoted provides a good RTO as well. Before you begin When you order DRaaS, UKCloud provides you with: The IP address (from the IP range you provided to UKCloud) of the Zerto Cloud Connector (ZCC) deployed in your recovery VDC; you'll need this to complete the setup of the site-to-site VPN between your local environment and your recovery VDC A link to the appropriate version of the Zerto Virtual Manager (ZVM) for you to deploy in your local environment A ZORG ID to identify your Zerto environment within the UKCloud platform Access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal (ZSSP) in the appropriate UKCloud zone, where you can trigger a failover You should consider the following: VMs must be powered on to be synchronised. The operating system used by the protected VMs must also be supported in the recovery site. Disaster Recovery as a Service captures every action. When a VM is deleted, the associated journal is also deleted. We provide a single default service profile. The details of this are available in the DRaaS Service Scope. We do not currently provide the option for you to create custom profiles. System requirements To use DRaaS, you must have a valid, centrally managed vSphere or HyperV estate. A single hypervisor is not sufficient. The following table lists the minimum requirements for DRaaS, based on the currently deployed version of Zerto Virtual Replication (4.5U4) on the UKCloud platform: Product Supported Version Management Plane VMWare vCenter 4.0U1 -- 6.0U2 Microsoft SCVMM 2012 R2 and Server Core: Update Rollup 6-11 (recommended) 2012 R2 and Server Core: RTM Hosts VMWare ESX/ESXi 4.0U1-4.0U3, 4.0U4 , 4.1-6.0U1, 6.0U2 Microsoft Hyper-V 2012 R2 and Server Core Virtual Machines Hardware Version VMWare Up to Version 10 Hyper-V Generation 1&2 Disaster Recovery as a Service Connectivity Full Duplex Internet connection 5Mb/s minimum IPSEC VPN NA For a complete list of hypervisor features supported when using DRaaSe, see: http://s3.amazonaws.com/zertodownload_docs/4.5U4/Zerto%20Virtual%20Replication%20Operability%20Matrix.pdf Getting Disaster Recovery as a Service up and running To get DRaaS up and running in your environment, follow the steps below: Create a recovery VDC Set up your local environment Configure networking on the recovery site Create a virtual protection group Perform a test failover Create a recovery VDC To recover your VMs to the UKCloud platform, you must have a VDC in the intended recovery site. If you already have a compute service in the UKCloud site, you can use an existing VDC or you can create a new one using: The UKCloud Portal (for more information see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware ) The UKCloud Portal API (for more information see the How to use the UKCloud Portal API ) If you don't already have a compute service in the UKCloud site or you'd prefer UKCloud to create the VDC for you, you can request this as part of your DRaaS Service Request. Set up your local environment Before you can start using DRaaS, you need to prepare your local environment by: Installing the appropriate version of Zerto Virtual Manager (ZVM) in your local environment Creating a secure site-to-site VPN between your local environment and the UKCloud platform For more information, see How to install and configure Zerto in your local environment . Configure networking on the recovery site You must configure any internally and externally routed networks in your UKCloud recovery VDC to duplicate those in your local environment. You must also configure the edge gateway with the same firewall, NAT and other rules. You'll create the mapping between these networks when you create your VPG (see How to create a virtual protection group ). In the event of a failover, external access to the recovery VDC will be via a different IP address. You'll need to account for any required DNS changes and external connectivity configuration (such as VPNs), to ensure continued external access. Utilising UKCloud's VMware platform, you can configure this in advance. Alternatively, you can use load balancing technologies to manage a seamless switch between environments. Create a virtual protection group A virtual protection group (VPG) is a collection of VMs that are grouped together for disaster recovery purposes. When you create a VPG, a replica of each VM disk is created on the recovery site. These replica virtual disks are then populated with the data in the protected VMs by synchronising the protected VMs with the recovery site replicas. For more information, see How to create a virtual protection group . Perform a test failover After you create your VPG, we recommend that you perform a test failover to confirm that your VMs will be recovered correctly in the event of a live failover. You should also run test failovers periodically to ensure that your VMs can still be recovered successfully. For more information, see How to perform a failover . Next steps You have now performed all the steps needed to set up DRaaS. If you experience a disaster, you can perform a live failover to recover your VMs on the UKCloud platform and continue operation as usual. For more information, see How to perform a failover . Glossary This section provides a glossary of terms specific to UKCloud's DRaaS. failover When an application switches to an alternative environment in order to ensure continued operation. journal A repository of write operations performed on a protected VM after the initial synchronisation. protected site The local site where your live VMs are located. recovery point objective (RPO) The amount of data you can afford to lose in the event of a disaster. recovery site The UKCloud site to which your VMs are replicated for protection. Sometimes also called the target site. recovery time objective (RTO) The amount of time you can tolerate your application being unavailable in the event of a disaster. virtual protection group (VPG) A collection of VMs that are grouped together for protection purposes.

    "keywords": "General connectivity What options do I have to connect to my solution hosted on the UKCloud Assured OFFICIAL (previously PGA IL2) cloud platform? The UKCloud Assured OFFICAL cloud platform previously achieved CESG Pan Government Accreditation (PGA) and is PSN Accredited to host OFFICIAL data (including OFFICIAL SENSITIVE) which is accessible via the internet or the PSN Assured Service. You can also connect via internet, N3/HSCN and Janet dependant on relevant accreditation. Our Assured OFFICAL cloud platform follows best commercial practice, so certain insecure traffic types are restricted. In general, it's good practice to connect to your Assured OFFICIAL solution via an IPsec VPN (using commercial-grade encryption) which you configure via your self-managed virtual firewall. Within the VPN tunnel, you can use any protocol, giving you maximum flexibility. You can also configure your solution to allow other traffic encrypted using SSL or TLS. Use of non-encrypted traffic should be minimised. As our Assured OFFICIAL cloud platform is PSN Accredited, you can also connect to your solution via our resilient and scalable PSN Assured Service connections. Alternatively, you can use HybridConnect options by, for example, installing your own CAS(T)-compliant private circuit. Can I connect to my solution using SSL VPN? Our Assured OFFICAL and Elevated OFFICAL cloud platforms both support SSL VPN (configured by UKCloud via a Service Request), but we don't recommend it other than for occasional remote administration purposes by a small number of administrators. If you need more extensive use of SSL VPN, we recommend you deploy a dedicated VPN appliance, such as OpenVPN. Can I use UKCloud as a transit or gateway between different connections? No. Our cloud platforms are designed so that all traffic either originates or terminates within our platform. We can't facilitate routing between connections. If your solution needs to service users on different networks, this will need to be implemented, managed and accredited within your application or an authorised gateway service. Do you provide an SLA on internet/PSN/N3(HSCN)/Janet connectivity? We provide an SLA for availability of our core services such as UKCloud for VMware. We cannot provide an SLA on external services as they are outside our control. UKCloud can only provide assurance associated with the native SLAs that are offered as part of the core PSN framework. Why doesn't the UKCloud SLA extend to external connectivity such as PSN and the internet? The UKCloud SLA provides our customers with assurance that our platform is designed, engineered and operated to deliver high levels of availability and uptime. We have invested in skilled and experienced people, ISO 20000-certified IT service management processes and best-in-class technology - all of which underpin our cloud services and allow us to deliver high availability. When it comes to external connectivity, we depend on services provided by third parties. In some cases (such as PSN, Janet and N3/HSCN), we have no choice about which connectivity provider to work with, as this is mandated by the government framework. These services are available only as managed connections, so our SLA can only extend to the inside interface of the managed router deployed and maintained by the third party. Although we work closely with third-party providers to engineer a highly available solution, the actual delivery of the service is not within our control. For more open networks such as the internet, we use multiple connectivity providers to further mitigate the impact of a service failure on the part an individual connectivity provider. Even so, failure scenarios can still occur beyond the UKCloud boundary, which can affect the service that customers receive (for example, congestion on the internet, localised failures within the provider's network or their peering agreement). We plan to introduce secondary PSN connectivity providers to implement similar resilience but, as PSN services are delivered as managed connections, we cannot directly control the PSN routers. What is your policy on IP addressing? We've designed our cloud to give you complete control and autonomy over the private ( RFC 1918 ) IP address space you deploy within your virtual data centre (VDC). You can use the self-managed virtual firewall to implement a VPN tunnel, network address translation (NAT) and load balancing to control how you publish the services within your VDC to external networks. For the UKCloud Assured OFFICIAL cloud platform, we allocate at least five usable RIPE IPv4 addresses which are fully routable on the internet. With these addresses, you can establish: Source NAT - all outbound traffic to other resources on the internet will appear to come from one of these IPv4 addresses. Destination NAT - all inbound traffic from other resources on the internet must be targeted at one of these IPv4 addresses. You can translate the internet IPv4 address to an internal (RFC 1918) IP address assigned to a virtual machine (VM) or, preferably, to the edge gateway load balancer. A VPN - an IPsec VPN can be established between the IPv4 address of the virtual firewall and the IPv4 address of the firewall at another site. Once the VPN has been established, both sites can directly access the internal (RFC 1918) IP addresses. For PSN connections to either of our cloud platforms, the PSN Authority has provided us with a limited allocation of PSN IP addresses . The PSN Authority requires customers who need more than a few PSN IP addresses to use their own PSN IP allocation and, if more are needed, to justify an additional allocation directly with the PSN Authority. UKCloud will work with customers to facilitate the allocation of their PSN IP addresses to their services hosted on our cloud platforms. With the PSN IP addresses, you can establish: Source NAT - all outbound traffic to other resources on the PSN will appear to come from one of these IPv4 addresses. Destination NAT - all inbound traffic from other resources on the PSN must be targeted at one of these IPv4 addresses. You can translate the PSN IPv4 address to an internal (RFC 1918) IP address assigned to a VM or, preferably, to the edge gateway load balancer. A VPN - an IPsec VPN can be established between the IPv4 address of the virtual firewall and the IPv4 address of the firewall at another site. Once the VPN has been established, both sites can directly access the internal (RFC 1918) IP addresses. As both PSN and RIPE IPv4 addresses are in short supply, you must use your addresses as efficiently as possible. Before additional IPv4 addresses can be allocated, you'll need to demonstrate your use of: Load balancing services - enabling a number of web servers to be accessed via a single externally routable IP address Host headers - enabling web servers to accept connections for a number of URLs via a single externally routable IP address VPN tunnelling - enabling the use of internal (RFC 1918) IP addresses for non-production services such as UAT and development Can additional purchased IP addresses be transferred to another VDC? As long as the original VDC is being removed, purchased IP addresses can be transferred to another VDC on the same account. Other scenarios must be discussed with UKCloud. How do I remotely manage my solution hosted on UKCloud? Your cloud solution is designed to be self-managed via the UKCloud Portal or programmatically via a fully documented API. The Portal and API enable you to configure your VDC including the virtual firewall, load balancer, site-to-site VPNs, networks and VMs. You can deploy and manage operating systems and applications using the Portal's remote console function (Windows and Linux only). You can also configure your virtual firewall to allow direct remote management of each VM independent of the Portal or API, for example via IPsec VPNs or SSH. Using a VPN lets you connect directly to each VM using tools such as Remote Desktop, SSH or other management clients. When will UKCloud offer IPv6 addresses? We continue to work with our service providers and technology partners to ensure our platform is ready for IPv6 addressing. How are the two UKCloud data centres connected? UKCloud operates high-bandwidth (multi-Gigabit), low-latency (typically sub-5ms round-trip time) dark fibre connectivity between our two data centres. It's highly resilient as it takes diverse northerly and southerly routes. This data centre interconnectivity is highly scalable, as spare fibre capacity is in place to meet future demand. It uses CAS(T) compliant circuits; and within our Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform, we provide additional overlay encryption using a CPA-approved solution. These have previously achieved Pan Government Accreditation and are PSN accredited to carry OFFICIAL data (including OFFICIAL SENSITIVE), as well as the PSN Assured service and the encrypted PSN Protected service. If I have reserved bandwidth, how do I uplift this? We actively monitor and manage our connections to ensure there is appropriate connectivity to the platform. Customers looking to provide 'guaranteed' connection capacity should include a HybridConnect leased line in their solution. If I use VMs with Geo-resilience (formerly ENHANCED service level), am I still charged for connectivity between data centres? No. The cost of bandwidth required for replication of VMs is included in the hourly cost of the Geo-resilient VM and the monthly cost of additional geo-resilient storage. Can UKCloud help me if I don't have a suitable connection for the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform? We recognise that some customers may be affected by the often extended lead times associated with provisioning new connections suitable for the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform; and that some customers may not have adequate bandwidth to handle bulk import/export activities. To help address these issues, we offer two options: A chargeable Data Transfer Facility which enables you to access the Elevated platform and carry out import/export activities from our secure office. Although you can bring your data/media into our office and benefit from our readily available and suitably accredited connections to the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform for large quantities of data, we recommend the use of the Mass Transfer Facility A chargeable Mass Transfer Facility which enables you to send in HDDs or a populated NAS box which can then be uploaded to your cloud environment. This is aimed at customers with large amounts of data to be uploaded which can be done by authorised UKCloud staff. If you're interested in either of these services, please contact our sales team to discuss your requirements. How do I configure my solution to use the UKCloud data centre interconnection? This depends on the use case. If you have a non geo-resilient VDC in each UKCloud data centre: Configure an IPsec VPN between the edge gateway instances of each VDC. Once the VPN has been established, VMs within the VDC can connect to each another using their private (RFC 1918) IP addresses. If you have VMs in one UKCloud data centre which need to access published services in the other (for example, VMs hosted in DC1 might choose to access Cloud Storage in DC2): The service (for example, our Cloud Storage) will be published using an accessible hostname/IP address. The service should be published on standard ports (for example, HTTP). You simply configure your VMs to connect to the published hostname/IP over the standard ports. If your private circuits or co-located equipment need to use the data centre interconnection: Contact your account manager, as this will be a non-standard solution which may require support from our technical specialists (costs will be as per the SFIA rate card). Does UKCloud support RLI connections? Yes, UKCloud does support an RLI connection for customers who have been already authorised by the MoD. We will then us the HybridConnect service to connect the RLI network to your cloud environment. If I have an MPLS circuit direct into UKCloud, do I still have to go through a PSN connection to access the Elevated Portal? No, you don't need a PSN connection as you can access the Portal from within a VM on the Elevated platform. Are external Domain Name System (DNS) services available? No, we don't currently offer this service. Customers can implement their own DNS servers within their solution, or configure their virtual firewall to enable connectivity to an externally hosted DNS server (for example, those hosted on Government Secure Networks such as PSN, or those available on the internet such as Google 8.8.8.8). Does UKCloud support Janet connectivity? Yes, UKCloud provides a Janet connection provided free for our customers. In order to utilise this network, you will need to be authorised by Jisc. There is no inbound or outbound usage charge for using the Janet connection to access the UKCloud platform.

    "keywords": "Cloud Storage Service Scope About this document This document describes the boundaries of the Cloud Storage service, along with the division of responsibilities between UKCloud and the customer, to facilitate the provisioning and ongoing use of the service. About Cloud Storage Cloud Storage from UKCloud is a secure and highly adaptable storage platform designed to address a wide variety of use cases. As an object storage platform based on Dell EMC's Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS), it is natively optimised for cloud storage in terms of scale, resilience and accessibility. Service options Organisations can choose from two service levels: STANDARD - data is stored in a single named UK-sovereign data centre with data protection using erasure coding. This provides fault tolerance by storing three copies of the data across separate nodes, thus improving data durability. ENHANCED - data is stored in two UK-sovereign data centres, with a copy maintained in a primary named UK data centre and copied to a geographically remote UK data centre. This provides a greater degree of fault tolerance than the STANDARD service level by storing an additional copy of the data in a separate site. If you want more control and visibility of your disaster recovery solution, you can design your solution to write data independently to each data centre at our STANDARD service level, instead of using our ENHANCED service level. Full details of the available service options are outlined in the Service Definition ( Assured | Elevated ). Service availability UKCloud platform availability is based on the service level you purchase. The service level agreement (SLA) for the STANDARD service level guarantees 99.95% availability. The ENHANCED service level SLA guarantees 99.99% availability. In the event of a site failure, there will be an outage to objects created on the failed site. UKCloud will bring these objects online in the other site within 15 minutes. You are entitled to claim Service Credits for outages to services that take you out of SLA. For more about how we calculate SLAs, see the SLA Definition . Service background We actively capacity-manage the cloud platform to ensure you have access to the resources you request. The UKCloud platform is designed using sites, regions and zones. The relationship between them is shown below: You can specify Farnborough or Corsham as the site where you would like to have your service provisioned. We will try to accommodate requests and will advise you if we are unable do so. We control the deployed versions of technology on the platform. This covers internal platform-supporting technologies, and any technology versions available to you. Platform management Users can access, manage and view their Cloud Storage service, in any of the following ways: APIs. You can use either the ECS S3-compatible API or the ECS Atmos API. The APIs are not interchangeable, so you need to choose carefully which API you want to use. Refer to the EMC ECS Data Access Guide for more information on the features of both APIs. Command Line Interface (CLI). CLI tools enable access from the command line by translating commands into the relevant API calls. Storage Gateways. These applications can interact with Cloud Storage via the native API on the back-end and translate it into a more traditional file or block storage protocol at the front-end, enabling a wide variety of use cases. See Blueprint -- Using Storage Gateways with Cloud Storage for more information. UKCloud Portal. Contains information about the namespaces and users within your Cloud Storage environment, as well as a graphical representation of your storage consumption. For more information on the Portal functionality, see How to view Cloud Storage information in the UKCloud Portal . To create additional namespaces or users, you must raise a service request. When requesting additional users, you can specify whether you want these users to have read-write or read-only permissions. We do not currently offer access as an NFS or a HDFS. You cannot access the underlying infrastructure. This includes (but isn't limited to) the hardware and the ECS Portal. Protection You can protect against accidental deletion or modification of data by using retention policies or versioning. Retention policies add a layer of protection by preventing files from being modified or deleted for a specified period of time, making them best suited to static data. Retention policies cannot be applied at the object level -- these API requests will be rejected. Versioning can protect against accidental deletion and modification by keeping multiple variants of an object. When versioning is enabled, any operation that would have overwritten an object retains the old version of the object, enabling you to retrieve or restore to a previous version using the S3 API. Each version of an object will be billable for the storage it consumes, so you may want to implement versioning expiration policies to manage your storage footprint. Encryption at rest can be enabled when creating a new namespace or bucket. This encrypts data inline, using an AES 256-bit algorithm, before it is stored on drives. If you want your data to be encrypted at the namespace level, you must request this functionality before your namespace is created, as encryption cannot be enabled or disabled after a namespace is created. Networks Cloud Storage is available on a range of Assured and Elevated networks. An overview of the available networks in each region is available in UKCloud Services By Region . Cloud Storage in our Assured OFFICAL domain uses the same environment for both PSN Assured and internet connections. Although it isn't possible to bridge between these connections, any objects placed in Cloud Storage via PSN Assured will also be accessible via the internet using the appropriate customer credentials. We manage the physical firewalls that face public and secure networks. Protective monitoring We have implemented GPG 13-aligned Protective Monitoring across the Assured and Elevated platforms at the perimeter of your estate. We don't provide Protective Monitoring services within your estate - it is your responsibility to act at this level. In line with UKCloud's SISP, we provide notification of customer-impacting security incidents. It is your responsibility to report similar incidents to us. Service migration You can request a migration through a Service Request. Migrations may be between: Services (for example, STANDARD to ENHANCED) UKCloud sites or availability zones The Assured and Elevated platforms Customer service Customer Success Manager (CSM). For the first 90 days of the service, you have access to a UKCloud Customer Success Manager, who will help you with your adoption of the UKCloud Cloud Storage service, including finding relevant systems and using UKCloud tools and processes. Cloud Architects. UKCloud Cloud Architects support you during the design of solutions for the cloud platform. UKCloud Cloud Architects are ideally placed to help reconcile your requirements with the UKCloud platform. We recommend engagement with a Cloud Architect when implementing complex solutions. Technical Account Managers (TAM). You will be allocated with an assigned point of contact who will provide ongoing assistance with reporting and incident escalation. Support. After the initial on-boarding and design phase, you can utilise the standard UKCloud support entitlement, which is documented in the Customer Engagement Factsheet . Customer responsibilities Assessing whether the UKCloud platform can support the various requirements of your application and storage needs. The control and management of access and responsibilities for end users including appropriate connectivity, security and accreditation if required. If access is required over government secure networks (N3/HSCN, Janet, RLI or PSN), the customer is responsible for adhering to the relevant Code of Connection (CoCo) and for providing evidence of their CoCo to UKCloud upon request. UKCloud is unable to provide access to secure networks where such evidence has not been provided by the customer. The customer is also responsible for ensuring only lawful data that supports the UK public sector is stored and processed by applications on this environment, and that they fully comply with the UKCloud Security Operating Procedures (SyOPs) and other information assurance requirements as specified in the UKCloud System Interconnect and Security Policy (SISP) and associated accreditation documentation sets. Service provisioning Within 1 day of accepting an order (shorter deployment times are typically achieved and can be prioritised upon request), UKCloud will create the customer's Primary Administrator account and send a Welcome Pack which includes the URL for the UKCloud Customer Portal, and the getting started guide. The customer can then use these details to configure their application (for example GeoDrive, CIFS-ECS, Cloud Tiering Appliance and Documentum) or access Cloud Storage via the API to begin using the service. UKCloud has created a number of videos, help guides, manuals and FAQs to help train and instruct users so that they are up and running quickly and easily. These are available within the Knowledge Centre, accessed via the UKCloud Portal. UKCloud also has a large ecosystem of partners who can deliver additional services, such as support and professional services. UKCloud would be pleased to introduce you to the right partner to suit your needs. Service constraints UKCloud will adhere to the following in terms of maintenance windows: \"Planned Maintenance\" means any pre-planned disruptive maintenance to any of the infrastructure relating to the service. Planned Maintenance activity may result in periods of degradation or loss of availability depending on the nature of the activity required. In such cases, UKCloud shall provide affected customers with at least fourteen (14) days' notice of the Planned Maintenance. If during Planned Maintenance there is a loss of availability outside the scope described in the planned maintenance notification to the service, an SLA event will be triggered. \"Emergency Maintenance\" means any urgent maintenance required to prevent or mitigate against any event compromising the infrastructure relating to the service. Whenever possible, UKCloud shall: a) provide affected customers with at least six (6) hours' advance notice and b) carry out the emergency maintenance between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Friday or between the hours of Saturday 00:00 to 06:00 (UK local time) on Monday, (including bank holidays) unless there is an identified and demonstrable immediate risk to customer environment(s). Emergency Maintenance may result in periods of degradation or loss of availability depending on the nature of the activity required. If during Emergency Maintenance there is a loss of availability to the service, an SLA event will be triggered. This time will be excluded from the availability calculation but will be included in monthly service reporting related to the service.

    "keywords": "How to view Cloud Storage information in the UKCloud Portal Overview Cloud Storage is UKCloud's object storage solution based on Dell EMC Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS). Although you'll mostly interact with Cloud Storage through the API, the UKCloud Portal provides access to some information about your service. Within the UKCloud Portal you can: View information about the namespaces within your Cloud Storage environment View a list of users with access to a namespace Reset the secret key for a Cloud Storage user View information about the buckets within a namespace View a graphical representation of the storage consumed over the last 30 days Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have been granted access to the relevant namespace. Granting Portal permissions for Cloud Storage To view Cloud Storage information in the Portal, users must be granted access to the relevant namespace. Once access is granted, the user will be able to see the namespace, list the buckets in the namespace and reset the secret key. They will also be able to see consumption data for namespaces and buckets, with a graphical representation of average consumption for buckets. To grant Portal permissions for Cloud Storage: Log in to the UKCloud Portal and select your account. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal . In the Portal navigation panel, expand the Contacts option and select All Contacts . Find the contact for whom you want to grant permissions and click the Edit button. Click the Permissions tab. Scroll down to the Permissions for Cloud Storage section and select the Access check box for the relevant namespace. Viewing namespace and bucket information In ECS, objects are stored in buckets. In the UKCloud Portal, you can drill down through your namespaces to see the allocated buckets available in your Cloud Storage service. You can also view storage consumption over the last 30 days. Note It's not possible to view objects within the UKCloud Portal. In the Portal navigation panel, expand the Cloud Storage option and select ECS . The Storage tab lists the namespaces within the currently selected account. You can see: The number of buckets in the namespace The total amount of storage (in GiB) currently consumed by the objects in all the buckets in the namespace The service level of the namespace: STANDARD - data is stored in a single data centre ENHANCED - data is stored in a primary named data centre and copied to a second geographically remote data centre To list the buckets in a namespace, click the Buckets button for the namespace. On the Buckets tab, you can see the following information for each bucket in the selected namespace: The type of bucket: S3 or ATMOS The total amount of storage (in GiB) currently consumed by the objects in the bucket The number of objects in the bucket To view a graph that shows the amount of storage (in GiB) consumed by the objects in the bucket over the last 30 days, click the Show Consumption button for the bucket. Resetting your secret key Each user who can access Cloud Storage has an associated secret key to enable secure authentication. When attempting to access Cloud Storage, you must specify the appropriate secret key. If you forget the secret key for your user ID, you can reset it in the UKCloud Portal. Note For security purposes, the UKCloud Portal does not display secret keys, if you forget your secret key, you must reset it to generate a new one. In the Portal navigation panel, expand the Cloud Storage option and select ECS . Click the Users button for the namespace for which you want to reset the secret key. The Users tab lists the different user IDs associated with the namespace. Click the Reset Secret button next to the appropriate user ID. Click OK to confirm that you want to reset the secret key. Stay on the current page until a popup dialog box displays the new secret key. Make a note of the key and then click Close . Note After you close this dialog box, you will not be able to see the secret key again in the UKCloud Portal. If you do not make a note of the secret key or if you forget or lose it, you will need to reset it again. Next steps This guide has shown you how you can view information about your Cloud Storage service in the UKCloud Portal. For information about how to use the service, see the following articles in the Knowledge Centre: Getting Started Guide for Cloud Storage Blueprint -- Using storage gateways with Cloud Storage Blueprint -- Using file browsers with Cloud Storage Feedback If you have any comments on this document or any other aspect of your UKCloud experience, send them to products@ukcloud.com ."

Known issues There are some known issues that you must be aware of when using CLI in Azure Stack: The CLI interactive mode i.e the az interactive command is not yet supported in Azure Stack. To get the list of virtual machine images available in Azure Stack, use the az vm images list --all command instead of the az vm image list command. Specifying the --all option makes sure that response returns only the images that are available in your Azure Stack environment. Virtual machine image aliases that are available in Azure may not be applicable to Azure Stack. When using virtual machine images, you must use the entire URN parameter (Canonical:UbuntuServer:14.04.3-LTS:1.0.0) instead of the image alias. This URN must match the image specifications as derived from the az vm images list command."

    "title": "How to license Microsoft applications/software on the UKCloud platform | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to licence Microsoft applications/software on the UKCloud platform Overview Important It is your responsibility to ensure that you have a valid licence for any software installed on the UKCloud platform if applicable. This guide is designed to provide information on how Microsoft licensing can be applied on our platform and the options available to you. UKCloud offer two ways to licence Microsoft software for use on our compute platform, providing you with the flexibility you need to deliver your application workloads in line with Microsoft requirements and obligations. These are for UKCloud to purchase these licences monthly for you, or for you to submit a Microsoft Licence Mobility Verification form if you intend to use your own existing licensing. Microsoft Server licensing To make the provisioning of Microsoft-based virtual machines (VMs) as simple and quick as possible, while remaining in line with our Microsoft agreement, all Microsoft Server licences must be provided by UKCloud. The standard licensing approach is for us to provide Microsoft Windows Server licences on a per hour basis. This is retrospectively billed based on your usage of an associated VM. Please note that it is not possible for you to bring your own Microsoft Windows Server licences for use on the UKCloud platform. For your Microsoft Windows Server‑based VMs to use a UKCloud-purchased licence, you must create all your Microsoft VMs using a Microsoft template from the UKCloud product catalogue. If you prefer to create your Microsoft VMs using your own template, you must then register these VMs with our Key Management Server (KMS). A document is available on the UKCloud Knowledge Centre to explain how this is done. The Microsoft Windows Server licence is invoiced each month, in addition to the cost of the VM, based on the VM's usage. We automatically bill the usage of Microsoft Windows Server per hour that the VM is powered on, and invoice you for your consumption of Microsoft Windows Server per month using the following pricing table for G-Cloud 10: VM size SPLA Per hour per VM Academic Per hour per VM Micro, Tiny VM £0.012 £0.002 Small VM £0.023 £0.003 Medium VM, Medium High Memory £0.046 £0.007 Large VM, Large High Memory, Tier One Apps £0.135 £0.020 Due to the elimination of the discount for G-SPLA, there is now price parity with corporate SPLA. As a result, customers who may not have previously been applicable for G-SPLA are not impacted. Microsoft desktop licensing It is not currently possible for you to use Microsoft desktop operating systems on the UKCloud platform. This includes both your own licensing or via UKCloud. However, it is possible for you to bring your own Microsoft desktop licensing for use on a dedicated cloud server such as Private Cloud for Compute. In this instance, please contact your Account Director or your Technical Account Manager for further information. Options for all other Microsoft applications As stated, all Microsoft applications on the UKCloud platform must be licensed appropriately by either UKCloud or by using your own existing licensing. There are two options available to you: UKCloud's Microsoft licensing and usage billing. The standard licensing approach is for us to provide Microsoft licences on a per hour or monthly basis depending on the application. These are retrospectively billed based on your usage of an associated VM for each month. For this option to be valid, you must ensure that you have informed us of all Microsoft installations by raising a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal, detailing the VM names, the application and specific version/level. Please note that not all applications are available using this option, and the Microsoft application list within this document will state the eligibility of this option per application. Bring your own Microsoft licensing. If your organisation has an existing SPLA or Academic licensing contract with Microsoft, or if you wish to licence your Microsoft software directly, we can offer the option of your organisation using your own Microsoft software licensing. Note This is only possible with certain Microsoft applications and is not possible for Microsoft Windows Server as stated above. Before you install any Microsoft software onto a UKCloud VM, you must ensure that you purchase the correct licensing with software assurance and that you have completed the Microsoft Licence Mobility Verification process detailed in this document. The completion of the process is identified by a signed confirmation sent to you from Microsoft Ireland. Please note that if you do not have software assurance, you will not be able to use the Microsoft Mobility option. The Microsoft Mobility option involves transferring the use of your licensing to UKCloud VMs, and therefore they cannot be used on other Cloud Service Providers or on your own hardware. However, if you discontinue the use of the application on the UKCloud platform and no longer require the licensing, this can be reverted for your use elsewhere. The Microsoft Mobility form and guide are available on the UKCloud Knowledge Centre. Please note that this must be completed and posted to Microsoft and not to UKCloud. The correct UKCloud partner agreement number to use is 8392716. Microsoft application list The following list is aimed at providing you with a summary regarding the licensing options available to you for each specific application. This summary states whether UKCloud licensing and/or Microsoft Mobility is available. Please note that this is not intended to be a complete list, but covers the most frequently requested applications. If the application you are looking for is not on this list, please engage with your Account Director or Technical Account Manager who will be able to help and advise you as to whether the software can be licensed and if so how. Microsoft SQL You do not need to purchase licensing for MySQL, SQL Express or PostgreSQL. However, if you are using SQL Standard or Enterprise for development purposes you are required by Microsoft to have valid licensing in place. SQL Developer can only be utilised on a shared platform to test the SQL element of a solution and cannot be used to provide end-user services. If you wish to provide SQL services to end-users, SQL Enterprise or SQL Standard must be purchased. We can provide Microsoft SQL Standard Server licences on a per hour basis, or Microsoft SQL Enterprise licences billed on a monthly basis. These are retrospectively billed based on your usage of an associated VM, and the pricing is available within the G9 Service definitions and pricing guide. Microsoft Mobility - this is a valid option for both SQL Standard and Enterprise. Please note that for under SPLA licensing you only need to purchase the SQL server licence and you do not need to purchase Server Access Licences (SAL). Remote Desktop Server Access Licence UKCloud licensing - we are able to provide Microsoft Remote Desktop (RDS) SAL on a monthly basis only. These are retrospectively billed, and the pricing is available within the G10 Service definitions and pricing guide. For these licences to be used, you must raise a service request prior to their use as they will need to be registered on the UKCloud platform and will need to provision a dedicated RDS licence server. To assign and validate the licences, we will need to arrange a session to connect to your server. Microsoft Mobility - this is a valid option for RDS licences. System Center UKCloud licensing - we are currently unable to offer this as standard or at an additional cost due to our current Microsoft Windows Server licences. Microsoft Mobility - as per Microsoft's terms, you can use your own licensing to cover this software as long as you have active software assurance in place. If you have System Center Datacentre licensing in place this can be used on up to 10 VMs on the UKCloud platform. However, if you own a standard licence, this only covers 2 VMs. The licence can be used for High Availability, Disaster Recovery Solutions and vMotion events giving you full autonomy to design solutions with resilience in mind whilst being fully licensed. SharePoint UKCloud licensing - we are not currently able to offer licences for this application. Microsoft Mobility - Sharepoint Server or Sharepoint Server for internet sites can be licensed through Licence Mobility, only if Software Assurance is in place. Once verified by Microsoft you will be able to use the SharePoint software on the UKCloud platform. Office UKCloud licensing - UKCloud can offer SALs for this software. You need to inform us as to how many users will be accessing the application and we will bill you on a per user, per month basis. This pricing is available on request as it is not currently stated in the G9 service definitions or pricing guide. Microsoft Mobility - this is not available via Microsoft Mobility and must be provided by UKCloud. Visual Studio UKCloud licensing - UKCloud can offer licensing for this software. You need to tell us how many users will be accessing the software and we will bill you on a per user, per month basis. Please note the only versions of Visual Studio permitted by Microsoft are Enterprise and Professional. Microsoft Mobility - this is not available via Microsoft Mobility and must be provided by UKCloud. Other Microsoft Products Please engage with your Account Director or Technical Account Manager who will be able to help and advise you as to whether the software can be licensed, and if so, how. Submitting a request to use Microsoft applications on the UKCloud platform You must advise us of your preferred method for licensing Microsoft applications. To use your existing Microsoft licensing or use licences billed by us on UKCloud‑provisioned VMs: Log in to the UKCloud Portal . Select Support , then My Calls . Select Raise a new Support Call . From the How can we help you? list, select I am requesting information on/administration of my service . From the Select Product list, select Enterprise Compute Cloud (vCloud/VMware) From the What is the nature of your query? list, select either: I want UKCloud to invoice me for the licensing of Microsoft software on one or more VMs . I want to bring my own Microsoft licences to my UKCloud environment Once you have selected one of the two options above, you will need to fill out a Request summary and provide the information outlined below: If you have selected I want to bring my own Microsoft licences to my UKCloud environment, you need to state the specific VDC and VMs that contain the software that will be affected by your own licensing. You will also need to state what software, version, and the quantity of licences you will be using. (You must have completed the Microsoft Mobility verification process before choosing this option.) If your Microsoft Mobility application has been accepted, you need to inform us of the date from which your licensing will take effect. If you have selected I want UKCloud to invoice me for the licensing of Microsoft software on one or more VMs , you need to state the specific VDC and VMs that contain the software you wish UKCloud to licence for you. You will also need to state what software licenses, version, the quantity you require, and the date from which you wish the licensing to commence. Note It is your responsibility to inform support when you no longer require the licensing on one or more of the specified VMs. Click Submit . Validation If you request to use your own licensing, let us know when you have submitted the Mobility Verification form and the support team will update our records. As soon as Microsoft confirm with us that the licences are available, your own Microsoft licensing will be utilised. If you were previously using UKCloud-provided SQL licensing, this will be stopped and you will no longer be billed by us for SQL. Microsoft may contact you to confirm that you have the correct number of licences in place to cover the number of Microsoft-based provisioned VMs supplied by UKCloud. Microsoft SQL Server images To install Microsoft SQL Server Standard or Enterprise edition, you can either use your own local images, or we can make an image available to you. To gain access to any images, you must either inform us so that we can bill you for the appropriate usage, or wait until we've received confirmation from Microsoft as per the mobility process. You can request access to images by raising a Service Request in the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. Responsibilities As soon as you have completed the form and the actions have been confirmed, your organisation is responsible for ensuring that there are enough eligible licences to cover the specified Microsoft-based VMs on the UKCloud platform. Support If you have any issues regarding updating, or the support of Microsoft Server, please contact the UKCloud support team by raising a Service Request.

Static - Manual is similar to Static - IP Pool, but you need to type in a valid IP address from the pool, which the VM will then keep. DHCP vCloud Director interacts with the OS via VMware Tools to use DHCP rather than static IPs. You'll need to define a DHCP server on your edge gateway. Check with UKCloud or your organisation administrator that this is set up before you use it. Click Next . On the Configure Networking page you can change how the vApp and its virtual machines connect to the VDC networks. You can find out about network fencing in How to create a vApp network . Click Next . Review the information on the summary page and then click Finish . The VM will then be deployed as bare metal. Installing an operating system into a bare metal VM On the Home or My Cloud page, right-click the vApp and select Start . This starts the vApp and all the VMs within it. The vApp shows a status of Starting , then Running . Click the monitor display, or right-click on the VM within the vApp and select Popout Console . Note The first time you use vCloud Director, you'll be asked to download a Remote Console client, which is a Windows installable file. You'll only need to do this once. The Remote Console client is available only on Windows, under Internet Explorer (compatibility mode) and Firefox. As with a physical server, no virtual CD or DVD is available at first boot, so the server will attempt to PXE boot. Right-click on the VM within the main vCloud Director interface (not the popout console) and select Insert CD/DVD from Catalog . Select the ISO image you want, then click OK . In the popout console, click the Reset icon then click OK to reset the VM so that it picks up the virtual CD/DVD. After a short while the VM will start the boot process and pick up the CD/DVD. Resize the VM window if necessary to see the whole screen. Carry out the operating system install as normal.

    "keywords": "How to create a vApp Overview vCloud Director uses vApps to make virtual machine (VM) creation and management easy and flexible. vApps are essentially containers for VMs and can be used in many ways. One of the most common uses of a vApp is to group similar VMs together for easy management. Or you can put VMs that form a multi-tier application into the same vApp for greater control. Up to 128 vApps can be created within a virtual data centre (VDC) and intelligently networked to create complex architectures that can be managed easily. In this guide we'll look at how to create a vApp from scratch. Creating a vApp In vCloud Director, on the Home tab, click the Build New vApp button. Enter a name for your vApp. This should be a name that will easily identify it if you're building a large environment with multiple vApps. If you have multiple VDCs on the UKCloud platform, you can decide later which one the new vApp sits in. You can also choose how long the vApp can exist for, which is useful for test & dev projects. When you're happy with these settings, click Next . You can now populate the vApp with VMs. There are several ways to create a VM: From an existing template. The template can be in your own organisation's catalogue or in UKClouds's public catalogue (see How to create a VM from a template ). Catalogue creation is covered in How to create a catalog . From scratch, without using a template (see How to create a virtual machine from scratch ). When you've finished creating your vApp, click Finish .

    "keywords": "How to create an isolated VDC network Overview An organisation virtual data centre network enables its virtual machines (VMs) to communicate with each other or to provide access to external networks. A single VDC can have multiple networks. There are two network flavours, isolated and routed: An isolated (internally connected) network is one that only VMs within the VDC can connect to. This guide describes how to create an isolated VDC network. A routed network (externally connected) provides access to machines and networks outside the VDC via the edge gateway. You can have up to nine usable routed networks per VDC. Creation of routed networks is described in How to create a routed VDC network . Creating an isolated VDC network In vCloud Director, click the Administration tab. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware Double-click the virtual data centre (VDC) that you want to work with, or right-click the VDC and select Open . Select the Org VDC Networks tab. Click the green + icon (or right-click an empty row and select Add Network ) Select the option to Create an isolated network . Click Next . In the Configure Network page, create a network Gateway address and Network mask , and add a DNS if possible. The Static IP pool is similar to DHCP in the sense that it's a range of IP addresses to be consumed by the VMs connecting to the network. When a VM is configured it will have a static manual or a static IP pool address assigned to it. For static manual, enter the address manually. This must be a valid address for the pool. The VM will keep this address for as long as it exists. For static IP pool, enter a range of addresses. A free address from the IP pool will be allocated to the machine automatically. As an example, if you give the gateway address as 192.168.1.1 , you may then want to give a static IP pool of 192.168.1.10 to 192.168.1.100 . This will give you a pool of 91 IP addresses to assign to machines within your network. You can always increase this later if needed. Click Next . Give the network a Name and Description . If you want to make the network shareable with other VDCs, select the Share this network check box. Click Next to review your settings, and then click Finish .You'll then need to create a network gateway address and network mask. Next steps Now you've created your network to connect your VDC with the outside world, may want to configure your edge gateway to control what traffic is allowed into and out of your VDC. You may also wan to start building some VMs. For a quick guide on how to do this, see How to build a virtual machine with UKCloud for VMware .

Note UKCloud provides Windows updates for server operating systems and SQL. Before you establish a connection to the update services, you need to ensure your VMs can communicate with the update server, which exists outside your cloud organisation. This may involve editing the NAT and firewall settings on your edge gateway to allow traffic to traverse out of your virtual data centre (VDC). You'll need to open ports 443 and 80 on your firewall to the update server. For more information on how to do this, see How to create NAT rules and How to create firewall rules . Configuring Windows update In this section you'll need to replace the IP addresses of x.x.x.x with the IP address for the update server you're targeting. The IP address depends on whether your VMs are on the Assured OFFICIAL or Elevated OFFICIAL security domain. To get the IP addresses for the update servers, raise a service via My Calls in the UKCloud Portal. Open a console to the VM you want to update. Test connectivity to the update servers by opening an Internet Explorer browser window, then opening a connection to one of the update servers on https://x.x.x.x . Confirm that a certificate error displays. If it doesn't, connectivity hasn't been established and you'll need to troubleshoot the NAT and firewall rules before you continue.

If this is a different VDC (in the Elevated security domain) or vOrg, go through the steps described above again to create the tunnel. When you've done that, you can change your firewall settings and validate the connection (see below). If you're connecting to an external data centre, you'll need to set up the tunnel on that premises. Creating an external data centre VPN gateway Although we can't provide specific instructions on setting up an external data centre gateway to connect to the edge gateway, we've provided information about some configuration requirements below. IKE Phase 1 and Phase 2 IKE is a standard method for arranging secure, authenticated communications. Phase 1 parameters Phase 1 sets up mutual authentication of the peers, negotiates cryptographic parameters, and creates session keys. The Phase 1 parameters used by an advanced gateway are: Main mode AES/AES256/AES-GCM (user configurable) Diffie-Hellman Group Pre-shared secret (user configurable) SA lifetime of 28800 seconds (eight hours) with no kbytes rekeying ISAKMP aggressive mode disabled The Phase 1 parameters used by a standard edge are: Main mode TripleDES / AES (user configurable) SHA-1 MODP group 2 (1024 bits) Pre-shared secret (user configurable) SA lifetime of 28800 seconds (eight hours) with no kbytes rekeying ISAKMP aggressive mode disabled Phase 2 parameters IKE Phase 2 negotiates an IPSec tunnel by creating keying material for the IPSec tunnel to use (either by using the IKE phase 1 keys as a base or by performing a new key exchange). The IKE Phase 2 parameters supported by an advanced gateway are: AES/AES256/AES-GCM (Will match the Phase 1 setting) ESP tunnel mode Diffie-Hellman Group Perfect forward secrecy for rekeying (only if it was turned on in both endpoints) SA lifetime of 3600 seconds (one hour) with no kbytes rekeying Selectors for all IP protocols, all ports, between the two networks, using IPv4 subnets The IKE Phase 2 parameters supported by a standard edge are: TripleDES / AES (will match the Phase 1 setting) SHA-1 ESP tunnel mode MODP group 2 (1024 bits) Perfect forward secrecy for rekeying SA lifetime of 3600 seconds (one hour) with no kbytes rekeying Selectors for all IP protocols, all ports, between the two networks, using IPv4 subnets Configuring the edge gateway firewall When the VPN tunnel is up and running, you'll need to create firewall rules on the edge gateway for any traffic passing over the tunnel. For how to do this, see How to create firewall rules . Key points to note: You need to create a firewall rule for both directions, that is, from data centre to VDC and from VDC to data centre. For data centre to VDC, set: Source as the source IP range for your external VDC/data centre network Destination as the destination IP range for your VDC network For VDC to data centre, set: Source as the source IP range for your VDC network Destination as the destination IP range for your data centre/VDC network Configuring the external data centre gateway firewall When the VPN tunnel is up and running, you may need to create firewall rules and routes on your on-premises gateway or other internal firewall for traffic passing over the tunnel. This is outside of the scope of this article and will depend on your specific premises network configuration. Validating the tunnel When you've configured both ends of the IPSec tunnel, the connection should start without any issues. To verify the tunnel status in vCloud Director: In vCloud Director, click the Administration tab. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware Double-click the virtual data centre (VDC) in which you set up your VPN, or right-click the VDC and select Open . Select the Edge Gateways tab. Right-click the edge gateway and select Edge Gateway Services . For advanced gateways: Select the Statistics tab and then the IPsec VPN tab. For each configured tunnel, if you can see a tick, the tunnel is up and running and operational. If any other status is shown, you'll need to review your configuration and any firewall rules. For standard edges: - Select the **VPN** tab. - For each configured tunnel you should see an entry in the **Status** column. If it's a green tick, the tunnel is up and operational.

    "keywords": "UKCloud for Microsoft Azure FAQs General What is UKCloud for Microsoft Azure? UKCloud for Microsoft Azure is an extension of Microsoft's own Azure Public Cloud platform, delivered as a service by UKCloud from our assured sovereign data centres. Using UKCloud for Microsoft Azure, developers can build applications using a consistent set of processes and tools that best meets their organisational, technical, and regulatory requirements. Developers can speed up new cloud application development by building on application components from the Azure Marketplace, including open-source tools and technologies. With our Azure solution, we can provide an additional multi-cloud platform option to customers, which reinforces our strategy that one platform does not fit all, while maintaining our UK sovereignty with secure multiple data centres. Why has UKCloud launched UKCloud for Microsoft Azure? UKCloud's strategy is to provide a multi-cloud platform and UKCloud for Microsoft Azure is now available for you to consume as either a secure, UK sovereign implementation of Azure Public Cloud, or as a complimentary platform to work alongside other UKCloud platforms. This allows you to have workloads utilising one or more technology clouds such as Azure, VMware, Oracle and OpenStack on the same trusted infrastructure. What is provided in this service? The first release of UKCloud for Microsoft Azure IaaS provides: Compute Virtual machines (VMs), comprised of CPU, memory and storage, provide the basic compute building blocks in Azure Stack. Initial machine types supported are: General purpose: Basic A series, Standard A & D Series Memory enhanced: DS Series Storage Azure Blob Storage (page): Used to support virtual machine disks. Good for randomly accessed large files. Azure Blob Storage (block): Object storage. Good for storing documents, videos and images for example. Azure Blob Storage (append): Good for log files. Azure Queue Storage: Message queue as a service. Good for asynchronous scale out micro-services. Azure Table Storage: NoSQL database service. Good for highly scalable, eventually consistent database support Network Virtual networks - Configure virtual private clouds and create and manage your private address space within Azure. This can be configured via the UI, API and other tooling. Load balancers (IPv4 only) - Deploy basic load balancers. VPN gateway - Use the Azure Stack VPN gateway to create site-to-site VPNs to remote infrastructure. Routing - Configure basic custom defined routing on virtual networks. What technology is UKCloud for Microsoft Azure based on? UKCloud for Microsoft Azure is based on a CISCO implementation of Microsoft's Azure Stack. Are there any differences between Azure and UKCloud for Microsoft Azure? While UKCloud for Microsoft Azure is developed by Microsoft, some services will take longer to become available. Check the service scope for full details. Initial differences are captured in Understanding UKCloud for Microsoft Azure . Does UKCloud offer an SLA for this service? The SLA for this service is 99.95%. For further details, review the UKCloud for Microsoft Azure Service Definition. Networking How many IP addresses do I get? You're initially allocated three external IP addresses with a new compute service. Do you offer dynamic or static IP addresses? Dynamic internet IP addresses are selected from a pre-defined shared pool. What firewall services are available? Firewall services are provided by Azure Security Groups. More information is available here . How does UKCloud provide urgent maintenance notifications and incident reports? All production services are reported through the UKCloud service status page where you can subscribe to RSS feeds and updates. Are external Domain Name System (DNS) services available? Yes. A similar service to Azure DNS is available. There are some limitations such as no AAAA support. Do you offer load balancing? Yes. This will be offered as an option. You can also deploy your own load balancer. Storage How much storage do I get? You'll get 4TiB, which will be shared between blob, page blob, table and queue storage. Is storage persistent? Storage is persistent unless it is virtual machine temporary storage. Management How do I access my UKCloud for Microsoft Azure solution? Access to the UKCloud for Microsoft Azure portal is available via the UKCloud Portal. You'll be provided with login details once your account is provisioned. How do I access my solutions via government networks? UKCloud for Microsoft Azure will be available on the internet, HSCN, Janet, RLI and PSN networks. Initial access will be from the appropriate UKCloud Portal. What reports can I get about my UKCloud for Microsoft Azure solution? All reporting is via the UKCloud for Microsoft Azure management portal, which provides a variety of reports on the dashboard. You can also interact with the API to pull data into your own reporting solutions. Is this a managed service? No. UKCloud maintains and manages the underlying infrastructure that your solution is based on, but we do not manage your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure solution. How do I manage my services? This service is designed to be managed using the UKCloud for Microsoft Azure portal. You can also manage it through a command line using the UKCloud for Microsoft Azure API. What tools can I use to manage my service? You can use many common DevOps tools, such as ARM, Ansible and PowerShell, to interface with UKCloud for Microsoft Azure. UKCloud for Microsoft Azure also provides a User Interface (UI) to manage the infrastructure via a browser with the same experience as Azure Public Cloud. How long will it take to provision the service? The current provisioning time for a new service is 4 hours from service request submission (during office hours). How quickly can I scale my service up or down? You can scale your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure services either via the UKCloud for Microsoft Azure portal or using the Azure API. This will typically take a few minutes to action. However, if you are likely to increase your requirements significantly, you are advised to plan this with your allocated Technical Account Manager. Support How do I raise a support ticket? The secure online UKCloud Portal provides most common service management functionality. Alternatively, you can contact support by phone or email. What are your service maintenance windows? As far as possible, planned maintenance of UKCloud's infrastructure takes place between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Sunday, or between the hours of 08:00 and 12:00 (UK local time) on a Saturday or Sunday. We provide customers with at least 14 days' advance notice of planned maintenance. As far as possible, emergency maintenance of UKCloud's infrastructure takes place between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Sunday, or between the hours of 08:00 and 12:00 (UK local time) on Saturday or Sunday, unless there is an identified and demonstrable immediate risk to a customer's environment. Whenever possible, we provide customers with at least six hours' advance notice of emergency maintenance. Can I configure email alerts from the portal? Yes. You can receive portal notifications to the email address associated with your UKCloud Portal login. Notifications provide information about updates to UKCloud services, in addition to maintenance and incident notifications. This feature is currently not available in the Elevated Portal. Onboarding How can I get started with the service? Once you have requested a UKCloud for Microsoft Azure environment, your Customer Success Manager (CSM) will introduce you to the platform and relevant supporting documentation. Is there a free trial? Yes, we offer a 30-day trial for this service. How do I request a trial? This can be requested via the UKCloud website trial page, or via your Technical Account Manager if you an existing customer. What do I do when my trial comes to an end? During your 30 day trial period, you will be contacted regularly by your Customer Success Manager who will be on hand to assist you with using the service. When your trial is nearing the 30 day limit, your Account Manager will contact you to discuss the outcome of the trial. If you wish to cancel the service, this will be done for you, and any data will be deleted and the service will be decommissioned. If you wish to commit to using the service, your trial will convert to a full paid service, and you will then be billed according to the Service Definition.

Downloading the vCloud Director healthcheck script You can download the vCloud Director Healthcheck script from the UKCloud GitHub repository: https://github.com/ukcloud/vcd-healthcheck/releases Zip files containing release binaries are available for Windows and Linux, so download the appropriate file for your platform and extract the script. If you are using another platform, for example, Mac, you can download the source code and compile it yourself. Running the vCloud Director healthcheck script To run the vCloud Director Healthcheck script, run the following command: vcd-healthcheck If the script is not in the current directory or a directory in your PATH, you must specify the full path for the file, for example: C:\\scripts\\vcd-healthcheck When prompted enter your user name, password and organisation ID. Note The user name is not the email address that you use to login to the UKCloud Portal. If you are not sure of your user name or organisation ID, you can find them on the UKCloud Portal API page at https://portal.ukcloud.com/user/api . Optionally, you can set your user credentials using the following environment variables to prevent being prompted for them: VCLOUD_USERNAME VCLOUD_PASSWORD VCLOUD_ORG How the script works When you run the vCloud Director healthcheck script, it searches for all VMs accessible to the user account you specified and displays how many it has found. Then, for each VM found by the search, the script checks that it meets the following criteria: Hardware version is 9 Network Device is VMXNET3 Snapshots are not older than seven days For any VMs that do not meet the above recommendations, the results for each check are listed so that you can identify which one(s) failed. For example, in the output below, you can see that out of four VMs found, machine01 and machine04 are both using an E1000 network device and machine01 has one snapshot older than seven days. If all VMs meet the recommendations, the script displays a success message and exits.

Any new edge gateways will be NSX Edges by default. Convert to Advanced Gateway - You can convert your NSX Edges to advanced gateways, which provide access to additional functionality, such as the ability to manage SSL VPN users, as well as: New API NSX management - vCloud Director 8.20 introduces a new proxy API that enables vCloud API clients to make requests to the NSX API. Unlike the NSX API, which is designed to address NSX objects in a global scope, such as a vCenter database, the vCloud Director API for NSX is designed to address NSX objects within the scope of a vCloud Director tenant organisation. Note The API endpoint for configuring edge services will change, so any tooling that you use to amend the edge service configuration, such as adding firewall rules, will no longer work in its current state. NSX Tenant Portal - The Tenant Portal is a pure HTML5 user interface that you can use in conjunction with the legacy vCloud Director Web Console. This portal provides an initial set of controls to configure advanced gateway NSX Edges. Enable SSH on edge - If you enable SSH, you can perform your own packet captures and troubleshoot your edge gateway yourself, without having to contact UKCloud Support. Hardware version - vCloud Director 8.20 increases hardware version support. Guest OS support - vCloud Director 8.20 provides the first formal support for Windows 2016 64-bit.

    "title": "TW_REUSE and TW_RECYCLE settings | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "TW_REUSE and TW_RECYCLE settings Recent releases of the VMware edge gateway networking component have the TW_REUSE and TW_RECYCLEe settings enabled on all interfaces by default. When an edge is redeployed, the configuration reverts to these default settings. These settings are designed to reduce the amount of time TCP connections states are left open, following the cessation of user data traffic flowing across the socket. The reuse and recycle options differ slightly in their operation, with the recycle option being more problematic for devices behind NAT rules. Both of these settings involve a mechanism by which the TIME-WAIT state of the TCP connection is shortened, allowing the server in the client-server relationship (for example, your edge gateway load balancer) to regain ephemeral ports at a faster rate. TW_REUSE uses server-side time-stamps to allow the server to use a time-wait socket port number for outbound communications once the time-stamp is larger than the last received packet. The use of these time-stamps allows duplicate packets or delayed packets from the old connection to be discarded safely. TW_RECYCLE uses the same server-side time-stamps, however it affects both inbound and outbound connections. This is useful when the server is the first party to initiate connection closure. This allows a new client inbound connection from the source IP to the server. Due to this difference, it causes issues where client devices are behind NAT devices, as multiple devices attempting to contact the server may be unable to establish a connection until the Time-Wait state has aged out in its entirety. For a further explanation of the reuse and recycle settings, refer to the following link: http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/2014-tcp-time-wait-state-linux.html Due to the implementation of both of these settings by default, there are instances where TCP sockets are closed prematurely. This is particularly noticeable where a large amount of NAT rules or Load balancers are configured on the edge gateway, with moderate to high traffic throughput. Depending on how the client application layer is designed to handle such interruptions in network layer communications, this may manifest to end users as application hangs or crashes. These settings can be configured by customers with the appropriate permissions through My VMs > Edge Gateway > System Control Settings.

    "title": "Oversized VMs on the UKCloud platform | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Oversized VMs on the UKCloud platform Although UKCloud recommend a maximum permitted configuration of 8vCPU and 96GB RAM for Virtual machines (VMs), a small number of customers have been creating customised VM's that exceed this configuration. We understand that customers may have been doing this in an effort to increase VM performance, and in the most extreme scenarios customers have assigned more vCPU and Memory than is physically available on the host. Unfortunately, this approach does not necessarily increase VM performance and in many circumstances this has the opposite effect. UKCloud have configured the platform to dynamically move workloads to quieter hosts when the current host experiences a sustained level of increased activity. By increasing the resource requirements, the ability to move a VM from a busy host to quieter host is significantly impacted. As the VM resources are increased, the likelihood of that amount being free on another host is significantly diminished which effectively locks the VM to the current host. The impact to a customer VM is twofold: Reducing the reliability of performance Potentially affecting VM availability in the case of a failure UKCloud must also consider the impact that these abnormally large VMs have on other users of the platform as the increased VMs consume additional resources and cause performance issues for other VMs. With this mind, UKCloud advises customers that VMs that exceed the maximum available in our current G Cloud service description for UKCloud for VMware are not allowed. We are currently scoping a technical fix to stop further creation of VMs that exceed the maximum permitted configuration. In the interim, we will be running regular reports to identify customers with VMs that breach these limits. In the first instance we will contact customers to help them overcome some of the issues they are experiencing, but we reserve the right to terminate excessively large VMs should they start to affect the stability of the platform for other UKCloud customers.

    "title": "How to use the UKCloud Portal API | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to use the UKCloud Portal API Overview The UKCloud Portal API enables you to interact programmatically with your UKCloud environment. For example, you can use API calls to create, manage and monitor Service Requests and view information about the components of your environment. This guide shows you how to use the API by providing a worked example that steps through the process of creating a new virtual data centre (VDC). For more information about any of the API endpoints used in this guide, see the UKCloud Portal API User Guide . About the examples in this guide The examples in this guide use endpoints that are available only in regions 5 and 6 of the UKCloud platform. If your environment is in a different region, you won't be able to use these endpoints yourself, however you should still find the guide useful as a reference for how to use the Portal API. For more information about UKCloud regions, see the Understanding sites, regions and zones Quick Ref Guide . The examples in this guide are shown as curl commands, but you may find it easier to work with the API by installing a REST client (for example, Insomnia). Before reading this guide, you may find it useful to understand the following: Versioning - The Portal API uses a version scheme that you can specify in the Accept header: Accept: application/vnd-skyscapecloud-v1 The examples in this guide use V1 of the API. As V1 is the default version, the examples don't explicitly set the API version. Accept headers - Within your API call, set the Accept header for the type of response you'd like returned: Accept: application/json - for a response in JSON format Accept: application/xml - for a response in XML format The examples in this guide accept JSON responses. As JSON is the default format, the examples don't explicitly set the response type. If you require XML responses, you must include the appropriate Accept header. You can add .json or .xml to the end of the API endpoint URL to override the Accept header. Authenticating to the API The Portal API uses session authentication. Before calling any of the API endpoints, you must first authenticate to the API. Send a POST request to the authenticate endpoint. Pass the following parameters in the request body: email - the email address you use to log in to the UKCloud Portal password - the password you use to log in to the UKCloud Portal For example: curl -c cookies.txt 'https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/authenticate' --X POST --d '{ \"email\": \"user@example.com\", \"password\": \"password\" }' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' If the authentication is successful, the endpoint returns a cookie that provides authentication for the next 900 seconds (15 minutes) and a response that tells you how long the session will last: {\"expire_after\":900} If the authentication is unsuccessful, the endpoint returns a 401 status code (Authentication Error). Using the Portal API to create a VDC The steps for creating a VDC are: Requesting a list of accounts Requesting a list of vOrgs Creating a VDC Requesting a list of accounts To create a VDC, you need to know the ID of the account in which you want to create it. If you need to find your account ID, send a GET request to the accounts endpoint to return a list of all your accounts. For example: curl -b cookies.txt 'http://portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/accounts' | json_pp If you need to authenticate to the Portal API first, see Authenticating to the API . The response lists the accounts associated with the email address you authenticated against. Find the account you want to work in and make a note of the account ID. In our example, we want to create a VDC in the account called My Account . The list of accounts returned by the API includes My Account and we can see that the ID of that account is 676 . [ ..., // other accounts filtered out { \"name\": \"My Account\", \"id\": 676 } ] Requesting a list of vOrgs Each account can have multiple vOrgs associated with it, so you also need to know the ID of the vOrg in which you want to create your new VDC. If you don't know the vOrg ID, send a GET request to the vorgs endpoint. If you need to authenticate to the Portal API first, see Authenticating to the API . Pass the following parameter in the request URL: account_id - the ID of the account in which you want to create your VDC For example: curl -b cookies.txt 'https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/accounts/676/vorgs/' | json_pp This returns a list of vOrgs associated with the specified account. A vOrg ID is made up of two numbers separated by a hyphen: the ID of the account to which the vOrg belongs and a number to identify the vOrg within the account. In our example, we want to create our VDC in the vOrg, My Org . We can see from the response to our API call that the vOrg ID we need is 676-2 . { \"data\": [ { \"id\": \"676-2\", \"type\": \"vOrg\", \"attributes\": { \"name\": \"My Org\" } } ] } Creating a VDC When you have the account and vOrg IDs, you can go ahead and create your VDC. Send a POST request to the vdcs endpoint. If you need to authenticate to the Portal API first, see Authenticating to the API . Pass the following parameters in the request URL: account_id - the ID of the account in which you want to create your VDC vorg_id - the unique number that identifies the vOrg in the account in which you want to create your VDC Pass the following parameters in the request body: type - you're creating a VDC, so the type is VDC vmType - the workload type of the VMs in the VDC: ESSENTIAL - VMs can have contended resource allocation; automated rebalancing is enabled to ensure the workload receives the requested performance POWER - VMs have uncontended compute resource allocation; automated rebalancing is enabled to pre-emptively optimise performance and availability PRIORITY - VMs have uncontended compute resource allocation; automated rebalancing is configured to reduce workload movement around the platform name - a name for the VDC; the name can be up to 32 characters long and can include any character except + For example: curl -b cookies.txt 'https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/accounts/676/vorgs/2/vdcs' --i -X POST -d '{ \"data\": { \"type\": \"VDC\", \"attributes\": { \"vmType\": \"POWER\", \"name\": \"My VDC\" } } }' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' Note Use the --i option in the request to view response headers so that you can see the Location header in the response. A successful response to this call includes information about the status of the build and a Location header that provides an address you can use to monitor the build process. The following example shows that the current state of the build is approved , meaning that the request to build the VDC was successful but the VDC creation process has not yet started. HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted ... Content-Type: application/json Location: /api/vdc-builds/9 ... { \"data\": { \"type\": \"VDC-build\", \"id\": \"9\", \"attributes\": { \"createdAt\": \"2016-07-28T14:16:11+01:00\", \"createdBy\": \"user@example.com\", \"state\": \"approved\" } } } Send a GET request to the vdc-builds endpoint to monitor the progress of the build. Pass the following parameter in the request URL: build_id - the ID of the build process In our example, the build ID is 9 , so we can send the following request: curl -b cookies.txt 'https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/vdc-builds/9' | json_pp If the build has started and is still in progress, the state changes to running . For example: { \"data\": { \"type\": \"VDC-build\", \"id\": \"9\", \"attributes\": { \"createdAt\": \"2016-07-28T14:16:11+01:00\", \"createdBy\": \"user\\@example.com\", \"state\": \"running\" } } } If the build has been completed and the VDC has been successfully created, the state changes to completed . For example: { \"data\": { \"type\": \"VDC-build\", \"id\": \"9\", \"attributes\": { \"createdAt\": \"2016-07-28T14:16:11+01:00\", \"createdBy\": \"user@example.com\", \"state\": \"completed\" } } } You have now created your VDC. Using the Portal API to create an edge gateway After creating your VDC, you need to create an edge gateway so that your users can access it. The steps for creating an edge gateway are: Finding the VDC URN Creating an edge gateway Finding the VDC URN The first thing you need to do is find the URN of the VDC for which you want to create the edge gateway. If you don't know the URN, send a GET request to the vdcs endpoint. If you need to authenticate to the Portal API first, see Authenticating to the API . Pass the following parameters in the request URL: account_id - the ID of the account to which the VDC belongs To find an account ID, see Requesting a list of accounts . vorg_id - the ID of the vOrg to which the VDC belongs To find a vOrg ID, see Requesting a list of vOrgs . For example: curl --b cookies.txt 'https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/accounts/676/vorgs/2/vdcs' | json_pp This returns a list of VDCs associated with the specified vOrg. In our example, we want to create an edge gateway for the VDC we just created ( My VDC ). We can see from the response to our API call that the URN we need is urn:vcloud:vdc:1a7570ea-29d9-4090-9714-75c262a123ad . { \"data\": [ { \"id\": \"urn:vcloud:vdc:1a7570ea-29d9-4090-9714-75c262a123ad\", \"type\": \"VDC\", \"attributes\": { \"name\": \"My VDC\" } }, { \"id\": \"urn:vcloud:vdc:f204dc27-c832-4aa5-9abd-19ca83fcfff1\", \"type\": \"VDC\", \"attributes\": { \"name\": \"Another VDC\" } } ] } Make a note of the VDC's full URN. You'll use this in the next step. Creating an edge gateway Now that you have your VDC URN, you can use the Portal API to create your edge gateway. Send a POST request to the edge-gateways endpoint. If you need to authenticate to the Portal API first, see Authenticating to the API . Pass the following parameters in the request URL: account_id - the ID of the account in which you want to create your edge gateway vorg_id - the unique number that identifies the vOrg in the account in which you want to create your edge gateway vdc_urn - the URN of the VDC for which you want to create the edge gateway Pass the following parameter in the request body: type - you're creating an edge gateway, so the type is EdgeGateway connectivityType - the type of connectivity the edge gateway provides into the VDC: Internet - in the Assured security domain External - in the Elevated security domain For example: curl -b cookies.txt -i 'https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/accounts/676/vorgs/2/vdcs/urn:vcloud:vdc:1a7570ea-29d9-4090-9714-75c262a123ad/edge-gateways' -X POST -d \\'{\\ \"data\": { \"type\": \"EdgeGateway\", \"attributes\": { \"connectivityType\": \"Internet\" } } }' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' As when you created your VDC, the response to this call includes a Location header with the build ID so that you can monitor the progress of the build. For example: HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted ... Content-Type: application/json Location: /api/edge-gateway-builds/10 { \"data\": { \"type\": \"EdgeGateway-build\", \"id\": \"10\", \"attributes\": { \"createdAt\": \"2016-07-28T16:41:47+01:00\", \"createdBy\": \"user@example.com\", \"state\": \"approved\" } } } After leaving some time for the edge gateway to be created, send a GET request to the edge-gateway-builds endpoint to check the progress of the build. Pass the following parameter in the request URL: build_id - the ID of the build process For example: curl -b cookies.txt 'https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/edge-gateway-builds/10' | json_pp when the edge gateway has been successfully created, the state changes to completed. For example: { \"data\": { \"type\": \"EdgeGateway-build\", \"id\": \"10\", \"attributes\": { \"createdAt\": \"2016-07-28T16:41:47+01:00\", \"createdBy\": \"user@example.com\", \"state\": \"completed\" } } } You have now created your edge gateway.

    "title": "UKCloud for OpenStack FAQs | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "UKCloud for OpenStack FAQs Service What is the service? UKCloud for OpenStack is an OpenStack powered Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering which enables organisations to rapidly provision and scale secure instances (VMs) in seconds, in a flexible and autonomous manner. UKCloud provides this service across two security domains, Assured OFFICIAL (formerly PGA IL2) and Elevated OFFICIAL (formerly PGA IL3), and with a range of service levels offering up to 99.95% availability. This choice allows customers to precisely match application and user needs to an appropriate security domain, service level and cost, instead of designing to the highest level which may not always be needed. What hypervisor do you use? UKCloud for OpenStack is built using Red Hats KVM hypervisor technology, a trusted solution for implementing virtualized environments. Does UKCloud offer dedicated, bare metal host capabilities (OpenStack Ironic) with UKCloud for OpenStack? UKCloud currently does not offer dedicated, bare metal host capabilities with its UKCloud for OpenStack product. UKCloud offers its 'Private Cloud for Compute' product which provides dedicated compute capabilities for use with OpenStack; please visit the Digital Marketplace or contact your Account Director for further details. Which Disk formats does UKCloud for OpenStack support? The disk format of a virtual machine image is the format of the underlying disk image. Virtual appliance vendors have different formats for laying out the information contained in a virtual machine disk image. Set the disk format for your image to one of the following values: Aki - An Amazon kernel image Ami - An Amazon machine image Ari - An Amazon ramdisk image Iso - An archive format for the data contents of an optical disc, such as CD-ROM qcow2 - Supported by the QEMU emulator that can expand dynamically and supports Copy on Write Raw - An unstructured disk image format; if you have a file without an extension it is possibly a raw format Vdi - Supported by VirtualBox virtual machine monitor and the QEMU emulator Vhd - The VHD disk format, a common disk format used by virtual machine monitors from VMware, Xen, Microsoft, VirtualBox, and others Vmdk - Common disk format supported by many common virtual machine monitors Instances (VMs) Can instances have different service levels? UKCloud for OpenStack is a cloud platform built specifically for cloud native applications which have been engineered to use stateless, disposable instances. Due to the disposable design constructs of customer solutions, only a single service level is required Are instances contended? Instances are contended using the default OpenStack ratios against the following resources: CPU - 16:1 Memory - 1.5:1 Do I get root access onto the instances I deploy? Yes, as this is a true IaaS cloud service, you have complete control and autonomy over each instance you deploy, and so have full 'root' or administrative access. What Instance sizes are available? UKCloud offers a variety of flavours to meet customers' needs. The smallest configuration is 512MiB and 1 vCPU. The largest is 64GiB memory with 8 vCPU. Check the service definition for more details on the currently available sizes. Does UKCloud for OpenStack offer GPU optimised instances? Currently UKCloud does not offer GPU optimised OpenStack instances. Can I resize an Instance? Yes, you can change processor, memory and storage allocations via the self-service Portal and API. Processors and memory can be added to or removed from instances if the OS supports the 'hot add' capability. Increasing CPU or memory allocations may result in the instance being billed at a higher rate. Additional instance storage can be allocated instantly and will be billed on a per GiB basis. What is the speed of each vCPU? This is set at 2.4 GHz across instances. Does UKCloud offer encryption on instances? Not by default but, if it's required, you can implement it using a technology of your choice. Is UKCloud's encryption service available for UKCloud for OpenStack? Not currently, but we are considering options based upon customer feedback. Networking How many IP addresses do I get? You're initially allocated three external IP addresses with each OpenStack project. You can ask for more external IP addresses via a Service Request in the UKCloud Portal. How many network routers do I get? You're initially allocated two network routers with each OpenStack project. You can ask for more external IP addresses via a Service Request in the UKCloud Portal. How many PSN IP addresses do I get? Customer organisations are initially allocated one external PSN IP address. Additional external PSN IP addresses can be requested via a Service Request should a valid business requirement arise. What firewall services are available? UKCloud controls and manages a perimeter firewall on the edge of our Assured cloud platform which securely segregates traffic. You can also use your preferred software firewall and security appliances deployed within your project. Which firewall ports do you suggest to open? To access the infrastructure via the dashboard and API you will need access through any firewalls on the following ports to the OpenStack endpoints you target. 13774, 13696, 13776, 13042, 13292, 13777, 13776, 80, 443, 13004, 13386, 13041, 13000 How does UKCloud provide urgent maintenance notifications and incident reports? You can view these on the notifications page on the UKCloud Portal. In addition, Service Status reports are published on the Portal. Do you offer dynamic or static IP addresses? The external IP addresses are static. Internal IPs can be assigned statically from a pool, manually or dynamically via DHCP. Are external Domain Name System (DNS) services available? No, we don't currently offer this service. You can implement your own DNS servers within your solution, or configure your virtual firewall to enable connectivity to an externally hosted DNS server - for example, one hosted on a government secure network such as PSN or N3; or one available on the Internet such as Google 8.8.8.8. Are domain name registration services available? No, we don't currently offer this service. Some government secure networks (such as PSN and N3) offer domain name registration and DNS hosting as part of their service. For internet-facing services a third-party DNS provider will be required. Is Network Time Protocol available for time synchronisation? Network Time Protocol services will initially only be available via public NTP servers. Can UKCloud provide SSL certificates or can existing SSL certificates be used? UKCloud doesn't provide SSL certificates, but you can use your existing ones. Some government secure networks (such as PSN and N3) provide SSL certificates as part of their service. Do you offer load balancing? Due to OpenStack Neutron not supporting highly available load balancing services, UKCloud has created How to creating load balancing services on UKCloud for OpenStack , which describes how to deploy a HA load balancing solution, of which the first deployed solution is free of charge. We will look to include more native OpenStack functionality once a highly available solution is provided by the community. Can I deploy my own load balancer? Yes, you can deploy your own load-balancing virtual appliance (for example, F5, Stingray, Zeus) if support for other algorithms is required. Do you have an IPSEC VPN connection for uploading sensitive data? We currently do not offer any VPN/Tunnelling as a Service from within the UKCloud for OpenStack product. Customers can create their own VPN endpoints by deploying a software appliance such as pfSense on an instance within their project. Storage How much storage do I get with an instance? The default amount of storage which comes with each instance starts from 10GiB of ephemeral storage and increases as larger instances are consumed. Full details can be found in the UKCloud for OpenStack Service Definition ( Assured | Elevated ). All ephemeral storage is fixed and cannot be increased. How do I scale beyond the default allocation of ephemeral storage? UKCloud for OpenStack is available with persistent block storage options. Persistent block storage is resilient, distributed block storage that can be moved between instances and retain data in the event of an instance becoming destroyed or unavailable. You can quickly and easily allocate additional persistent block storage via the self-service dashboard or API, which will be charged on a per-GiB basis. Can I reallocate storage across instances? No, storage pooling isn't possible. Each instance receives the stated allocation. You can quickly and easily allocate additional persistent block storage via the self-service dashboard or API, which will be charged on a per-GiB basis. Is instance storage persistent? No, the ephemeral storage provided with each instance is non-persistent and any data stored on it will be deleted at the point an instance is terminated. Is Object Storage (OpenStack Swift) available? Unfortunately, the OpenStack Object Storage service (Swift) is not currently available on UKCloud for OpenStack. However, UKCloud offers Cloud Storage, a separate S3 compatible Object Storage service which can be used in conjunction with OpenStack; please visit the Digital Market place or contact your Account Director for further details. What is the fastest way of importing large amounts of data onto the UKCloud platform? The speed of data transfer to the UKCloud platform isn't guaranteed. However, during tests of the upload and download speeds, an average of 8 Mbit/s was achieved for image import/export and 40 Mbit/s for data transferred over FTPS. For a transfer time calculator, click here . If you use FTPS to upload data to or download it from your environment, you can transfer up to 1TiB of data in a day. Management How do I access my solutions via the internet? You can access your instances using: The remote console via the OpenStack dashboard Remote access protocols (such as RDP/SSH) over a VPN or secure network How do I access my solutions via government networks (PSN-A, N3/HSCN)? Although UKCloud allows you to make your customer facing applications accessible via government network connections, the management of your OpenStack environment can only be achieved directly via an internet connection. OpenStack environments in our Elevated OFFICIAL security domain can be managed via the PSN-P network. What reports can I get about instances performance? UKCloud does not currently provide instance performance reports, but you can monitor their performance using standard tools within the operating system. Does UKCloud patch instances? No, you are responsible for the patching of your services. We make a patch repository available to you for instances on the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform (which doesn't cannot connect to the internet) for common operating systems that we provide. How do I find the latest patches to the UKCloud infrastructure? UKCloud maintains a Knowledge Centre article advising the current patch level of the UKCloud infrastructure. See here . How do I access support and patches for operating systems that UKCloud licenses? UKCloud provides a repository of patches for common operating systems for customers to access and update from. Please refer to the onboarding guide or the UKCloud Portal's Knowledge Centre for details. For support, you'll need to log a request with UKCloud, who will log the ticket with the relevant supplier. UKCloud will then inform you about any updates. However, UKCloud isn't responsible for the actual resolution of non-IaaS issues. Do you have a Key Management System (KMS) for activating Windows? Yes. A we provide a step-by-step guide on configuring and using this service. How do I control an instance? You control an instance via the OpenStack dashboard or API. Controls include stop, start, restart, load media, clone, snapshot, and so on. Do you monitor instances? UKCloud monitors the underlying platform but doesn't monitor your OSs or applications. You can implement your own application performance monitoring solutions within your projects. Do you offer autoscaling? OpenStack offers built in autoscaling capabilities using the features of HEAT templates and Ceilometer event monitoring. Blueprints are available on the UKCloud web site to assist with creating autoscaling policies. How quickly can I scale my service up or down? Horizontal scale can be achieved quickly by adding additional instances (usually in seconds). Vertical scaling is not recommended for cloud native applications, but can be achieved by resizing an instance to an alternative flavour type (where supported by the guest OS). Licensing, software and anti-virus What operating systems are available? UKCloud for OpenStack is powered by OpenStack, so is compatible with a wide range of x86/x64 operating systems. You can use the UKCloud catalogue of operating systems or upload your own: For Linux we offer; Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, Ubuntu 14.04 to 16.04 and CentOS 6.0 to 7.2. Windows 2012 R2 & Windows 2016 are fully supported Can I run Microsoft SQL on my instances? Microsoft SQL can be installed within an OpenStack instance. You have the choice to either bring your own license using the Microsoft License Mobility scheme or choose to use a UKCloud provided license. The process for both options are available on the UKCloud Knowledge Centre here . How can I license an operating system? Microsoft Microsoft terms and conditions preclude customers from using their own licence agreements for Windows Server in the Cloud. That means all licensing for Windows Server operating systems must be provided by UKCloud. Microsoft offers License Mobility, a scheme that allows a customer to provide additional software such as Exchange, SQL and so on, as long as the customer has appropriate Microsoft licensing as per the licence terms, conditions and usage rights. RHEL RHEL operating systems can be licensed by the customer directly with Red Hat. We are Currently unable to provide RHEL licences for UKCloud for Openstack. The customer is responsible for ensuring correct licensing for any other operating system they chose to install. How up to date are the operating system images and mirrors? All CentOS, Ubuntu, Red Hat and Debian distributions are automatically updated to contain the latest patches and releases. For a list of supported operating systems, and instructions on how to access these repositories, see the appropriate article in the Knowledge Centre. What anti-virus do you offer on this service? Customers are advised to install their own anti-virus (AV) software, as UKCloud doesn't provide any. What applications are available as part of the default service? UKCloud does not offer any additional software other than what's included in the UKCloud Portal catalogue. Any additional software, including its licensing, is your responsibility. What is Bring Your Own (BYO) licensing for Red Hat? BYO licensing for Red Hat allows customers to select instances running on the UKCloud Assured cloud platform for covering by their own commercial agreement with Red Hat. UKCloud will remove the cost of the Red Hat licence from your monthly bill for the selected instances. You need to raise a Service Request to let us know which instances you will cover with your own Red Hat licence. Support How do I raise a support ticket? The secure online UKCloud Portal provides most common service management functionality. You can raise tickets within the My Calls section of the Portal. Alternatively, you can contact support by phone or email. How do I manage my services? Services on the Assured OFFICIAL platform can be managed over the internet (or other connectivity) via the UKCloud Portal. For the Elevated OFFICIAL platform, security requirements are stricter and require either a PSN-approved connection, UKCloud Secure Remote Access or a self-managed CPA-approved VPN solution (for example site-to-site VPN). What are your service maintenance windows? As far as possible, planned maintenance of UKCloud's infrastructure takes place periodically and at a time which aims to minimise customer impact. We provide customers with at least 14 days' advance notice of planned maintenance. As far as possible, emergency maintenance of UKCloud's infrastructure takes place between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Friday, or between the hours of 08:00 and 12:00 (UK local time) on Saturday or Sunday, unless there is an identified and demonstrable immediate risk to a customer's environment. Whenever possible, we provide customers with at least six hours' advance notice of emergency maintenance. Can I configure email alerts from the Portal? Yes, you can have Portal notifications sent to you at the email address associated with your Portal login. Notifications provide information about updates to UKCloud services, in addition to maintenance and incident notifications. This feature is currently not available in the Elevated Portal. Service Limitations Are there any restrictions on the number of instances I can create or manipulate in a single request? Although designed to be a large-scale cloud platform, we strongly advise that when performing operations/requests against UKCloud for OpenStack you perform these actions in batches of no more than 30 (for example, only creating batches of up to 30 new instances in a single request). Additional requests can then be made to the platform for subsequent batches. How can I create additional OpenStack Projects? Unfortunately, we are currently unable to offer customers of UKCloud for OpenStack the ability to create their own additional OpenStack Projects. Additional projects are allowed, however these need to be created by UKCloud via a Service Request from within the UKCloud Portal. How can I create additional OpenStack Users? Unfortunately, we are currently unable to offer customers of UKCloud for OpenStack the ability to create their own additional OpenStack users. Additional users are allowed, however these need to be created by UKCloud via a Service Request from within the UKCloud Portal. Onboarding How can I get started with the service? Within four hours of accepting your order, we'll create your primary administrator account, and send you a Welcome Pack, which includes the URL for the UKCloud Portal and associated authentication details. Your administrator can then create additional accounts for users within the project. Each user can then log on and begin using the service (depending on the security domain and connectivity). At the time of order, you can specify which of our two UK data centres you'd like to be deployed into. Meeting your request is at UKCloud's discretion. Is there a free trial? We offer a 30-day free trial so that you can test and evaluate our service without commitment. Your trial provides you with a live environment on the UKCloud platform to test our services and check whether they're suited to your needs. Before your trial, a Cloud Architect will engage with you to identify the goals you're working towards, to help ensure that your trial meets those goals. Throughout the trial period, a Customer Success Manager (CSM) will provide support for any issues you may encounter or questions you may have. At the end of your free trial, you can seamlessly move to a billed service, leveraging any of the work you've already completed in the live trial environment. Backup Does UKCloud back up my projects or instances? UKCloud for OpenStack is a cloud platform built specifically for cloud native applications which have been engineered to use stateless, disposable instances. UKCloud does not provided automated backups of projects or instances, however it does allow consumers to create snapshots of their instances via the OpenStack dashboard or programmatically via the API. These snapshots when used in conjunction with deployment orchestration tools or infrastructure as code templates such as HEAT allow for environments to be rapidly replicate, redeploy or scale environments. Can I create scheduled snapshots? Snapshots cannot currently be scheduled directly through OpenStack, however custom scripts can be created and are available on the internet to enable snapshots to be programmatically set. How quickly can a snapshot be restored? Snapshots recovery is full self-service and can be invoked by customers at any time via the OpenStack dashboard or API. What is the Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of the snapshots? The RPO is totally within the customers control. For example, you could programmatically schedule a snapshot to run every hour or even every minute, at which point their RPO would match the frequency of your snapshots. We don't set a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) on snapshot recovery, but this is a fully self-service function available to the customer via the dashboard or API, with restoration times never exceeding two minutes (this will depend on the size of instance being recovered). Where are snapshots stored? By default, all snapshots are stored to our persistent block storage to provide data resilience. Persistent block storage will be charged by the GiB. Can I use my own backup software? Yes, you simply install appropriate backup software within your project and specify the backup location. A typical scenario would involve using a commercial backup solution (such as Symantec NetBackup, CommVault or EMC NetWorker) that points to a cloud storage service such as our Cloud Storage. Billing and legal What is the smallest unit of time I will be billed for? The minimum unit of time for use is one hour. Part hours will be rounded up. Will I be charged for instances in a 'Shut Off' state? UKCloud will continue to charge for any resources that exist within your OpenStack project regardless of the state they're in. In order to stop any charges an instance must be fully 'Terminated'. What are the charges to transfer data between projects within the same data centre? None. Data transfer between projects in this scenario is free. How can I view billing information? Real-time billing information is currently not available as a service provided by UKCloud, however customers are able to query the OpenStack Ceilometer API to query live event data. Historic billing information is available via the UKCloud Portal. How can I pay for the services? Billing for the service is: Via Purchase Order At point of order for up-front fees Annually in advance for pre-payment fees Monthly in arrears for monthly fees Payment can be made by direct bank transfer (BACS/CHAPS). How are snapshots charged? You will only ever be charged for the amount of Tier 1 or Tier 2 storage your snapshots consume, that you have scheduled via the OpenStack dashboard or the API - we do not place any additional premium on-top for the snapshot functionality. To calculate an estimated cost of performing snapshots on UKCloud for OpenStack, simply use the following formula: Cost £ = Instance Size (GiB) x Number of Snapshots to be retained (Customer controlled) x Choice of Storage (Tier 1 @ £0.25 or Tier 2 @ £0.10) As an example: If a customer has an 80GiB Tier 2 instance, and performs a snapshot every hour, but only wants to keep the current snapshot, plus the last nine snapshots then: 80 GiB x 10 (snapshots) x £0.10 = £80 per month What are the termination fees? There are no termination costs for this service. Customers are responsible for extracting their own data from the UKCloud for OpenStack service if required. UKCloud may make an additional charge for transferring data out of the service. Security What data is suitable for the UKCloud assured cloud platform? The service is hosted in the UK and operated by security-cleared staff. It has extensive independent validation (including CESG) that it is fully aligned with the 14 CESG Cloud Security Principles, and is therefore ideal for all data classified at OFFICIAL (including OFFICIAL SENSITIVE). Can systems on different UKCloud platforms communicate with one and another? UKCloud's Cross Domain Security Zone allows customers to use the UKCloud-defined and managed UKCloud Guard, or a customer-designed and managed Walled Garden to enable communication between platforms. For more information, see the Cross Domain Security Zone documentation. Is there a protective monitoring service? Protective monitoring is included for our IaaS platform and follows GPG 13.

    "keywords": "How to obtain usage metrics to use for OpenShift capacity management Overview This article provides examples of the self-service commands you can execute against your UKCloud for OpenShift cluster to gain usage metrics and statistics to help manage your ongoing capacity requirements. A UKCloud deployed OpenShift cluster comprises a single Starter Pack, plus a number of Runtime Packs as required by your workload demands. Starter Pack - Provides the foundation OpenShift services to support the orchestration and management of the container runtime environments, along with additional infrastructure nodes to support services such as log aggregation and metric collection. Each customer environment requires only a single Starter Pack. Runtime Pack - Nodes on which your containerised applications and services run. You have the choice of difference size Runtime Packs. You can call off Runtime Packs individually, however, we strongly recommend the initial deployment of two or more Runtime Packs for production environments to provide resilience to your workloads in the event of the failure of a single Runtime Pack. To add or remove Runtime Packs, raise a Service Request via the UKCloud Portal. The sections in this guide, show you how to obtain various statistics about the platform, including: Overall status of each node in the cluster Uptime per node CPU usage Memory usage Block storage consumption (used by persistent volumes) Object storage consumption (used by the registry) Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have access to and a working knowledge of oc , the OpenStack command-line client (CLI). For more information, see OpenShift's Get Started with the CLI . Identifying capacity statistics The OpenStack CLI provides the ability to list the nodes in your cluster and then retrieve status information about a specific node. You can use this information to determine if the nodes in your cluster have enough available disk space and memory. To obtain the list of nodes that make up the OpenStack cluster, enter the following command: oc get nodes The results show you the overall readiness of each node and how long they've been running. For example: To find the detailed status of a node, enter the following command: oc describe node <nodename> The results show a large amount of information about disk status (pressure and out-of-disk), memory pressure and usage, CPU usage and resource consumption from any running pods. For example: You can also obtain some of the above information via the REST API, by using something like: curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $token\" -H 'Accept: application/json' https://ocp.\\$clustername:8443/api/v1/nodes For more information about accessing this data, see How to monitor your OpenShift cluster . Identifying block storage consumption For capacity management, it's also useful to know much block storage your cluster is using. To obtain block storage consumption (persistent volumes) information, enter the following command: oc get pv The results will look similar to the following, where we can see there is one item consuming 50 GB of storage. Identifying object storage consumption Object storage is used only for the OpenShift registry, therefore, you can calculate how much object storage your cluster is using by adding up the resources in the registry. To obtain information about resources in the registry, enter the following two commands: oc adm top imagestreams oc adm top images The output from these commands will look something like the following: Note For the oc adm top command to work, Hawkular must be running in your cluster. This command can also report on nodes and pods. The appendix at the end of this guide provides some sample Python code to sum the sizes of resources from these two oc adm top commands. Other monitoring options You can find a simple example of a custom monitoring application, using the REST API described above, in How to monitor your OpenShift cluster and as a UKCloud blog post . You can also perform monitoring using Hawkular, which is built into the product. You can access Hawkular from the browser-based console at: https://ocp.<your-deployment-name>.cna.ukcloud.com:8443 Or directly at: https://hawkular-metrics.<your-deployment-name>.cna.ukcloud.com/hawkular/metrics Next steps Further cluster capacity management options are discussed at: https://blog.openshift.com/full-cluster-capacity-management-monitoring-openshift Appendix - Example code for adding up storage contents You can use the following code to add up the values from oc adm top . #!/usr/bin/env python3 \"\"\" Add up storage values. oc adm top imagestreams gives us storage usage for each storage use for each imagestream, and oc adm top images gives us the same for images Storage is suffixed with 'MiB' or 'GiB', so each value needs converting to a number before we can add them up.

    "keywords": "Storage policies Overview Each Virtual Machine (VM) is bound to a storage policy whereby the storage policy guarantees a certain level of capacity, performance, availability, redundancy, and so on from a storage perspective. Note A storage policy does not contain a VMs data; it merely defines the storage service level. When you create virtual machines (VMs) within vCloud Director, as part of the process you will be prompted to choose a storage policy to assign to that particular virtual machine. This will be presented as a drop-down list where you will have a few options depending on the service level of your VDC. An example of this is below, showing the storage policies available on the Basic service level. The ability to choose storage policies is useful in certain scenarios where VMs are required to be on different underlying storage. An example of this would be a replicated database server with separation of replicas onto different storage profiles. Storage policies description Storage policies enable you to choose where the VM sits on the underlying infrastructure, giving you flexibility in terms of VM placement. The storage profiles are all at the same storage tier (for example, Basic) and all make use of the array in the same way (that is, the same mix of flash, SAS and NL-SAS). We provide three storage profiles to provide you with the option of influencing where the VM/data is located. STANDARD-Any is the default and allows for the VM to be placed as UKCloud determine. STANDARD-Storage1 and STANDARD-Storage2 are the profiles that allow the storage placement to be decided by you. VMs associated with Storage1 are located on different data stores and disks compared to VMs associated with Storage2 . Limitations Customers with Optimised Storage enabled (service request via the UKCloud Portal) will be able to select their Optimised Storage policy within the drop-down box shown above. Beyond this, UKCloud only offer Storage1 and Storage2 storage policies, and don't scale this out further.

    "title": "Understanding connectivity options in UKCloud for VMware | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Understanding connectivity options in UKCloud for VMware Introduction In UKCloud for VMware, UKCloud uses two different architecture designs. You can see this when you deploy virtual data centres (VDCs) onto our IaaS offering. Depending on the type of application you're running, you may see one or both types of network architecture when you deploy your solutions onto the UKCloud platform. This document explains what the different architectures look like so you can design your solutions to make the best use of them. Overview of UKCloud for VMware network architecture Our UKCloud for VMware service uses multiple security domains (Assured, Elevated and the Cross Domain Security Zone), enabling you to provide a service over the internet, government community networks (such as N3, PSN or JANET) or your own HybridConnect lines. Each of these networks brings its own challenges for network separation and prevention of accidental bridging. Our network architecture offers two different options to address these challenges. Your Cloud Architect will be able to advise you which solution works best for your application. Network Firewall Tenant (NFT) - NFTs are either single- or multi tenant instances on Network Firewalls (NFWs), depending on the network that the VDC is connected to. NFWs share an external network connectivity layer connected to the government community network. NFT architecture is used in regions 1, 2, 7 and 8. Cloud Fabric and gateway - There are no NFTs on shared firewalls, instead we use a shared Cloud Fabric and the separation of connection types is done at the edge level. Cloud Fabric and gateway architecture is used in regions 5 and 6. NFT network architecture With our NFT network architecture, we use a slightly different design, depending on the network you are connecting to. If you've already used UKCloud IaaS then you'll probably already be familiar with the way the NFT architecture presents itself. Single network architecture (internet) All VDCs on the Assured platform have outbound connectivity to the internet. When connecting a VDC to the internet (and no other network), we use the architecture shown the diagram below. You can see that Customer 1 has two VDCs, each of which has its own edge connected to the same NFT. Customer 1 and Customer 2 have separate NFTs on the same multi‑tenant NFW, which is on the shared internet facing network. From a customer management experience, you manage all your connectivity rules, such as firewall, IPsec VPN and NAT functionality, through your edge, using either the UKCloud Portal GUI or API. We manage the NFW and provide additional controls around whitelisted ports, metering and packet shaping. Multiple network architecture (PSN Assured and N3) If you want to add other networks to your VDC (for example, the health and social care network (N3) or PSN Assured), you can enable these connections through the same edge as your internet connection. This is possible because the separation of connectivity happens at the NFT. The NFT resides on a single tenant NFW to comply with the security requirements of these networks. In the diagram above, you can see that Customer 3 uses the same edge to connect to both the internet and the N3 network through an NFT on a single tenant NFW. Customer 4 uses a similar architecture to connect to the internet and PSN Assured. Management-wise, you can see the external IP range on the edge. Typically, you use this range for internet connectivity. However, in the case of PSN Assured and N3, we translate the address on the NFW before routing it to the edge. You won't see your PSN Assured or N3 address in your IP allocation, but your users will need to target the address to reach your service. PSN Assured If you're adding PSN Assured connectivity to a VDC, we translate each PSN Assured IP address to one of your external IP allocations, consuming one of your internet IPs. N3 If you're adding N3 connectivity to a VDC, we translate the N3 IP to one of the following: One of your external IP allocations, consuming an internet IP. A private address of your choice, bypassing the edge and enabling you to route the traffic directly to a virtual machine (VM) with the same private address. This retains your external IP allocation but limits the use of your N3 IP address. Multiple network architecture (Janet) If you want to connect to the Janet network, the network architecture is slightly different to that of other government community networks. As Janet is a new network in the UKCloud portfolio, we're able to leverage the changes to network connectivity in UKCloud for VMware. This means we can utilise the Cloud Fabric and Gateway model to present the Janet connection. In the diagram above, you can see two edges on the VDC: one presents the internet connectivity, and the other presents the Janet connectivity. The Janet-facing edge connects into the Janet Cloud Fabric and then out to the Janet network via the UKCloud managed gateway. The Janet facing edge has the same functionality as the internet facing edge and you can see your Janet IP address in the IP allocations on the edge. You manage the internet facing and Janet facing edges separately through the UKCloud Portal GUI or API. Networking in the Elevated platform Networking in the Elevated platform is very similar to the Assured platform. All connectivity is routed through the same edge on the VDC, and separation of connections occurs within the NFT. PSN Protected In the diagram above, Customer 1's PSN Protected connection is routed to their NFT sitting in the multi-tenant NFW. This then provides the onward connection to Customer 1's edge. The same NFT also handles the connections in from Cross Domain Security Zone products (Walled Garden, UKCloud Guard and SRA). It's worth noting that UKCloud translates the PSN Protected IP address to one of the external IP ranges that are available on the edge. Your users will target the PSN Protected IP address, however you'll see only your UKCloud allocated external range on your edge, so it's important to know what your PSN Protected IP has been translated to. RLI The RLI is also available in the Elevated platform, however it is not natively connected to the UKCloud platform. This means that, to facilitate a connection to the RLI, you must go through the assurance process provided by the MOD to gain access to the RLI; only then can we complete the connection between the RLI and your VDC. The NFT for RLI sits in a single tenant NFW in line with MOD connection compliance. Networking between VDCs You have three options when networking between VDCs. Each option has a slightly different use case. Option 1: Shared networks Shared networks are useful when you have multiple VDCs within the same organisation boundary (sometimes referred to as a vOrg). You can create networks that span VDCs, enabling VMs within different VDCs to communicate with each other. This is particularly useful if you have VDCs with VMs that are operating at different service levels (ESSENTIAL, POWER and PRIORITY) and need to have inter-VM communication. Option 2: IPsec VPN If you need VDC communication between VDCs that reside either in different regions, vOrgs or even in external data centres then you should use IPsec VPN tunnels. You can configure these on the edges of the VDCs that you are connecting. It's worth noting that you should configure the IPsec tunnels using your external IP address allocation, in both the Assured and Elevated platforms. In the Assured platform, each IPsec tunnel consumes an external (internet) IP. Option 3: Static routes Use static routes as an alternative to a shared network where you want more control of traffic between VMs if the VDCs you're connecting reside on the same NFT. As traffic must traverse the edge, you can put in extra rules around connectivity to lock down communication between VMs in different VDCs. This enables you to construct DMZs or separate out services to different users while continuing to communicate between your VMs. Bringing your own firewall In most circumstances, the UKCloud provided edge will work for your solution. However, if your solution requires next generation firewall functionality, such as malware detection, antivirus protection, URL filtering or complex load balancing, you can provide your own firewall solution. Note that if you choose to bring your own firewall, you're completely responsible for the deployment, configuration and management of that firewall. If you plan to deploy a firewall into a new VDC, let us know and we'll provision you a VDC with a dedicated network for you to deploy your firewall onto. If you change from a UKCloud‑provided firewall to your own firewall, we'll redeploy your firewall on to a dedicated network and you'll need to migrate your environment to that network. IP address allocations When you create a new vOrg, we'll provide you with a number of usable IP addresses per project, depending on the network you are connecting to: Internet - 5 x usable IPs N3 - 1 x usable IP PSN Assured - 1 x usable IP Janet - 1 x usable IP PSN Protected - 1 x usable IP You can request additional IP addresses as required via a Service Request. If you ask for a large number of IP addresses in a single request, we may ask you to provide further information to support your request. Cloud Fabric and gateway architecture The Cloud Fabric architecture utilises multi-tenant networks connected to UKCloud-managed gateways that provide external network connectivity to internet and government networks. The customer-managed edges are connected to the multi-tenant network and enable you to control firewall settings such as NAT, VPN and load balancing. There are no NFTs in the Cloud Fabric architecture so all the firewall settings are controlled by the edge VM. Single network architecture The diagram below shows how VDCs connected to a single network look using our new Cloud Fabric and gateway architecture. You can see that there is no NFT layer; instead each customer VDC has a edge that is connected directly into the multi‑tenant Cloud Fabric. This is then connected to a UKCloud‑managed gateway with onward connection to the internet. From a customer management experience, you manage all your connectivity rules, such as firewall, IPsec VPN and NAT functionality through your edge, using either the UKCloud Portal GUI or API. UKCloud controls the gateway out to the internet and provides metering and packet shaping, however you are in full control of ports. Multiple network architecture Most differences between NFT and Cloud Fabric can be seen with multiple network architectures. To achieve network separation and ensure security and compliance with government community networks, we've developed a new VDC edge architecture. In the diagram above, you can see that if you want to add other networks to your VDC (for example, N3, PSN Assured or Janet), you need separate edges to facilitate that connection. These edges have the same style of connectivity as the internet facing edge: an edge that connects into a Cloud Fabric, dedicated to that particular network, which then has onward connectivity to the government community network through the UKCloud‑managed gateway. Customer management is on a per-edge basis. You'll see multiple edges within your UKCloud Portal GUI and you'll need to manage these individually. The full functionality of each edge is available for every network connectivity, however UKCloud manages the port whitelist for all government connected networks. Network architecture for the Elevated platform Networking in the Elevated platform is the same as the Assured platform from a management perspective. Just like the Assured platform, there is edge separation for the different networks that feed into the Elevated platform. As the diagram above shows, the edge is connected to a Cloud Fabric with nward connectivity to the PSN Protected network. There is also an internal Cloud Fabric that connects the Elevated VDC to the Walled Garden, enabling cross-security domain communication. Networking between VDCs You have two options for communicating between VDCs. Both these options will be familiar if you already use our platform, but if you're used to using static routes, you'll need to use one of the two options below instead for all inter-VDC communication. Option 1: Shared networks Shared networks are useful when you have multiple VDCs within the same vOrg and region. You can create networks that span between VDCs, enabling VMs within different VDCs to communicate. This is particularly useful if you have VDCs with VMs that are operating at different service levels (ESSENTIAL, POWER and PRIORITY) and need to have inter-VM communication. Option 2: IPsec VPN If you need VDC communication between VDCs that reside either in different regions, vOrgs or even in external data centres then you should use IPsec VPN tunnels. You can configure these on the edges of the VDCs that you are connecting. It's worth noting that you should configure the IPsec tunnels using your external IP address allocation, in both the Assured and Elevated platforms. In the Assured platform, each IPsec tunnel consumes an external (internet) IP. In the Elevated platform each IPsec tunnel consumes either: An external (UKCloud) IP, if the tunnel is configured between VDCs An external (PSN Protected) IP, if the tunnel is configured between a VDC and an endpoint on the PSN Protected network Bringing your own firewall In most circumstances, the UKCloud‑provided edge will work for your solution. However, if your solution requires next generation firewall functionality, such as malware detection, antivirus protection, URL filtering or complex load balancing, you can provide your own firewall solution. Note that if you choose to bring your own firewall, you're completely responsible for the deployment, configuration and management of that firewall. If you plan to deploy a firewall into a new VDC, let us know and we'll provision you a VDC with a dedicated network for you to deploy your firewall onto. If you change from a UKCloud‑provided firewall to your own firewall, we'll redeploy your firewall on to a dedicated network and you'll need to migrate your environment to that network. IP address allocation The number of public IP addresses we provide depends on whether you are using a UKCloud‑provided firewall or bringing your own: UKCloud provided firewall - If you're using a UKCloud‑provided firewall, we'll allocate you a single usable IP per VDC edge. You can request additional IP addresses as required via a Service Request. If you ask for a large number of IP addresses in a single request, we may ask you to provide further information to support your request. BYOF - If you're using your own firewall technology, when you provision your VDC, we initially allocate you five public IP addresses. After this initial allocation, you can request more IP addresses by opening a Service Request. Maintaining compliance with multiple networks When connecting to the different UKCloud networks it's important to ensure that you uphold network connection compliance. To this end, the way you access the different government community networks has not changed in Enterprise Cloud Compute. In the Assured platform, you'll always have an internet connected edge. Access to other networks is as follows: For N3 you'll need to go through the UKCloud aggregation process For PSN Assured you'll need to get accreditation for the service you wish to provide from the PSN Authority For Janet you'll need to engage with your Cloud Architect In the Elevated platform: For PSN Protected you'll need to gain approval from the PSN Authority For RLI you'll need to get approval from the MOD For Cross Domain Security Zone services (Walled Garden, UKCloud Guard or SRA) you'll need to get the authorisation from your end-customer IA as well as the UKCloud SIRO The application processes haven't changed for any of these services, however it's important to be mindful about how you may have to design your architecture based on the network architecture you'll be deployed on. As an example, when connecting to the N3 network, you'll need to ensure that the N3 and internet networks aren't bridged. With the Cloud Fabric architecture and NFT architecture (shown in the two diagrams below respectively), you should ensure that VMs are not connected to both the internet and to N3 at the same time.

A good use case for this example would be if a customer was utilising like for like copies of production for pre-production environments. In order to do the cloning efficiently a PowerCLI script is required. This article will guide you through the scripts required to automate the process of cloning, as well as removing this once a vApp is no longer required. The PowerCLI scripts can be plugged into various different configuration like tools such as Puppet or Chef and can also be integrated into orchestration tools such as Jenkins. Script to clone vApps You can find an example of the PowerCLI script to clone and remove a vApp on UKCloud's GitHub repository: https://github.com/ukcloud/knowledge_centre/tree/master/CloningvAPPsUsingPowerCLI The example script clones the specified vApp into an existing catalogue within the appropriate vDC. The script provides an option for deployment once it has been cloned. If you select this option, the vApp is deployed by the script. Stop and remove vApp using PowerCLI When a vApp has been used and is no longer required, there is a remove PowerCLI script that provides an automated way of removing the cloned environment. This script stops the vAPP and then deletes it from the catalogue specified. The scripts are executed using VMware vSphere PowerCLI. VMware vSphere PowerCLI is a command-line interface (CLI) tool for automating vSphere and vCloud management. You can download the tool from: https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/details?downloadGroup=PCLI600R3&productId=536 .

    "title": "Tier 1 storage | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Tier 1 storage Introduction UKCloud's block storage uses a blended mix of enterprise flash drives, SAS, and NL-SAS disks in RAID 5 and RAID 6 configurations. To achieve the right balance of performance and cost, we use automated storage tiering, where data is tiered according to access patterns. Frequently accessed data will reside on quick-access flash drives, while data that's accessed less frequently (catalogue images, for example) will reside on slower NL-SAS disks. The system evaluates data access over 24-hour periods and may reallocate data to ensure the best system efficiency. We recommend that customers try using the standard Tier 2 storage before deciding to migrate to Tier 1 storage. This is because the use of three tiers of media combined with an additional SSD caching layer, is still the most efficient way to store data for most applications for a couple of key reasons: Most application data ages - data that was once read or changed many times a day eventually becomes out of date or no longer relevant, so is no longer being read or changed. Automatic data tiering moves cold data from SAS or SSD into cost-efficient NL-SAS, not only freeing up space for hotter data on faster media, but also driving down the cost of storing the data. Some applications or parts of applications don't require the low latency that the faster media gives. Examples of this include user file systems or parts of multi-layer applications such as SharePoint. Following feedback from our customers and partners, UKCloud has identified that application latency or unpredictable performance can sometimes stem from the use of the standard three-tier pools for some applications. This happens when data relocation doesn't happen fast enough to adapt to the change in workload profiles. The figure below shows an ideal world compared with reality for data distribution across tiers. To address this issue UKCloud has developed Tier 1 storage to ensure that applications that require consistent or high write performance can achieve it. What is Tier 1 storage? Tier 1 storage sits on enterprise-class technology, so still benefits from the feature set available on the standard Tier 2 storage. However, there are a few subtle changes that increase the performance of workloads sitting on Tier 1 storage. By removing the NL-SAS layer and using a two-tier pool of performance media (SAS and SSD), the negative effect of tiering on the consistent performance of data is reduced. This is because even workloads that are accessed infrequently are serviced by faster spinning media (see the figure below). By increasing the ratio of SSD to SAS, we ensure that a higher proportion of customer data can sit on enterprise flash, rather than on spinning media. So workload IO is serviced a lot quicker. Placing all the drives in RAID 10 configurations rather than a blend of RAID 5 and RAID 6 improves response times of writes to storage under high load. Response times are improved because the storage processors need to do fewer RAID calculations to commit new writes to disk. During periods of high workload, this enables the cache to flush quicker, allowing more host write IOs to be serviced by the storage. Good candidate workloads for Tier 1 storage UKCloud has identified that Tier 1 storage is best for the following use cases. Applications that need consistent performance The nature of multi-tenant environments means that data can sometimes be pushed down to SAS/NL-SAS, even if it is hot. This is because other customers' application data may be hotter. Having a large pool of SSD and no NL-SAS will ensure that customer data has a more predictable performance for both reads and writes. Applications with a high write-to-read ratio (+50% w/r) Some applications will have a large amount of data creation or change, which will involve a lot of write IO to the storage. Using RAID 10 lowers the overhead of the RAID calculation, which reduces the latency of cache flushing to disk. High-performance applications High-performance applications are generally databases or virtual desktops, which require high read and write performance. Data warehousing There are two data warehousing use cases: Occasionally, data may be loaded onto the UKCloud platform but not accessed for a period of time; this data would normally be de-staged to NL-SAS. By not having NL SAS in the Tier 1 pool, the lowest tier will be SAS, which will still provide good performance of both reads and writes, even if the data has been cold for a long time. Alternatively, data can be stored in UKCloud's Cloud Storage and loaded into the Tier 1 storage platform when needed. This maintains high performance for active data without the associated cost of storing infrequently accessed data. Small block, random-write databases Data with a high volume of small random writes will benefit from the enhanced performance that comes from using RAID 10 as the underlying storage. As the graphs below show, the RAID 10 write performance is much better than RAID 5 and RAID 6 for small block writes. Large data sets The higher ratio of SSD to SAS means there's a higher chance that data within a given dataset will be in flash media, accelerating database performance. Unsuitable candidate workloads The following workloads would be considered unsuitable as they won't benefit from Tier 1 storage. Rich media Rich media such as images and audio won't benefit from enhanced write performance. Applications that don't need consistent performance Although not necessarily an unsuitable candidate, if a workload doesn't require consistent performance, there will be no real benefit in putting the data on Tier 1 storage. Low-performance applications Applications that don't need high performance aren't necessarily unsuitable candidates; they just won't see any real benefits from Tier 1 storage. Applications with a high read-to-write ratio (+50% r/w) Applications with a high read ratio don't really benefit from the added performance that Tier 1 storage provides. As the graph below shows, RAID10 doesn't show a real performance increase on reads compared to the other RAID configurations. Identifying good candidate workloads In most cases, you'll be able to judge which workloads are best suited for Tier 1 storage. However in some cases, you may need guidance on which storage a particular application requires. If your application isn't currently running on UKCloud's platform or on another environment, we would recommend building it on the standard Tier 2 storage pool initially. You can then assess its performance once it has been set up and is running under load, and decide whether the workload should be moved to Tier 1 storage. If the workload is currently running on any environment, it's possible to run a performance assessment on the application to understand its characteristics, enabling you to make an informed decision on where it is best placed. You would carry out the performance assessment yourself, supported by one of our Cloud Architects. Limitations Tier 1 workloads are available with the Essential, Power and Priority VM types. They're not available with Synchronous with Geo-resilient protection option, because the latency overhead of the synchronous replication would offset the Tier 1 storage benefits. Initially, moving a workload to and from the Tier 1 platform will be a manual process that may involve raising a service request via My Calls on the UKCloud Portal. Realistic performance expectations The performance that can be expected from the system will depend on many factors, such as the application's read/write ratio, and whether the IO will be random or sequential in nature. UKCloud's storage platforms are shared by all consumers within the boundary of the security domain. This means we can't provide a guaranteed minimum IOPs or throughput; however, the performance of individual data stores is actively monitored. We regularly review the data store usage metrics, and perform migrations of virtual machines to less populated data stores to alleviate contention.

    "keywords": "How to use the VMware OVF Tool Overview The VMware OVF Tool is a conversion program freely downloadable from VMware that assists in the distribution of virtual machines (VMs) and vApps, converting them between OVF, VMX and OVA formats. It also includes a command‑line facility to import and export OVF packages between environments or from third party suppliers. The OVF Tool is a command‑line interface (CLI) tool only. OVF (Open Virtualisation Format) is a packaging standard created by leading virtualisation vendors. It is a platform independent, efficient, open packaging and distribution format for virtual machines. VMX (the VM configuration file) is a simple text file with various parameters relating to the guest Virtual Machine. The OVA file extension is associated with Open Virtual Machine Format. Compared to the OVF file format, the OVA format contains all VM files and *.ovf files compressed into one single OVA archive file instead of many files in a folder. Downloading the OVF Tool You can download the OVF Tool via the following link: https://my.vmware.com/group/vmware/details?downloadGroup=OVFTOOL420&productId=491 You must have a VMware account to download the tool. You can download the OVF Tool for Windows 32-bit and 64-bit, Linux 32-bit and 64-bit, or Mac OS X. After downloading and installing the OVF Tool, you must then go to the directory in which you installed the tool to run it. There is no icon or program logo on your desktop for the OVF Tool, so to launch it, you must use the command prompt. Go to the installation folder and run: ovftool Getting started with the OVF Tool The OVF Tool is a CLI tool, so some level of familiarity with CMD commands helps in using the tool. There are a number of help commands, which are a good source of information: ovftool --help ovftool --help examples ovftool --help locators ovftool --help config You can also find the OVF Tool User Guide at: https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/ovf/ Basic import and export commands You'll mainly use the OVF Tool to import (deploy) and export VMs or appliances into and out of your UKCloud environment.

    "title": "How to create a vApp network | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to create a vApp network Overview In addition to virtual data centre (VDC) networking, you can create individual vApp networks to have even greater control over your network infrastructure. vApp networks enable you to create smaller networks within individual vApps that have a vApp edge, similar to the edge gateway on your VDC. Although a vApp edge isn't as feature rich as a VDC edge, it enables you to create firewall and NAT rules to separate your VDC networks from your vApp virtual machines (VMs). This means you can create some quite complex networks to satisfy application needs. The example of a vApp network, below, shows the vApp edge. Creating a vApp network There are two ways to create a vApp network within vCloud Director: During vApp creation After vApp creation Creating a vApp network during vApp creation Follow the steps for creating a new vApp as shown in How to create a vApp . When you get to the Configure Virtual Machines page, where you select the network you want your VMs to connect to, from the Network list, select Add Network . Tip The Add Network option is at the bottom of the Network list, so you may have to scroll down the list to find it. On the Network Specification page of the New vApp Network Wizard , fill out the fields as required for your network then click Next . Some options are pre-populated by default; you can change them if you want. On the General page, enter a Network name and Description , then click Next and Finish . Your newly created vApp network is now included in the Network list. Your newly created vApp network is now included in the Network list. If you want to connect multiple VMs within the vApp to the new vApp network, go through and make sure they will all connect to it. When you're done, click Next . On the Configure Networking page, to connect the vApp network to an external VDC network, from the Connection list, select the VDC network that you want to connect to. In the Routing column, select whether to apply NAT and Firewall rules to the vApp edge (you can always change this later), then click Next . On the Ready to Complete page, review your configuration, then click Finish to deploy the vApp. Creating a vApp network after vApp creation If you've created a vApp that is connected to a VDC network, and now you want to convert it to a vApp with an internal network: On the My Cloud tab, double-click the vApp to open it. As you're going to be changing network settings, all VMs within the vApp must be powered off, so, if necessary, on the Virtual Machines tab, right-click each VM and select Power Off . Select the Networking tab. Click the green + icon to add a new network. On the Network Type page of the New vApp Network Wizard , select vApp network then click Next . On the Network Specification page of the New vApp Network Wizard , fill out the fields as required for your network then click Next . Some options are pre-populated by default; you can change them if you want. On the General page, enter a Network name and Description , then click Next and Finish . Your newly created vApp network is now included in the Network list. To connect the vApp network to an external VDC network, from the Connection list, select the VDC network that you want to connect to. In the Routing column, select whether to apply NAT and Firewall rules to the vApp edge (you can always change this later), then click Next . When you're done, click Apply at the bottom of the page. If your vApp is already populated with VMs that are connected to a VDC network, you may want to move them over to the vApp network. To change the network a VM connects to, on the vApp Diagram tab, right-click the VM and select Properties . In the Virtual Machine Properties dialog box, select the Hardware tab. In the NICs section, from the Networks list, select the vApp network to connect the VM to. If you want to dual-home your VM, click the Add button to add a second network. When you're done, click OK . You can go back to the VM properties to see the new IP address assigned to the VM. Viewing and adjusting vApp network settings When you've created your vApp network and assigned VMs to it, you may want to review the vApp network settings and adjust them if needed. On the My Cloud tab, open the vApp you want to work with then select the Networking tab. Right-click the vApp network and select Configure Services . You can now view the default network services and change them if necessary. Enabling DHCP DHCP isn't enabled by default. To enable it, on the DHCP page of the Configure Services dialog box, select the Enable DHCP check box, enter appropriate information then click OK . For more information about DHCP, see How to create a DHCP pool . Creating firewall rules There will be a rule in place to allow any traffic to traverse the firewall. You can amend or delete this rule, or create new rules. On the Firewall page of the Configure Services dialog box, select the rule you want to edit, then click Edit For more about firewall rules, see How to create firewall rules . Creating NAT rules NAT rules, enabled by default, enable mapping between internal VM interfaces and external IP addresses. To edit the mapping rules for a VM: On the NAT page of the Configure Services dialog box, select the rule you want to edit and click Edit . In the Edit IP Translation Rule dialog box, select the VM interface for which you want to edit the NAT rule. From the Mapping Mode list, select the mapping mode. The default mapping is Automatic . You can change this to Manual , in which case, enter an External IP address to which the VM can map. When you're done, click OK . The external IP address will be on the same subnet as the VDC network that connects to the vApp Edge. For more information about NAT rules, see How to create NAT rules . Creating static routes Static routing at the vApp network level allows traffic to route between different vApp networks, across the VDC networks. The prerequisites for static routing are as follows: Static routing must be enabled for the VDC network you're connecting to (see How to create a static route ). The two vApp networks must be routed to the same VDC network. The vApp networks must be in vApps that have been started at least once. To add a static route: On the Static Routing page of the Configure Services dialog box, click Add In the Add Static Route dialog box, enter a Name for the static route.

It is done when the VMs within the vApp sit on the VDC network, rather than on their own vApp network. To apply vApp fencing during vApp creation, select the Fence vApp check box on the Configure Networking page of the New vApp wizard. If you're converting a vApp after creation, on the My Cloud tab, open the vApp you want to fence, then, on the Networking tab, select the Fence vApp checkbox. Make sure you click Apply when you're done to save any changes. Feedback If you have any comments on this document or any other aspect of your UKCloud experience, send them to products@ukcloud.com ."

This guide explains how to access the Ubuntu repository servers to receive updates. Depending on whether your VM is on UKCloud's Assured OFFICIAL or Elevated OFFICIAL platform, there's a different process to follow. Before you attempt to establish connections to an Ubuntu repository server, you need to make sure your VMs can communicate with the Ubuntu server which exists outside of your cloud organisation. This may involve editing the NAT and firewall settings within your edge gateway to allow traffic to traverse into your virtual data centre (VDC). For how to do this, see the How to create NAT rules and How to create firewall rules . Assured OFFICIAL platform UKCloud's Assured OFFICIAL platform is internet facing, so you can simply configure your VM to connect to the internet, and use standard update tools such as apt-get to talk directly to the publicly available Ubuntu repositories. Elevated OFFICIAL platform UKCloud's Elevated OFFICIAL platform doesn't natively connect to the internet, and the PSN Protected network doesn't have any Ubuntu repository servers. To connect to an Ubuntu repository server for updates, you can use UKCloud-managed repository servers or a UKCloud Walled Garden. UKCloud-managed repository servers We provide Ubuntu repositories for the 12.04 and 14.04 LTS versions of Ubuntu on our Elevated OFFICIAL platform, so that customers with Ubuntu VMs can get software updates. To do this, issue the appropriate command for your release of Ubuntu to download a repository list file to your apt sources directory. For 12.04: sudo wget -P /etc/apt/sources.list.d http://x.y.89.96/repos/ukcloud_precise.list For 14.04: sudo wget -P /etc/apt/sources.list.d http://x.y.89.96/repos/ukcloud_trusty.list We also recommend that you rename the default /etc/apt/sources.list file to reduce the likelihood of errors during the update process that stem from attempts to access the internet-based Canonical Partner repositories. To do this, use the following command: sudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.old Replace x.y with the first two octets of the Elevated OFFICIAL public IP addresses. If you're not sure what these are, contact UKCloud Support. Walled Garden Choose this option only if you want full control of Ubuntu updates and are already thinking of deploying a UKCloud Walled Garden. This option involves pulling updates into the Assured platform, and using UKCloud's Walled Garden to move them to the Elevated platform. It's a much more complex solution than using UKCloud-managed repository servers, and you have sole responsibility for deploying and managing it.

By configuring a new network or IP address within your virtual data centre (VDC) and deploying a collector with the syslog IP address, you can access your edge gateway syslog data. You can then use this data to check: Allowed and denied network traffic Load balancer statistics Load balancer health This guide explains the network configuration required to provision a syslog collector within your VDC to receive syslog information direct from your edge gateway. Collecting syslog data for a single edge gateway The simplest scenario is to gather syslog data from a single edge gateway into one collector. To do this you need to create a routable location for the syslog IP address, by either: Adding the syslog IP address to an existing network interface card (NIC) on a routed subnet Add the syslog IP address to a subnet on the routed network. For example, if your existing monitoring server has a NIC on eth0 (for example, 10.0.1.10 ), on routed Org VDC network 10.0.1.0/24 , you'd add the syslog IP address to eth0 . Add a route on the vCNS Edge that routes the syslog IP address via the subnet. For example, route 100.127.255.250 MASK 255.255.255.255 via 10.0.1.10 . Configure the software on your existing monitoring server to capture data from the IP address of the vCNS edge. Note The steps to achieve this depend on your operating system and chosen syslog server. Configuring a new routed network Create a new routed network with the following details: Org Network Name: Customer defined Gateway: 100.127.255.249 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.248 DNS: Customer defined Static IP Pool: 100.127.255.250 -- 100.127.255.254 You can find more detailed steps for creating a routed network in How to create a routed VDC network . Deploy a new syslog server connected to the new routed network with a static address of 100.127.255.250 and install and configure the syslog server's edge gateway. Note The steps to achieve this depend on your operating system and chosen syslog server. Collecting syslog data for multiple edge gateways If you have multiple edge gateways under a single NFT you can gather the data from all those edges into the same syslog collector. Set up a single syslog collector for one of your vCNS Edges as described in the previous section. Note We'll refer to this edge gateway as the syslog edge and all the other edge gateways as source edges . Confirm that you can see the local syslog traffic from the local syslog edge. Create a firewall rule on the syslog edge to allow syslog traffic from the source edges' TRANSIT IPs ( 172.26. x . x in Assured or 172.26. LOWER OCTET . x in Elevated) through to the syslog server IP. You can create individual rules using the following suggestions: <SOURCE TRANSIT IP>:Any to 100.127.255.250 on UDP Any:Any to 100.127.255.250:514 on UDP <NFT TRANSIT CIDR/SUBNET>:Any to 100.127.255.250:514 on UDP On each of the source edges, create a static route to direct traffic to the syslog edge. Use the following settings: Applied On: <nft_network> Name: Syslog traffic (or any other name you prefer) Network: 100.127.255.248/29 Next Hop IP: The TRANSIT IP address of the syslog edge Syslog packets from each source edge will now be forwarded to the syslog edge, with the source of the syslog traffic being the TRANSIT IP of the source edge. Perform a packet capture on the syslog collector to confirm it's receiving packets from the source edges. Note You may have to enable or disable logging on firewall rules to trigger syslog traffic. When you've confirmed that your syslog collector is receiving the syslog data, configure your syslog server to capture packets from the new syslog source. Enabling logging After setting up your syslog collector, you need to make sure that your edge gateway sends network traffic to the log. Edit your vCNS Edge firewall settings to log firewall rules: You must log each rule individually by selecting the Log network traffic for firewall rule option: To log data for actions not covered by individual rules, select the Log option next to the Default action setting: You can find more detailed steps for editing firewall settings in How to create firewall rules .

    "keywords": "How to access CentOS Update servers Introduction Each of the two security levels within the UKCloud cloud presents its own challenges regarding licensing CentOS machines. This document explains how to access the CentOS repository servers to receive updates. Before you attempt to establish a connection to the CentOS repo servers, you need to make sure your VMs can communicate with the CentOS server which exists outside of your cloud organisation. This may involve editing your NAT and firewall settings within your edge gateway to allow traffic to traverse into your virtual data centre (vDC). For how to do this, see the How to create NAT rules and How to create firewall rules . Assured OFFICIAL platform UKCloud's Assured OFFICIAL platform is internet facing, so you need to configure your VM to connect to the internet, and use a standard update tool, such as Spacewalk RHN, to get updates for CentOS. Elevated OFFICIAL platform Our Elevated OFFICIAL platform doesn't natively connect to the internet, and the PSN Protected network doesn't have any CentOS repo servers. To receive CentOS updates, you can use UKCloud-managed repository servers or a Walled Garden. Both options are described below. Option 1. UKCloud-managed repository servers We provide repositories for CentOS 6 on our Elevated OFFICIAL platform. To access them: Create a file called il3-repos.repo in /etc/yum.repos.d, and populate it with the following: ``` [base] name=UKCloud CentOS Repository - Base baseurl=http://x.y.89.96/centos/6.5/os/x86_64 gpgcheck=1 gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-6 [updates] name=UKCloud CentOS Repository - Updates baseurl=http://x.y.89.89.96/centos/centos-updates gpgcheck=1 gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-6 [extras] name=UKCloud CentOS Repository - Extras baseurl=http://x.y.89.96/centos/centos-extras gpgcheck=1 gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-6 ``` Or use the following command to download the repo file directly from the server: ``` wget -P /etc/yum.repos.d http://x.y.89.96/repos/ukcloud_centos6.repo ``` In the above string, replace x.y with the first two octets of the Elevated OFFICIAL public IP addresses. If you're not sure what these are, contact UKCloud Support. Remove all other *.repo files in this directory. Option 2. Walled Garden Choose this option only if you want full control of CentOS updates and are already thinking of deploying a Walled Garden. This option involves pulling updates into the Assured platform, then using UKCloud's Walled Garden to move them to the Elevated platform. It's a much more complex solution than using UKCloud-managed repository servers, and you have sole responsibility for deploying and managing it.

It will help you to get started using UKCloud for VMware. The Getting Started Guide provides an overview of UKCloud for VMware and gives you basic information about how to log in and set up your environment. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have access to the UKCloud Portal and vCloud Director. To build compute services and virtual data centres (VDCs) you must be a vCloud Director administrator. Before you begin You should have received your UKCloud Portal login credentials from your Customer Success Manager (CSM). We recommend that you use the Mozilla Firefox ESR 32-bit browser as this is supported by both the UKCloud Portal and by the Web Console for the version of vCloud Director used by UKCloud for VMware. More information! Browser requirements for services on the UKCloud Platform Introductions to UKCloud for VMware We understand that each enterprise application has its own set of technical and service requirements that must be addressed on an individual basis. UKCloud for VMware is highly configurable, and gives you the flexibility to use different service levels, VM sizes, security domains, connectivity and data protection options. You can build completely tailored solutions by mixing and matching service options. The choice doesn't lock you to one service or size and you can always change it later. Services within UKCloud belong to an account, which in turn belongs to a company. A company can own multiple accounts. You can use accounts to create separate environments for different projects or, in the case of UKCloud partners, to create separate environments for different customers. Within an account you can have multiple UKCloud services, one of which could be UKCloud for VMware. You can have multiple instances of a service within an account. Logging in to the UKCloud Portal The first thing you need to do to get started with UKCloud for VMware is to log in to the UKCloud Portal. Go to the appropriate URL, depending on the security domain in which your service is located: Assured OFFICIAL: https://portal.ukcloud.com Elevated OFFICIAL: https://portal.ukcloud.gsi.gov.uk On the Log in page, enter your credentials and click Sign in . Tip If you've forgotten your password, click the Forgotten password? link to request a password reset. If this is the first time you've logged in, use the temporary password you were given by your Portal administrator or CSM. You'll be prompted to change this temporary password. If your Portal administrator has enabled memorable word authentication or Google Two Factor Authentication (2FA), you'll be prompted for the second step of your authentication process. For example, for memorable word authentication, you'll be prompted to enter three randomly‑selected letters from your memorable word. (If this is the first time you've logged in, you'll be prompted to create a memorable word.) For more information about the UKCloud Portal and all the functionality it provides, see the Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal . Creating your UKCloud for VMware estate When you first access UKCloud for VMware, you'll need to create a compute service (sometimes called a vOrg) to act as a top-level container for your cloud resources. As your estate grows, you can add more compute services to logically organise your resources. Within your compute service, you create VDCs to contain your VMs. VMs in the same VDC share workload characteristics and have access to the same resources, such as networking infrastructure, storage and external connectivity. We recommend that you organise related VMs within vApps to make your applications easier to manage. For example, you can start all the VMs within a vApp with a single operation, rather than having to start up each VM separately. vApps are also useful to help maintain crash‑consistency within an application in the event of a disaster. Building a compute service If you have the appropriate permissions, you can use the Portal to create a compute service in your account, without having to raise a support ticket. In the UKCloud Portal, select the account in which you want to create the compute service. In the navigation panel, expand Tools and then select Create Compute Service . On the Build Compute Service page, from the Zone radio buttons, select the zone in which you want to create the new compute service. Note In the Portal, you can create compute services only in zones in regions 5 and 6. Enter a Compute Service Name . Tip The name can be up to 32 characters long and can include any character except +. Click Build . The Build Compute Service Status page displays information about the compute service you're building and lets you know how the build is progressing. Tip You can stay on this page until the build is finished, or you can leave this page and check the status of the build later by going to the VMware Cloud Build History report. When the build is complete, the page displays either a success or fail message. If the build is successful, you can start building VDCs in your compute service (see Building a virtual data centre ). If the build is unsuccessful, raise a support ticket (quoting the Build ID ) to resolve any issues. Building a virtual data centre After creating your compute service, the next step is to create one or more VDCs. Note You can build VDCs in any of your compute services in regions 5 and 6, including those created by support tickets or the Portal API, not just those you created using the Portal. In the Portal navigation panel, expand VMware Cloud and then select the compute service in which you want to create the VDC. Note To create a VDC using the Portal, the compute service must be in region 5 or 6. From the Actions menu, select Build VDC . Note If this option is greyed out, either you do not have the appropriate permissions or your compute service is not in region 5 or 6. On the Build VDC page, from the VM Type radio buttons, select the option that describes the characteristics of the workload of the VDC: ESSENTIAL ---For lower priority workloads, such as temporary applications, data processing or system modelling tasks. VMs in the VDC can have contended compute resource allocation (CPU/RAM) and automated rebalancing is enabled to ensure the workload receives the requested performance. POWER ---For key workloads that are resource intensive, such as web and application workloads, mid-sized databases and caching services. VMs in the VDC have an uncontended compute resource allocation and automated rebalancing is enabled to pre-emptively optimise performance and availability. PRIORITY ---For critical workloads that handle important business processes that benefit from a steady state of operation. VMs in the VDC have an uncontended compute resource allocation and automated rebalancing is configured to reduce workload movement around the platform. Enter a VDC Name . Tip The name can be up to 32 characters long and can include any character except +. Click Build . The VDC Build Status page displays information about the VDC you're building and lets you know how the build is progressing. Tip You can stay on this page until the build is finished, or you can leave this page and check the status of the build later by going to the VMware Cloud Build History report. When the build is complete, the page displays either a success or fail message. If the build is successful, you can start building VMs. To provide external access to the VDC, you'll need to create an edge gateway (see How to build an edge gateway using the UKCloud Portal ). If the build is unsuccessful, raise a support ticket (quoting the Build ID ) to resolve any issues. Logging in to vCloud Director After you've created your compute service and VDC, you can start to build up your applications. To do this, you must log in to vCloud Director, which you can access from the UKCloud Portal. In the Portal navigation panel expand VMware Cloud then select your compute service. On the vCloud Director tab, for additional security, re-enter your UKCloud Portal password, then click Confirm . vCloud Director launches in your browser window. Note If this is the first time you've opened vCloud Director, you may be requested to download the vCloud Director Web Console plugin. Tip If you encounter any issues, make sure you're using the Firefox ESR 32-bit browser. For more information, see Browser requirements for services on the UKCloud Platform . The tasks you can perform in vCloud Director will depend on the permissions you have been granted. More information!

    "keywords": "Private Cloud for Storage FAQs Service What is the service? Private Cloud for Storage provides single-tenant storage Infrastructure as a Service. Your data is hosted in one of our UK data centres; or in your Crown Hosting Data Centre (CHDC). How does Private Cloud for Storage differ from UKCloud's Cloud Storage? The Platform Only package in Private Cloud for Storage provides you with the underlying Assured Cloud platform to host and manage dedicated storage hardware. You can arrange your own purchase of it, or UKCloud can broker it for you. This service differs from Cloud Storage in that it allows you to purchase in bulk up front, to reduce the price per GiB. What backup/disaster recovery options do I get? You can choose between two protection levels: STANDARD provides protection in one data centre ENHANCED provides remote protection in our second data centre Where will my data be physically stored? Your data will be stored in our highly resilient, UK-sovereign tier 3 data centres, which are separated by over 100km. How much data can I store? A core benefit of Private Cloud for Storage is that it can scale to meet the most demanding storage requirements. What network protocols are supported on the platform? There is native support for a wide variety of network protocols including SMB/CIFS, NFS, HTTP and, optionally, HDFS. Management How do I access the platform? Documentation on ways to interact with the platform is available from the UKCloud Portal Knowledge Centre. What software tools are available? Advanced software features for Private Cloud for Storage include auto-tiering, deduplication, retention, replication, quotas and snapshots. Support How do I raise a support ticket? UKCloud's secure online Portal provides the most common service management functionality. Alternatively, you can contact support by phone or email. How do I manage my services? Private Cloud for Storage on the Assured OFFICIAL (formerly IL2) domain can be managed over the internet (or other connectivity) by raising a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. For the Elevated OFFICIAL (formerly IL3) domain, the security requirements are much stricter and require either a PSN-approved connection, UKCloud Secure Remote Access, or CAPS-approved encryption. What are your service maintenance windows? As far as possible, planned maintenance of UKCloud's infrastructure takes place between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Sunday, or between the hours of 08:00 and 12:00 (UK local time) on a Saturday or Sunday. We provide customers with at least 14 days' advance notice of planned maintenance. As far as possible, emergency maintenance of UKCloud's infrastructure takes place between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Sunday, or between the hours of 08:00 and 12:00 (UK local time) on Saturday or Sunday, unless there is an identified and demonstrable immediate risk to a customer's environment. Whenever possible, we provide customers with at least six hours' advance notice of emergency maintenance. Onboarding How can I get started with the service? On acceptance of your order, we'll work with you to create a detailed design for your Private Cloud for Storage service. The design will formalise the dedicated components required for the solution, including storage hardware, storage software, network hardware and cables. If this is a new service for you, we will create your primary administrator account and send you a welcome pack, which includes the URL for the UKCloud Portal for access to the Knowledge Centre and service management function. Billing and legal What is the smallest unit of time I will be billed for? Billing depends on the packaging option chosen. The smallest unit of time you will be billed for this service is monthly. Private Cloud for Storage is offered under a 24-month minimum term commitment. How can I pay for the services? Service charges are billed monthly in arrears. In addition, there will be initial upfront charges, which vary depending on the pricing model selected. Payment can be made by direct bank transfer (BACS/CHAPS). How can I view billing information? Billing information is available via the UKCloud Portal. What are the termination fees? An early exit charge will be payable if the contract is terminated before the end of its original term. You are responsible for extracting their data from the platform if required. UKCloud may make an additional charge for transferring data out of the service. Is there a free trial? Owing to the dedicated, single-tenant nature of this service, no trials are available. Security What data is suitable for your cloud? This service is hosted in the UK and operated by SC-cleared staff. It has extensive independent validation (including CESG design reviews) that it is fully aligned with the 14 NCSC Cloud Security Principles, and is therefore ideal for all data classified at OFFICIAL (including OFFICIAL SENSITIVE) and legacy IL0--IL4 solutions. Can systems on different UKCloud platforms communicate with one another? UKCloud's Cross Domain Security Zone allows you to use the UKCloud-defined and managed UKCloud Guard, or a customer-designed and managed Walled Garden, to enable communication between platforms.

    "title": "Getting Started Guide for Journaling Protection | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for Journaling Protection Overview Journaling Protection is a powerful, self-service replication and recovery tool that can help you improve your organisational resilience. By adopting UKCloud's Journaling Protection solution, you can protect your UKCloud for VMware applications by replicating them to another UKCloud for VMware‑enabled zone. This ensures that you can meet your disaster recovery requirements --- including any aggressive recovery point or recovery time objectives. Our Journaling Protection solution is powered by Zerto, a leading provider of disaster recovery software for the cloud. This guide covers the tasks you need to perform to get Journaling Protection up and running in your environment. Intended audience This guide is intended for any user who needs to create and manage Journaling Protection for UKCloud for VMware. To complete the steps in this guide you need to have access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal. Introduction to Journaling Protection You can protect your VMs by adding Journaling Protection to the vApp that contains those VMs. When you add Journaling Protection to a vApp, if a VM in that vApp is compromised, for example by a virus attack or bad software update, you can quickly recover the VM to a point in time before that attack or update took place. You enable Journaling Protection by adding the vApp to a virtual protection group (VPG). Each VM in the protected vApp is synchronised to the recovery site and a journal is created. After this initial synchronisation, each subsequent write operation to the VM is processed as normal on the source site and a copy is asynchronously sent to the recovery site and written to the journal. Each journal entry exists in the journal for a specified number of days (the journal history). When the journal history is reached, as new journal entries are created, older entries are written to the recovery VM's virtual disks. Every few seconds, a checkpoint is written to every journal for each VM in the VPG to ensure crash-consistency between the VMs. If you need to recover a VM, you select a checkpoint to recover to. For example, in the case of a virus, you could recover to a checkpoint from before the attack. During recovery, the vApp and its VMs are created on the recovery site and the recovery disks for each VM are attached to the recovered VM. Information in the journal is then promoted to the VM to bring it up to the date and time of the selected checkpoint. Two terms you may hear in connection with Journaling Protection are recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO). The RPO indicates the amount of data you can afford to lose in the event of an outage. For example, if your application data changes fairly infrequently, your RPO can be higher as the data remains fairly static. However, if your application data is constantly changing, you'll need your RPO to be smaller to avoid significant loss of data in the event of an outage. The RTO is the amount of time you can tolerate your application being unavailable in the event of an outage. For example, if your application provides critical functionality, you'll need to bring it back online very quickly. However, for a less critical application, you may be able to tolerate a longer outage. Because of the use of regular checkpoints (every few seconds), our Zerto‑powered Journaling Protection option provides a minimal RPO. The ability to use recovered VMs even before all the journal data has been promoted provides a good RTO as well. Before you begin When you request Journaling Protection for your VMs, UKCloud provides you with: A ZORG ID to identify your environment within Zerto Access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal (ZSSP), where you can create and manage your VPGs You should consider the following: Journaling Protection is provided on a vApp basis (not for individual VMs). When designing your application, you should use vApps to group related VMs together to ensure crash consistency between VMs in the event of a failover. VMs must be powered on to be synchronised. The operating system used by the protected VMs must also be supported in the recovery site. Our Journaling Protection service option captures every action. When a VM is deleted from your vApp, the associated journal is also deleted. If you want to keep historic records of VMs that are no longer running on the platform, consider UKCloud's Snapshot Protection service option. We provide a single default service profile. The details of this are available in the Journaling Protection Service Scope . We do not currently provide the option for you to create custom profiles. Getting Journaling Protection up and running To get Journaling Protection up and running for your VMs, follow the steps below: Create a recovery VDC Configure networking on the recovery site Create a virtual protection group Perform a test failover Create a recovery VDC To recover your VMs to a different UKCloud site, you must have a VDC in the intended recovery site. If you already have a compute service in the recovery site, you can use an existing VDC or you can create a new one using: The UKCloud Portal (for more information see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware ) The UKCloud Portal API (for more information see the How to use the UKCloud Portal API ) If you don't already have a compute service in the recovery site or you'd prefer UKCloud to create the VDC for you, you can request this as part of your Journaling Protection Service Request. Configure networking on the recovery site You must configure any internally and externally routed networks in your recovery site to duplicate those in the source site. You must also configure the edge gateway with the same firewall, NAT and other rules. You'll create the mapping between these networks when you create your VPG (see How to create a virtual protection group ). In the event of a failover, external access to the recovery site will be via a different IP address. You'll need to account for any required DNS changes and external connectivity configuration (such as VPNs), to ensure continued external access. Utilising UKCloud's VMware cloud, you can configure this in advance. Alternatively, you can use load balancing technologies to manage a seamless switch between environments. You do not need to configure vApp networks in advance as they will be replicated within the VPG. Create a virtual protection group A virtual protection group (VPG) is a collection of VMs that are grouped together for protection purposes. The UKCloud Journaling Protection service option protects VMs on a vApp basis. When you create a VPG, you specify the vApp to protect and all the VMs in that vApp are protected. For example, in a standard three-tier application, you will likely have three VMs: one for your application, one for the database and one for the web server. As best practice, you should create these three related VMs in a single vApp, which you can then add to a VPG so that all the VMs are replicated (and recovered) together. For more information, see How to create a virtual protection group . Perform a test failover After you create your VPG, we recommend that you perform a test failover to confirm that your VMs will be recovered correctly in the event of a live failover. You should also run test failovers periodically to ensure that your VMs can still be recovered successfully. For more information, see How to perform a failover . Next steps You have now performed all the steps needed to set up Journaling Protection for your VMs. If you experience a disaster, such as a virus attack, you can perform a live failover to recover your VMs to a specific point in time before the disaster occurred and continue operation as usual. For more information, see How to perform a failover . Glossary This glossary provides definitions of terms specific to Journaling Protection. failover When an application switches to an alternative environment in order to ensure continued operation. journal A repository of write operations performed on a protected VM after the initial synchronisation. source site The UKCloud site where your live VMs are located. recovery point objective (RPO) The amount of data you can afford to lose in the event of an outage. recovery site The UKCloud site to which your VMs are replicated for protection.

This document outlines the browser requirement for UKCloud services. UKCloud for VMware For UKCloud for VMware, we recommend that you use the Mozilla Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR 52) 32-bit browser. This browser is supported by both the UKCloud Portal and by the Web Console for vCloud Director 8.20 (the version used by UKCloud for VMware). Firefox ESR 52 is an older version of Firefox, updated with new security patches, that remains compatible with the plugin type that the vCloud Director Web Console uses on our platform. You can find Firefox ESR at: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/ Note Make sure you download ESR 52, which is the last ESR release to support legacy add-ons. Support for ESR 52 ends in August 2018, but by this time we will have upgraded UKCloud for VMware to vCloud Director 9.1, which will eliminate the need for the Web Console plugin. For more information, see https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2017/10/03/legacy-add-on-support-on-firefox-esr/ . You should also make sure that you download the 32-bit version of the browser.

    "title": "UKCloud for Oracle Software Service Scope | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "UKCloud for Oracle Software About this document This document describes the boundaries of the UKCloud for Oracle software service, along with the division of responsibilities between UKCloud and the customer, to facilitate the provisioning and ongoing use of the service. About UKCloud for Oracle Software The UKCloud for Oracle Software service provides a secure, scalable and cost-effective platform for hosting Oracle virtual machines (OVMs) of various sizes. You can use the platform to build new services quickly and securely; and migrate, augment or transform existing Oracle-based applications. The platform is immediately available so you can provision and scale OVMs in minutes. Service architecture Your UKCloud service architecture is as follows: Company. Your contract with UKCloud is associated with a company, which provides a single owner for the contract, regardless of how many accounts are created. Account. We use accounts to separate financial ownership. An account could represent an organisation, a customer contract, or a specific project. An account can also have several UKCloud services associated with it, such as UKCloud for Oracle, Cloud Storage and UKCloud for OpenStack. You can also use accounts to separate users based on access requirements or permissions. Organisation. This represents your UKCloud for Oracle Software service inside Oracle Enterprise Manager and on the UKCloud Portal. There is a 1:1 mapping of service to Organisation. Oracle Tenant. An Oracle Tenant is where you define your workload type and build your OVMs. You can create Oracle Tenants via a service request. Service configuration The UKCloud for Oracle Software infrastructure is uncontended and configured to optimise the performance and availability of Oracle workloads. There is only one service configuration on the UKCloud for Oracle Software platform, ensuring that OVMs are pinned to cores to stop OVM movement that would unbalance applications. Customers can self-configure OVMs by the number of cores, and amount of memory and storage needed. OVMs can be reconfigured to adjust resources in line with changing performance requirements. Self-service management is done through the Oracle Enterprise Management Portal, accessed through the UKCloud Portal. Full details of the available service options are outlined in the Service Definition ( Assured | Elevated ). Storage options All storage is persistent and resilient to local hardware failures. Multiple storage options can be used to support different aspects of the application. Tier 1. Fast storage ideal for data warehouses, fast transactional databases or randomly executing workloads. Tier 2. General all-purpose storage, suitable for systems with human interactions or predictable work patterns. Cloud Storage. Ideal for serving media content or as a medium-term repository; can be used to store Recovery Manager (RMAN) backups. Storage policies We provide you with access to two storage policies: tier 1 and tier 2. We will initially provide you with a tier 2 storage policy, however you can request tier 1 storage be added to your Oracle Tenant so you can create additional disks with tier 1 storage on your OVMs. VM templates come with a 50GiB system disk and a secondary disk (equivalent to the size of the RAM associated with the OVM - up to 16GiB). These virtual disks are mapped from the tier 2 VM repository by default. For installations of Oracle apps on top of the OS, it's best to have separate non-OS virtual disks which are then mapped to mountpoints. The sizing requirements/recommendations for the non-OS storage can be found on the official Oracle installation guides and they can differ from version to version. You'll need to take into consideration future data growth while planning capacity, as this would also reflect on the capacity required for backups. We do not guarantee storage performance, as it can be affected by many factors. We do not provide IOPS figures for our storage offerings. Workloads can use multiple storage profiles. Protection UKCloud for Oracle Software does not include any infrastructure-level backup or disaster recovery functionality. However, the underpinning infrastructure supports native Oracle protection technologies such as Data Guard and RMAN. UKCloud's Cloud Storage can be used as an S3-addressable target for Oracle protection technologies. Service availability UKCloud for Oracle Software offers an SLA guarantee of 99.95% availability. You are entitled to claim Service Credits for outages to services that take you out of the SLA. For more about how we calculate SLAs, see the SLA Definition document. Our SLA does not cover faults within your control, such as client application issues, or faults within external connectivity providers (for example, internet, PSN or N3/HSCN). Service background UKCloud for Oracle Software is underpinned by Oracle compute infrastructure. UKCloud manage the physical infrastructure and utilise our partner, Infomentum, to provide support and management from the hypervisor level and above. Infomentum will provision your Oracle Tenant environment and UKCloud will present it to you through the Oracle Enterprise Manager. You will be responsible for OVM creation and maintenance. All service requests will be triaged by UKCloud. We reserve the right to escalate a request to Infomentum for support. If you have not have a managed service contract with Infomentum, please do not contact them directly. UKCloud actively capacity-manages the cloud platform to ensure you have access to the resources you request. The UKCloud platform is designed using sites, regions and zones. The relationship between them is shown below: You can specify Farnborough or Corsham as the site where you would like to have your service provisioned, and we will try to accommodate requests and will advise you if we are unable do so. We control the deployed versions of technology on the platform. This covers internal platform-supporting technologies, and any technology versions available to you. Internally this includes, but isn't limited to, the Oracle Virtual Machine Manager and Oracle Virtual Machine Server versions, and the hardware version of the platform. Externally this includes the available versions of the edge gateway and Oracle Enterprise Manager. You can make additional configurations inside an OVM (such as implementing third-party software technologies). We do not support customer implementations inside a VM. Operating systems UKCloud for Oracle Software includes the base OVM platform licences, which provide VM containers that meet Oracle's definition of hard partitioning. Our service does not include licences for the Oracle applications and databases you choose to run. As the underlying platform is powered by OVM technology, you can either transfer your existing licences, or purchase new licences based on the quantity of virtual processors (cores) you allocate within each VM. Please note that UKCloud does not have the functionality to provide Oracle licensing, and this must be sourced via an appropriate partner. 'Cores' refers to OVM vCPUs pinned to physical processor cores (excluding hyper-threading). Your Oracle licensing will be based on the cores consumed by your OVM. Update services. We make update repositories available for OVM containers. We don't provide software update facilities for non-UKCloud licensed software, including all Oracle applications. Anti-virus. We do not provide anti-virus software as part of the service. Networks Internet-facing solutions. You are provided with 2 usable public IP addresses, but you can ask for additional public IP addresses via a Service Request. We reserve the right to decline the request if you have spare capacity in your existing deployment. PSN-facing solutions. You should raise a Service Request or contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM) to be assigned your IP address. This solution also comes with contended bandwidth (uncapped). Janet and N3/HSCN solutions. You have one usable IP address, but you can request additional IP addresses via a Service Request. UKCloud for Oracle Software does not have a native external connectivity functionality. Therefore, UKCloud have enabled customers to manage connectivity rules, such as firewall, IPsec VPN and NAT functionality, through a VMware edge gateway. This edge is provisioned within the UKCloud for VMware environment and is managed using either the UKCloud Portal GUI or API. This edge can be an existing edge in a customer's UKCloud for VMware environment, or can be provisioned as a completely new entity, specific for Oracle. Edge gateway By default, we assign one edge gateway per connectivity type. You can choose which external network you would like to enable your Oracle environment to connect to. Note that the Oracle environment does not have to connect to an external network, however an external network will need to be connected to the edge. Site-to-site IPsec VPN. You can create IPsec VPN tunnels to connect different environments, both internal and external, to UKCloud. There is a limit of 64 tunnels per edge gateway. Bring Your Own Firewall Bring Your Own Firewall is currently not available for UKCloud for Oracle Software installations; however, you can have BYOF within UKCloud for VMware and connect it to the UKCloud for Oracle Software edge gateway via an IPsec VPN. Protective monitoring We have implemented GPG 13-aligned Protective Monitoring across the Assured and Elevated platforms at the hypervisor level and below. We don't provide Protective Monitoring services above the hypervisor (for example, for your VM). Components above this infrastructure are your own responsibility to provide an appropriate protective monitoring capability. In line with UKCloud's System Interconnect and Security Policy (SISP), we provide notification of customer-impacting security incidents. It is your responsibility to report similar incidents to us. Platform management Users can access, manage and view the UKCloud for Oracle Software service, accessing only those features allowed by their role, in any of the following ways: Oracle Enterprise Manager. The graphical interface for the creation and management of the Oracle environment. vCloud Director API. Enables the programmatic creation and management of the Oracle edge gateway. vCloud Director graphical UI. Provides a graphical interface to access the vCloud Director environment to manage the Oracle edge gateway (depending on assigned permissions). UKCloud Portal. Enables the creation of Oracle compute services and edge gateways. The Portal also includes an overview of actual and estimated spend, along with service configuration information. Access to service reporting and incident and request management is also possible through the Portal. You cannot access the underlying infrastructure. This includes (but isn't limited to) the hardware and the Oracle Virtual Machine Manager environment. Service migration UKCloud do not currently provide migration services, however customers are free to bring their own migration tools and utilise them within the UKCloud for Oracle Software environment. Service reporting Visibility. We provide a monthly service report via the UKCloud Portal. This includes a summary of platform availability and a retrospective of the interactions with UKCloud support during the previous month. Maintenance notifications and Service Status reports are also delivered through the portal. Service reporting. All service reporting is done via the UKCloud Portal. Billing. Billing is issued on a monthly basis where you will be billed for your total monthly consumption. Customer service Customer Success Manager (CSM). For the first 90 days of the service, you have access to a UKCloud CSM who will help you with your adoption of the UKCloud UKCloud for Oracle Software service. This includes finding relevant systems and how to use UKCloud tools and processes. Cloud Architects. UKCloud Cloud Architects support you during the design of solutions for the cloud platform. UKCloud Cloud Architects are ideally placed to help reconcile your requirements with the UKCloud platform. We recommend engagement with a Cloud Architect when implementing Oracle solutions. Technical Account Managers (TAM). You will be allocated with an assigned point of contact who will provide ongoing assistance with reporting and incident escalation. Support. After the initial on-boarding and design phase, you can utilise the standard UKCloud support entitlement, which is documented in the Customer Engagement Factsheet . Customer responsibilities You are responsible for assessing whether the UKCloud UKCloud for Oracle Software platform can support the various requirements of your application. The control and management of access and responsibilities for end users including appropriate connectivity, security and accreditation if required. If access is required over government secure networks (N3/HSCN, Janet, RLI or PSN), you are responsible for adhering to the relevant Code of Connection (CoCo) and for providing evidence of their CoCo to UKCloud upon request. UKCloud is unable to provide access to secure networks where such evidence has not been provided. Management and administration of layers above the Oracle hypervisor (OS patching, application performance monitoring, user administration). You are also responsible for ensuring only lawful data that supports the UK public sector is stored and processed by applications on this environment, and that they fully comply with the UKCloud Security Operating Procedures (SyOPs) and other information assurance requirements as specified in the UKCloud SISP and associated accreditation documentation sets. Service provisioning Within 4 hours of accepting an order (shorter deployment times are typically achieved and can be prioritised upon request), UKCloud will create the customer's Primary Administrator account and send a welcome pack which includes the URL for the UKCloud Customer Portal, and the getting started guide. UKCloud and Infomentum will provision the Oracle Tenant environment. UKCloud will request information such as private subnets before creating the environment. Once the build is complete, UKCloud will provide you with access to provision Oracle virtual machines and Oracle networks. UKCloud has created several videos, help guides, manuals and FAQs to help train and instruct users so that they are up and running quickly and easily. These are available within the UKCloud Knowledge Centre . In addition, you will be assigned a Customer Success Manager (CSM) to provide any assistance required during the first 90 days of the service. UKCloud also has a large ecosystem of partners who can deliver additional services, such as support and professional services. UKCloud would be pleased to introduce you to the right partner to suit your needs. Service constraints UKCloud will adhere to the following in terms of maintenance windows: \"Planned Maintenance\" means any pre-planned disruptive maintenance to any of the infrastructure relating to the service. Planned Maintenance activity may result in periods of degradation or loss of availability depending on the nature of the activity required. In such cases, if you will be affected then UKCloud shall provide you with at least fourteen (14) days' notice of the Planned Maintenance. If during Planned Maintenance there is a loss of availability outside the scope described in the planned maintenance notification to the service, an SLA event will be triggered. For OVMs, this time will be excluded from the availability calculation but will be included in monthly service reporting related to the service. \"Emergency Maintenance\" means any urgent maintenance required to prevent or mitigate against any event compromising the infrastructure relating to the service. Whenever possible, UKCloud will: a) provide affected customers with at least six (6) hours' advanced notice and; b) carry out the emergency maintenance between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Friday or between the hours of Saturday 00:00 to 06:00 (UK local time) on Monday, (including bank holidays) unless there is an identified and demonstrable immediate risk to customer environment(s). Emergency Maintenance may result in periods of degradation or loss of availability depending on the nature of the activity required. If during Emergency Maintenance there is a loss of availability to the service, an SLA event will be triggered. This time will be excluded from the availability calculation but will be included in monthly service reporting related to the service.

    "keywords": "VM compatibility with UKCloud for Oracle Software Introduction This article outlines what you need to do to make sure your Oracle VMs (OVMs) are compatible with UKCloud for Oracle Software service. You may find this useful if you're moving VMs from UKCloud for VMware to UKCloud for Oracle Software. OVF and VMDK OVF and VMDK files are not compatible with Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM), the management plane that's used to deploy and manage your UKCloud for Oracle Software environment. To make sure your VMs are compatible with UKCloud for Oracle Software you may need to transform your VMs. OVA files (Assembly option) and tar.gz/tgz (Template option) are the only accepted file formats. OVA If you select the Assembly option on the upload page, then the uploader will expect an OVA Assembly package file ( ova file). Your .ova file should contain the following files (in the exact order listed): MyVM .ovf - the OVF descriptor file, which contains all VM specs metadata and links to the embedded virtual disk image file (with a .vmdk extension) MyVM .mf - contains metadata that is used for integrity and authenticity checks; this data must be correct for the .ova file to be accepted in most cases MyVM .vmdk - the embedded virtual disk image file As the exported .ova file also contains file hashes that are unique to the files included in the package, simply creating a tar file with these contents will not work in most cases. For most virtualisation platforms, it's best to use the export functionality from the source virtualisation platform to generate the .ova file. One way of converting your VMs to an .ova file would be to use the OVF Tool, for example: ovftool \"original.ovf\" \"original.ova\" Tip Make sure you include the quotation marks ( \" ). You can download the OVF Tool from: https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/details?downloadGroup=OVFTOOL400&productId=353 TAR If you select the Template option on the upload page, then the uploader will expect an Oracle VM Template file (either a .tgz or .tar.gz file). This gzipped tarball file normally contains the following files (in the exact order listed): MyVM .cfg - contains the VM specs metadata and links to the embedded RAW disk image file, normally named system.img system.img - the embedded RAW disk image file, either exported from another XEN platform or converted from other virtual disk formats Upload size For any uploads larger than 500 MB, you'll need to allow sufficient time for the upload to complete before clicking the Upload button or it will fail and the item will not appear in your software library. There is currently no upload progress indicator on OEM. Oracle is aware of this but are treating it as an enhancement request therefore there's currently no indication of when the upload progress indicator will be added on future releases of the platform software.

    "title": "Oracle licensing on the UKCloud platform | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Oracle licensing on the UKCloud platform Overview Due to the licensing rules regarding Oracle, it is not possible to install and run Oracle software on the UKCloud public cloud platform. However, there are currently two ways for customers to install and run Oracle software with UKCloud: Private Cloud for Compute . This is a dedicated hardware solution that limits the number of cores, RAM and storage that would require Oracle licensing. Note that this may not be financially efficient for all customers, and this will be a bare metal environment that has not been prepared for Oracle. UKCloud for Oracle Software . This is a solution specifically designed to host Oracle solutions on a separate platform. This enables Oracle licensing to be used correctly, and is also financially efficient. The remainder of this article is regarding general Oracle licensing. Important Licensing rules from vendors such as Oracle can change frequently and so customers should validate their specific requirement with Oracle at the time of ordering. This information is correct as of June 2015. For customers wishing to licence Oracle software on virtual machines within the UKCloud platform, there are some important issues to consider with regards to the four licensing options available which are described below. Named User By implementing this licensing option, the customer can run as many Oracle servers as they want for a fixed fee ‘per named user’. As this licence model is independent of the size or number of servers, it is preferable for use in multi-tenant cloud environments such as the UKCloud platform. UKCloud appreciate that this solution may not be valid for customers that already have ‘per processor” licensing. Per Processor This type of licence allows the customer to have as many users as they need for a fixed cost ‘per processor’ that the servers run on. In a traditional physical or virtualised estate, it is possible to isolate a small subset of the overall physical servers to specifically run Oracle. In this way, only those specific servers need to be licensed for Oracle. In most multi-tenant cloud environments such as the UKCloud platform, the per processor virtual machines can run on any physical server and so, practically, Oracle requires all of those servers to be licensed – which is simply not cost effective. Oracle software within a cloud based environment can also be licensed via the per-processor option if the cloud environment is running Oracle Virtual Machine (OVM) as the hypervisor. However, due to the design of the cloud environment, this is not something UKCloud can provide or support. Oracle has negotiated an agreement with a few public cloud providers (at the time of writing, only Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure) to allow customers to license only specific host servers, but this is not yet a widely available licensing agreement. Dedicated Compute platform Customers can take advantage of the 'per processor' licensing model, by using the UKCloud Dedicated Compute platform which will provide the customer with a set hardware configuration. The Dedicated Compute option enables a customer to specify a dedicated hardware cluster of a certain number of physical servers, and this option can help customers who need more certainty as to the configuration and capacity of the cluster which underpins part of their application, whilst being also able to accommodate the compromises of having a dedicated cluster with regards to reduced levels of agility and flexibility. Application Specific Full Use Licensing An Application Specific Full Use (ASFU) licence is a restricted type of licence sold by a Solution Provider in conjunction with its third-party Application Package. For example, you can buy an ASFU licence from SAP AG to use Oracle with the SAP/R3 system. This licence would then be application specific and cannot be used for anything else. Embedded Software License An Embedded Software License (ESL) is a very restrictive licence type available from Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) who embed Oracle technology into their product. An end-user may not even be aware that the software package contains Oracle technology and should not be able to access it directly as a developer or system administrator. An example of this licensing model in use may be a Point of Sale system that requires a database to log transactions. Note The ASFU and ESL licensing options are outside the scope of UKCloud control.

This Getting Started Guide provides an overview of the functionality available with UKCloud for Oracle Software. Intended audience This guide is intended for customers who want to get up and running with UKCloud for Oracle Software. Introduction to UKCloud for Oracle Software Many applications running in the UK public sector today have a backbone powered by Oracle software. They include ERP solutions, finance systems (such as payroll), HR systems and wide variety of citizen‑supporting applications. Oracle solutions have traditionally been subject to licensing and technical requirements that have made it challenging to carry out cloud transition projects and meet the government's Cloud First policy. UKCloud for Oracle Software enables you to start your cloud journey with your Oracle applications. It overcomes the licensing and technical barriers, and provides the trusted, connected and flexible Assured OFFICIAL and non-internet-connected Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platforms you need to deliver your critical Oracle applications in the cloud. UKCloud for Oracle Software can help you achieve the business goals at the centre of your strategy, without risking your operational ability to execute. The service has been designed and tested for compatibility with the most popular Oracle applications used in citizen‑facing solutions today, including: Oracle database (including features such as encryption and Data Guard) Oracle WebLogic Server Oracle Fusion Applications Oracle Enterprise Manager Oracle E-Business Suite UKCloud for Oracle Software provides workloads with an uncontended infrastructure optimised for the performance and availability of Oracle workloads. You can right‑size the allocated resources to suit the changing demands of your application; ensuring performance and avoiding over‑capacity. You can specify the resource allocation of each workload independently: simply choose the appropriate CPU cores, amount of memory and required storage from the catalogue. The service offers the following technical benefits specific to Oracle workloads: Use of core-pinning technology means that Oracle workloads operating on the UKCloud platform aren't subject to the types of movement that can unbalance Oracle applications running on other cloud platforms The scalable nature of our service enables you to add or remove cores in line with your understanding of the performance requirements of your solution Self-service management of your environment via our Customer Portal, which you can also use to programmatically control your Oracle environment Virtual firewalls to manage connectivity into and out of your environment -- self-service and free of charge IPsec and SSL VPN/SDN to create secure connections between users and other environments using a variety of included tunnelling technologies Basic load balancing to configure active/active solutions that are resilient to outages and can handle high levels of activity, using our on‑platform, out‑of‑the‑box load balancers Persistent storage so that your data remains, even when a virtual machine (VM) is turned off, ensuring that your application data remains consistent and available Oracle licensing compliance UKCloud for Oracle Software does not include Oracle licensing but, because the platform is powered by OVM technology, you can be assured that it is compliant with Oracle's licensing requirements and you can bring your own Oracle licensing to build your solutions. UKCloud ensures that hard partitioning is in place in all customer guest VMs in order to conform to Oracle licensing policies. When you create or modify a VM, automatic CPU pinning ensures that the VM won't use any CPUs other than the ones specifically pinned to the VM's vCPUs.

Changing your console settings You can set various options to personalise your experience in the Cloud Control console. For example, you can choose when to receive VM request, expiry and quota notifications and specify an email address to receive selected notifications. You can also define the default values to use when creating VMs. In the Cloud Control console, click your username and select Preferences and then SSA Portal Settings . On the General tab of the Preferences dialog box, specify your notification settings. On the Infrastructure -- Oracle VM tab, specify default options for new VMs. When you're done, click Apply . Building virtual machines Your Oracle applications will consist of one or more VMs. In the Cloud Console, you create a VM by requesting a server. You can base your VMs on assemblies or templates. On the Infrastructure -- Oracle VM Cloud Services page you can view and manage all your Oracle VMs. More information! How to build an Oracle virtual machine Setting up your network Before you can start using the VMs in your Oracle environment, you need to create the network that connects the VMs to each other, and potentially also to the outside world. This network enables your VMs to communicate with each other or access external networks. A single Oracle tenant can have multiple networks. When UKCloud sets up a new Oracle tenant for you, we'll usually create an edge gateway for that tenant, but the creation of any networks is your responsibility. Networking and connectivity for UKCloud for Oracle Software is managed within vCloud Director, which you access through the UKCloud Portal rather than Enterprise Manager Cloud Control. Note Because you create your network in vCloud Director, you'll see references to VMware terminology, such as organisations and virtual data centres (VDCs). In UKCloud for Oracle Software, an Oracle tenant is equivalent to a VDC. There are two types of network: An isolated (internally connected) network provides access only to the VMs within the Oracle tenant (see How to create an isolated VDC network ). A routed (externally connected) network provides access to machines and networks outside the Oracle tenant via the edge gateway. You can have up to nine usable routed networks per tenant: one for each connectivity type (see How to create a routed VDC network ). Configuring your edge gateway An edge gateway controls how traffic from the outside world comes into and out of your environment. It is very important to make sure that your edge gateway is configured correctly to make your applications available but also secure. The tools for configuring your edge gateway are provided within vCloud Director, which you access through the UKCloud Portal rather than Enterprise Manager Cloud Control. Your edge gateway provides the following services: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) --- The edge gateway can act as a DHCP server for VMs connected to VDC networks connected to an edge (see How to create a DHCP pool ). Network address translation (NAT) --- NAT rules determine where to direct inbound and outbound traffic (see How to create NAT rules ). Firewall --- The firewall controls which networks and ports can communicate through the edge gateway (see How to create firewall rules ). Static routing --- Provides static routes from the edge gateway to other networks, for example, networks in other VDCs in your compute service (see How to create a static route ). VPN --- IPsec site-to-site VPN is available on the edge gateway (see How to configure IPsec VPN ). Load balancing --- The edge gateway provides simple HTTP and HTTPS load balancing using round robin (see How to configure a load balancer ). Logging out of the Cloud Control console When you're done working in the Cloud Control console, we recommend that you log out to prevent unauthorised access. To log out of the Cloud Control console, click your user name and select Log Out . Next steps In this Getting Started Guide, you've learned the basics about UKCloud for Oracle Software.

    "keywords": "How the UKCloud OpenStack platform outperforms hyperscalers The evolution of UKCloud UKCloud has long been known for its VMware powered UKCloud for VMware service, which has enabled hundreds of UK Public Sector workloads to be moved to the cloud. In response to increasing demand from customers creating genuine cloud native (12-Factor) applications, we have developed and launched our UKCloud for OpenStack service, powered by OpenStack – the leading open-source alternative to the proprietary global public cloud platforms. The OpenStack service that is available today has been vastly improved in terms of reliability, functionality and performance. Although there are several cloud providers available to the UK Public Sector, UKCloud maintains its position as the number one choice for security assured citizen-facing services with UK data centres and UK-based security cleared staff. There are several factors to consider when choosing a cloud provider, such as price, performance, reliability, suitability for workloads, sovereignty and assurance. Value for money will often be at the forefront of the decision-making process. However, at UKCloud we are competitive on more than just price and believe performance is an important metric to consider. This document will concentrate on performance benchmarking and introduces a comparison of performance on our OpenStack platform against other public cloud providers. Based on our innovative, next generation infrastructure Our OpenStack platform is deployed on our innovative, next generation infrastructure. Rather than a SAN-based converged infrastructure, our next generation infrastructure is built on commodity hardware and leverages software defined data centre (SDDC) technology including software defined networking (Cisco ACI and OpenStack Neutron) and software defined storage (Red Hat Ceph). This new infrastructure is designed to deliver much greater levels of scalability via multiple fault domains to improve availability and resilience. As bottlenecks such as the storage array and network functions are replaced with highly distributed resources, the new infrastructure is designed to deliver much greater levels of performance compared with our previous infrastructure. Why does performance matter? These results are important for several reasons: Cost control – the superior performance of the UKCloud platform means that you can do more with less. To match our performance using the public cloud providers, you would need bigger instances, more instances or both – significantly increasing the cost of those platforms. A platform that appears 20% cheaper but has half the performance may mean you end up paying 60% more for the same performance. Developer productivity – our OpenStack platform has been designed specifically for agile software development projects where there is a real demand for environments to be provisioned rapidly and destroyed when no longer needed. Superior performance means that pipeline automation happens quickly and reliably so your developers aren't blocked waiting for the infrastructure to be ready. User experience – as digital systems are increasingly used directly by millions of potential users (for example, citizens), it's important that your platform can deliver superior performance when your users need it. Our approach to benchmarking To validate the performance of our platform, UKCloud has been running automated tests to compare the performance of UKCloud for OpenStack against two leading proprietary public cloud platforms, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. The benchmarking was based on the PerfKit Benchmarker tool which was originally developed by Google and made available to the open-source community. PerfKit is designed to provide a repeatable, consistent and open way of measuring cloud performance. PerfKit was configured to specifically compare the UKCloud Region 5, Zone C UKCloud for OpenStack platform with AWS EU-West 2 (London) region and the Azure London region. The benchmarks ran throughout August 2017 and average values for the month are reported below. Benchmark results UKCloud performed a suite of tests to assess the performance of various components of the platform, as well as some end-to-end system tests. The following pages provide more detail regarding each of the benchmark results. Note For the graphs shown in this document, apart from instance boot time where a lower result is better, a higher result indicates superior performance. (UKCloud outperforms both AWS and Azure on 90% of benchmarks performed). Instance boot time Instance boot time refers to the amount of time taken for an instance to boot from a powered off state. The graph below shows that UKCloud instances on the UKCloud for OpenStack platform boot 1.5 times faster than AWS and almost 7 times faster than Azure. This means that you will benefit from reduced delay in loading the instances and the end user is able to quickly access the applications within them. MongoDB MongoDB is an open-source database developed by MongoDB, Inc. Unlike relational databases, it stores data in JSON format that can vary in structure. This data model gives you the ability to represent hierarchical relationships and other complex structures easily. MongoDB was designed with high availability and scalability and therefore includes out-of-the-box replication and auto-scaling. The performance of MongoDB running on the UKCloud for OpenStack platform is 2 times faster than AWS and almost 2 times faster than Azure meaning that MongoDB performs over twice as many operations per second on the UKCloud platform. This results in better database performance with UKCloud and means there is higher data availability to applications, which in turn affects the service that a customer consumes, resulting in a better customer experience. Network performance The networking performance test is a commonly used benchmark that can create TCP and UDP data streams and measures the throughput of a network that is carrying them. The values shown in the graph below indicate the maximum throughput of the respective networks. UKCloud has a maximum throughput almost 12 times higher than AWS and almost 19 times higher than Azure. This is important for customers who are moving large sets of data or need quick access to their data over the network. This results in less time spent waiting for data transfers to be completed, which allows applications to access their data more quickly. Ultimately meaning applications can run faster, giving a better user experience. Random IO performance Random read is a measure of how quickly multiple small files can be read from random areas on a disk. Random read performance is measured in input-output operations per second with the number shown below an indication of the maximum number of reads. Random write uses the same disk pattern as random read but data is written to the disk rather than read. The graph below shows that the UKCloud for OpenStack platform performs over 5 times more random read IOPs than AWS and over 34 times more than Azure. For random write, the UKCloud platform performs over 4 times more IOPs than AWS and over 27 times more than Azure. This means that enterprise applications such as relational databases which are disk-intensive (require high I/O), perform better on the UKCloud platform. Databases and applications that are disk intensive are often slowed down by their storage, hence the increased popularity of Solid State Drives (SSD). However, as the graph below shows, UKCloud provides fast storage access allowing applications to rapidly access and process data, resulting in faster applications compared to AWS and Azure's equivalent storage option. Sequential IO performance Sequential read is a disk access pattern in which large continuous blocks of data are read from adjacent locations on the disk. Sequential write is the same pattern, but data is written to the disk rather than read. These kinds of disk access patterns are common when accessing large multimedia files such as music, video and images. They are also important for data warehouses and analytical applications. The graph below shows that for sequential read the UKCloud platform performs almost 11 times better than AWS and over 5 times better than Azure. For sequential write, the UKCloud platform has a maximum IO over 10 times higher than AWS and over 6 times higher than Azure. As with databases, these kinds of applications are often slowed down by their storage, hence the increased popularity of Solid State Drives (SSD). However, as the graph below shows, UKCloud provides fast storage access allowing applications to rapidly access and process data, resulting in faster applications compared to AWS and Azure's equivalent storage option. High sequential IO performance is vital for data analysis and specifically for data warehouses which are a core component of business intelligence and thus guide key management decisions. Where does the UKCloud OpenStack platform outperform both hyperscalers? The data in the benchmark results section shows that the UKCloud for OpenStack platform consistently outperforms both hyperscalers across a variety of benchmarks including: Instance Boot Time 1.5 times faster than AWS Almost 7 times faster than Azure Reduced delay in loading the instances means that users are able to readily access the applications within them Networking Performance Almost 12 times higher than AWS Almost 19 times higher than Azure Users spend less time transferring data on the network, allowing applications to access their data faster and thus running faster MongoDB 2 times faster than AWS Almost 2 times faster than Azure Better database performance allows for higher data availability to applications, therefore resulting in a better customer experience Random I/O Performance Random Read is over 5 times faster than AWS and over 34 times faster than Azure Random Write is over 4 times faster than AWS and over 27 times faster than Azure Faster storage access allows applications to rapidly access and process data and thus results in faster applications Sequential I/O Performance Sequential Read is almost 11 times better than AWS and over 4 times better than Azure Sequential Write is over 10 times higher than AWS and over 6 times higher than Azure High sequential IO performance is vital for data analysis and specifically for data warehouses, it is a core component of business intelligence and thus guides key management decisions Summary Although a platform may appear cheaper, if it has half the performance this may mean you could end up paying significantly more for the same performance. Using UKCloud's OpenStack platform means that you can do ‘more for less’ as you can save money with simple usage-based billing and benefit from the greater performance the platform offers. While actual performance may vary based upon numerous real-world factors such as internet latency, application-tuning and a minimal risk of multi-tenant contention, we are confident that these benchmark results truly reflect the greater performance that UKCloud for OpenStack delivers over the nearest equivalent region and VM sizes of both AWS and Azure We are continuously investigating ways to improve the performance of our UKCloud for OpenStack platform through using the latest versions of OpenStack, software-defined storage and networking, coupled with adaptive storage and network tuning as the platform is consumed. All of this will reassure our customers that the greater performance delivered today, will remain in the future.

    "title": "How to change IPsec VPN settings via the vCloud API | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to change IPsec VPN settings via the vCloud Director API Overview This guide shows you how to retrieve, modify, and submit blocks of XML that represent the configuration of the IPsec VPN tunnels. The guide covers modifications to the local and peer IP addresses, local and peer IDs as well the addition or removal of local and peer subnets. In addition to this, the guide also outlines the steps required to modify the shared secret key used on a given IPsec VPN tunnel. Use cases: Enabling customers to quickly amend IPsec configurations Modifications of this nature are not possible in the vCloud Director graphical user interface without first deleting the existing IPsec VPN configuration entirely and re-entering the settings. Depending on the number of tunnels, this can be a lengthy task. Making changes to the IPsec VPN configuration via the vCloud API can greatly speed up this process. Edge gateway configuration data You can also use the steps in this guide to obtain a backup of the current configuration applied to an edge gateway. You can then use this to restore the configuration of the edge gateway at a later point in time. By following the instructions in this guide you can make amendments to the IPsec VPN configuration without first needing to engage with UKCloud Support. Before you begin Before using the vCloud API to view and update IPsec VPN settings, we recommend that you install a REST client that enables you to access the API. The steps in this article use a Firefox plugin called RESTClient. For information about how to install this plugin, see How to install a REST client to access the vCloud API . You also need to find your API credentials. For more information, see How to access vCloud Director through the vCloud API Obtaining an authorisation token To start interacting with the vCloud API, you first need to obtain an x-vcloud-authorization token; to do this you need to adjust some settings in RESTClient. In your browser, click the RESTClient icon. From the Method menu, select POST . In the API field, enter the API URL you recorded earlier and append the following to the end of the URL: /api/sessions Next add a Basic Authentication header. To do this, from the Authentication menu at the top of the REST Client, select Basic Authentication . In the Basic Authentication dialog box, in the Username field, enter your API username recorded earlier from the API page. In the Password field enter your UKCloud Portal password and then click Okay . The Request section now includes an Authorization header. Next add an Accept header. To do this, from the Headers menu, select Custom Header . In the Request Header dialog box, in the Name field, enter Accept In the Value field enter application/*+xml;version=5.5 and then click Okay . The Headers section should now be displayed, containing the Accept header. The RESTClient has now got all the required settings in place to make a request to the vCloud API to obtain a x-vcloud-authorization token, so click the Send button. When a response is received the Headers tab in the Response section will be populated, including an x-vcloud-authorization token. The x-vcloud-authorization token will replace the Basic Authentication header added earlier. To do this highlight and copy the string of characters displayed after the word x-vcloud-authorization . Note If at any point while following the instructions in this guide, the output displayed in the REST Client does not look similar to that shown in the images, you can use the value of the Status Code field to determine what went wrong and needs investigation. In this case above, Status Code received was HTTP 200 OK, which means that the request succeeded. For a list of HTTP response codes, see HTTP Response Codes . To add an x-vcloud-authorization header, from the Headers menu, select Custom Header . In the Request Header dialog box, in the Name field enter x-vcloud-authorization . In the Value field, paste the string of characters copied in the previous step, then click Okay . Now that you've obtained an x-vcloud-authorization token, you can remove the Basic Authentication Header. Click the x in the upper right-hand corner of the header. ## Retrieving organisation details via the API Retrieving organisation details via the API Now that you've obtained an x-vcloud-authorization token, you can call the vCloud API to retrieve the information that you need about your organisation to set up your IPsec VPN. Set the Method to GET . In the Response section, select the Preview tab. This view lists the links that you can use to drill down into the various objects exposed via the vCloud API. Of interest in the output below is a link that will, when queried, return details about the organisation and the objects contained within it. The link should look something like: https://<api_url>/api/org/<org_id> Copy the URL and paste it into the Request URL field. Click Send . After a short amount of time the contents of the Response Preview tab will be updated to reflect the response from the vCloud API to your latest request, including links to each VDC in the organisation. Retrieving virtual data centre details via the API To retrieve details about the VDCs in an organisation: Copy the link for the VDC containing the target edge gateway for your IPsec VPN. The link should look something like: https>//<api_url>/api/vdc/<vdc_id> Click Send . The contents of the Response Preview tab will be updated again. Retrieving edge gateway configuration via the API To retrieve details of the edge gateway configuration: The response this time will probably be quite long. To easily locate a specific section in the response, use your browser's search utility. You can invoke this in Firefox by pressing CTRL+F . In the search dialog window at the bottom of the screen enter edgeGateways , and then click the down arrow button to locate a section that looks similar to the one shown below: <Link rel=\"edgeGateways\" href=\"https://api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/admin/vdc/<vdc_id>/edgeGateways\" type=\"application/vnd.vmware.vcloud.query.records+xml\" /> Copy the link ending in /edgeGateways and paste it into the URL field at the top of the RESTClient. Ensure that the Method drop down is set to GET and click Send . If this request is successful, the response will contain a link to the edge gateway which, when queried, will return the configuration of the edge gateway. Once you have received a response, use your browser's search utility to locate the EdgeGatewayRecord section within the response. <EdgeGatewayRecord gatewayStatus=\"READY\" haStatus=\"UP\" isBusy=\"false\" name=\"UKCloud Gateway (nft00002i2)\" numberOfExtNetworks=\"1\" numberOfOrgNetworks=\"8\" vdc=\"https://api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/vdc/<vdc_id>\" href=\"https://api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/admin/edgeGateway/<edge_id>\" task=\"https://api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/task/<task_id>\" isSyslogServerSettingInSync=\"true\" taskOperation=\"networkConfigureEdgeGatewayServices\" taskStatus=\"success\" taskDetails=\" \" /> Within the EdgeGatewayRecord section of the above from the response, locate the link to the edge gateway that starts with the following: https://<api_url>/api/admin/edgeGateway/ Appended to the end of the URL will be a unique identifier for the edge gateway within the VDC. Copy this link, paste it into the URL field and then click Send . After a short amount of time the current configuration of the edge gateway will be displayed in a block of XML. Reviewing the edge gateway configuration The edge configuration information is contained between an opening <Configuration> and closing </Configuration> tag. This block of XML is split into sections which detail the configuration settings applied to a specific item, function or service available on the edge gateway. There are twelve sections in total; however only the configuration settings contained under the <GatewayIpsecVpnService> tags will be discussed in this guide. The example below shows a high‑level overview of the structure of the XML block returned, including the <GatewayIpsecVpnServices> tags. <EdgeGateway> <Configuration> <GatewayBackingConfig> </GatewayBackingConfig> <GatewayInterfaces> </GatewayInterfaces> <EdgeGatewayServiceConfiguration> <FirewallService> </FirewallService> <NatService> </NatService> <GatewayIpsecVpnService> </GatewayIpsecVpnService> <StaticRoutingService> </StaticRoutingService> <LoadBalancerService> </LoadBalancerService> </EdgeGatewayServiceConfiguration> <HaEnabled> </HaEnabled> <UseDefaultRouteForDnsRelay> </UseDefaultRouteForDnsRelay> </Configuration> </EdgeGateway\\> Before making any changes to the edge gateway via the API it is highly recommended to keep a copy of the XML returned. You can then use this backup to restore the configuration of the edge gateway to a known working configuration if the need arises. To copy the XML: Select the Response Preview tab of the RESTClient. Scroll down to the opening <Configuration> tag and highlight everything up to and including the closing <\\Configuration> tag. The length of the XML to copy is dependent on the number of NAT, firewall rules and another configuration applied to the edge gateway. With the contents of the <Configuration> tags highlighted, right click and select Copy . Paste the configuration into a text editor, saving the file to a known location on your computer. Using a text editor that offers syntax highlighting such as Notepad++ will simplify the editing process. Locating the IPsec VPN settings in the returned XML To locate the IPsec VPN settings, open a new text editor window and copy and paste the contents between the opening <GatewayIpsecVpnService> and closing </GatewayIpsecVpnService> tags. The contents should look similar to the XML block shown below: <GatewayIpsecVpnService> <IsEnabled>true</IsEnabled> <Endpoint> <Network type=\"application/vnd.vmware.admin.network+xml\" href=\"https://api.vcd.portal.ukcloud.com/api/admin/network/3c284ec8-2850- ba77-098c-7f697a3d8769\"/> <PublicIp>37.26.88.73</PublicIp> </Endpoint> <Tunnel> <Name>UKCloud IPSEC VPN Demo</Name> <Description/> <IpsecVpnThirdPartyPeer> <PeerId>134.170.188.221</PeerId> </IpsecVpnThirdPartyPeer> <PeerIpAddress>134.170.188.221</PeerIpAddress> <PeerId>134.170.188.221</PeerId> <LocalIpAddress>172.26.45.97</LocalIpAddress> <LocalId>172.26.45.97</LocalId> <LocalSubnet> <Name>VPN Test Network 1</Name> <Gateway>192.168.1.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </LocalSubnet> <PeerSubnet> <Name>192.168.2.0/24</Name> <Gateway>192.168.2.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </PeerSubnet> <SharedSecret>UKCloudIPSECVPNDemoSharedSecretKey</SharedSecret> <SharedSecretEncrypted>false</SharedSecretEncrypted> <EncryptionProtocol>AES256</EncryptionProtocol> <Mtu>1500</Mtu> <IsEnabled>true</IsEnabled> <IsOperational>true</IsOperational> </Tunnel> </GatewayIpsecVpnService> Modifying the IPsec VPN configuration This section outlines common tasks performed via the API to manipulate the IPsec VPN configuration applied to a given edge gateway. Modifying the local endpoint IP and local ID You can change the local IP and local ID by editing the contents between the opening <localIpAddress> and closing </localIpAddress> and <localId> and </localId> tags as shown below. Original <LocalIpAddress>172.26.45.97</LocalIpAddress> <LocalId>172.26.45.97</LocalId> Modified <LocalIpAddress>37.26.88.73</LocalIpAddress> <LocalId>37.26.88.73</LocalId> This is by far the most commonly performed modification to the IPsec VPN configuration via the vCloud API. You can use this to change the local IP address from the IP address assigned to the edge gateway on the transit network to the IP address assigned to the edge gateways on the public network. For the tunnel to come up successfully, the local IP address must be set to the edge gateway's public IP address. The local ID must also match the public IP address specified. Modifying the peer endpoint IP and peer ID If you need to move the remote endpoint of the tunnel to a new device or IP address, then you can adjust the following as required. Original <PeerIpAddress>134.170.188.221</PeerIpAddress> <PeerId>134.170.188.221</PeerId> Modified <PeerIpAddress>212.58.244.18</PeerIpAddress> <PeerId>212.58.244.18</PeerId> When changing the peer IP address of the tunnel you must ensure that the peer ID is also updated to match the new peer IP address. Adding or removing local subnets You can add additional local subnets to the IPsec VPN tunnel. This involves adding a new local subnet definition to the IPsec VPN config. Original <LocalSubnet> <Name>VPN Test Network</Name> <Gateway>192.168.1.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </LocalSubnet> Modified <LocalSubnet> <Name>VPN Test Network 1</Name> <Gateway>192.168.1.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </LocalSubnet> <LocalSubnet> <Name>VPN Test Network 2</Name> <Gateway>192.168.3.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </LocalSubnet> Adding or removing peer subnets You can use the same process to add or remove peer subnets Original <PeerSubnet> <Name>192.168.2.0/24</Name> <Gateway>192.168.2.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </PeerSubnet> Modified <PeerSubnet> <Name>192.168.2.0/24</Name> <Gateway>192.168.2.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </PeerSubnet> <PeerSubnet> <Name>192.168.4.0/24</Name> <Gateway>192.168.4.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </PeerSubnet> Amending the shared secret If you need to update or amend the shared secret on an IPsec VPN, edit the value between the opening <SharedSecret> and closing </SharedSecret> tags. Original <SharedSecret>UKCloudIPSECVPNDemoSharedSecretKey</SharedSecret> Modified <SharedSecret>4dae850771fbe3f06588b49772c0b8eb</SharedSecret> Note The shared secret must be at least 32 characters in length. To enhance the security of the tunnel, we highly recommend that you avoid using dictionary words in the shared secret key. Applying the new configuration When you've updated the relevant sections of the configuration, you can apply it to the edge gateway. Enclose the new configuration in a pair of <EdgeGatewayServiceConfiguration> tags, as shown in the following example. <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <EdgeGatewayServiceConfiguration xmlns=\"http://www.vmware.com/vcloud/v1.5\"> <GatewayIpsecVpnService> <IsEnabled>true</IsEnabled> <Endpoint> <Network type=\"application/vnd.vmware.admin.network+xml\" href=\"https://api.vcd.portal.ukcloud.com/api/admin/network/3c284ec8-2850- ba77-098c-7f697a3d8769\\\"/\\> <PublicIp>37.26.88.73</PublicIp> </Endpoint\\> <Tunnel\\> <Name>ukcloud IPSEC VPN Demo</Name> <Description/> <IpsecVpnThirdPartyPeer> <PeerId>212.58.244.18</PeerId> </IpsecVpnThirdPartyPeer> <PeerIpAddress>212.58.244.18</PeerIpAddress> <PeerId>212.58.244.18</PeerId> <LocalIpAddress>37.26.88.73</LocalIpAddress> <LocalId>37.26.88.73</LocalId> <LocalSubnet> <Name>VPN Test Network 1</Name> <Gateway>192.168.1.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </LocalSubnet\\> <LocalSubnet> <Name>VPN Test Network 2</Name> <Gateway>192.168.3.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </LocalSubnet> <PeerSubnet\\> <Name>192.168.2.0/24</Name> <Gateway>192.168.2.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </PeerSubnet> <PeerSubnet> <Name>192.168.4.0/24</Name> <Gateway>192.168.4.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </PeerSubnet> <SharedSecret>4dae850771fbe3f06588b49772c0b8eb</SharedSecret> <SharedSecretEncrypted>false</SharedSecretEncrypted> <EncryptionProtocol>AES256</EncryptionProtocol> <Mtu>1500</Mtu> <IsEnabled>true</IsEnabled> <IsOperational>true</IsOperational> </Tunnel> </GatewayIpsecVpnService> </EdgeGatewayServiceConfiguration\\>** Copy and paste this configuration into the Request Body section of the RESTClient. From the Method list, select POST . Append the following to the URL in the URL field: /action/configureServices For example, if the original contents of the URL were: https://<api_url>/api/admin/edgeGateway/48fbb9e-2e90-c055-aa46-86f18766f5b1 The updated URL would be: https://<api_url>/api/admin/edgeGateway/48fbb9e-2e90-c055-aa46-86f18766f5b1/action/configureServices You must also add one more Header to the RESTClient prior to submitting the new configuration. From the Headers menu at the top of the REST Client select Custom Header . In the Name field, enter Content-Type . In the Attribute Value field enter the following: application/vnd.vmware.admin.edgeGatewayServiceConfiguration+xml Click Okay . To submit the new configuration, click Send . The status of the edge gateway as viewed from vCloud Director will briefly show as Updating Configuration . Once this process has completed, right click the edge gateway and select Configure Services . In the Configure Services window select the VPN tab. You should see the new configuration settings. Verify the status of the IPsec VPN tunnel on your remote device to ensure that the tunnel has been established successfully.

    "title": "How to use the OpenStack Command Line Client on Microsoft operating systems | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to use the OpenStack Command Line Client on Microsoft operating systems Overview OpenStack has been designed and built specifically for the Linux community utilising the Python programming language. Despite this, it's still possible to use the OpenStack Command Line Client on a Microsoft operating system using PowerShell, and this document outlines the six simple steps to achieve this. Install Python runtime and libraries Set Windows environmental variables Install pip - Python packaging manager Install the OpenStack Command Line Client Bind your OpenStack credentials using the OpenStack RC file Test your configuration Prerequisites This document assumes you're running a version of Windows from XP upwards and that Windows PowerShell is already installed and available. All details outlined in this document have been tested against Windows 7 SP1 Enterprise. Installation Steps Install Python runtime and libraries Download the latest Python 2 release from the Python website: http://python.org/downloads/windows/ Note The OpenStack client currently only supports Python 2.7, Python 3+ is unsupported). After clicking the most recent Python 2 release, download the Windows X86-64 MSI Installer. Install Python by double-clicking the MSI package that you just downloaded and completing the installation wizard. Set the environmental variables For Windows to be aware of Python you need to declare its path as follows: Open the Computer settings. Select Advanced system settings . Select Environment variables . In the Environment Variables dialog box, find the Path variable in the System variables list and click Edit . In the Edit System Variable dialog box, in the Variable value field, add the following to the end of the value (make sure to include the semicolons): ;C:\\Python27;C:\\Python27\\Scripts Click OK Note Update the above paths if you choose to change the Python installer defaults. Close the remaining windows. Install pip Open a command prompt with Admin rights by right-clicking on the command prompt icon (when you get a login prompt, enter your admin credentials). Install pip by entering the following command: easy_install pip If successful, you should see a screen like the following: [!IMPORTANT] Leave the command prompt open for the next step. Install the OpenStack Command Line client Install pip with the following command: pip install python-openstackclient Installing the client may take between 1 to 5 minutes depending upon your machine. Bind your OpenStack credentials After successful installation, you'll have to download the OpenStack RC file for the project you want to manage. Log in to the OpenStack Horizon dashboard. Open the project you want to manage. From the menu, select Access & Security and then select the API Access tab. Click Download OpenStack RC File and save the file in a convenient place. Download the Source-OpenRC.ps1 PowerShell script and save it locally. As the downloaded PowerShell script is unsigned, you'll need to unblock it by right-clicking the file, selecting Properties , then clicking the Unblock button and clicking OK . Start Windows PowerShell from the Start menu. Run the downloaded PowerShell script, and give the path to the downloaded RC file as an argument, for example: C:\\Downloads\\Source-OpenRC.ps1 C:\\Downloads\\project-openrc.sh Note Replace Downloads with the directory you saved your files to and replace project-openrc.sh with the openrc.sh filename you downloaded. When prompted, enter your OpenStack project password. Test your configuration Now you've installed and configured the everything, you can start using the command line tools. Start Windows PowerShell. Test if everything is working with a simple list command: nova list If you've started with an empty project, you'll get output similar to the following: +----+------+--------+------------+-------------+----------+ | ID | Name | Status | Task State | Power State | Networks | +----+------+--------+------------+-------------+----------+ +----+------+--------+------------+-------------+----------+ Note You'll need to run the PowerShell script defined above, and provide your OpenStack project credentials every time you relaunch PowerShell. Upgrading clients The community regularly releases updates to the OpenStack CLI, therefore we suggest you check for updates to the client to ensure you have access to all the latest features; this can also help to resolve errors you experience when using the OpenStack CLI. Upgrade pip Open a command prompt with Admin rights by right-clicking on the command prompt icon (when you get a login prompt, enter your admin credentials). Upgrade pip by entering the following command: python -m pip install --upgrade pip Note Once successfully upgraded, leave the command prompt open for the next step. Upgrade the OpenStack Command Line client Install pip with the following command: pip install --upgrade python-openstackclient Installing the client may take between 1 to 5 minutes depending upon your machine.

    "title": "How to manage how your instance recovers from a host failure | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to manage how your instance recovers from a host failure Overview UKCloud monitors UKCloud for OpenStack at regular intervals, checking for issues with the hardware or services supporting OpenStack. When a host experiences problems, our engineers will take steps to live migrate any instances on the affected host to an alternative one, however there may be cases where a host needs to be rebooted prior to any live migrations being successfully actioned. This guide outlines UKCloud's policy for handling OpenStack instances in the event of a service interruption to the availability of a host. The guide also describes how you can control the running state instances return when a host has been recovered. How does instance recovery work? If a host restarts, or if we have to reboot a host before live migrating your instances, any instances running on that host will be shut off. When we recover a host, there are two options for the recovery state of any instances that may have been affected: Manual restart of instance (default) - you must restart any affected instances when the host has been recovered Automatic restart of an instance - UKCloud will automatically restart any shut off instances on a recovered host You can set the recovery option for each of your instances in the instance metadata. Using the OpenStackClient command-line interface You can use the OpenStackClient command-line interface (CLI) to view and set the instance recovery option as follows: Checking the recovery option for an instance (CLI) To use the OpenStackClient CLI to check the recovery option for an instance: Run the following command from the OpenStackClient CLI: openstack server show <instance_ID_or_name> If the properties field in the results includes RestartOnFail='True' (as shown below), then your instance is set to automatically restart when the host has been recovered. If the properties field does not include RestartOnFail , then your instance will remain in a shut off state when the host has been recovered and you'll have to manually restart it. Setting the recovery option for an instance (CLI) To use the OpenStackClient CLI to set the recovery option for an instance: To set the recovery option so that the instance is automatically restarted when the host has been recovered, run the following command: openstack server set -- property RestartOnFail=True <instance_ID_or_name> To set the recovery option so that you must manually restart the instance when the host has been recovered, run the following command: openstack server unset -- property RestartOnFail <instance_ID_or_name> Using the OpenStack Horizon dashboard If you prefer, you can use the OpenStack Horizon dashboard to view and set the recovery option for an instance. Checking the recovery option for an instance (Horizon) To use the Horizon dashboard to check the recovery option for an instance: In the left side of the Horizon dashboard, expand the Compute menu and click Instances . On the Instances page, from the Actions list for your instance, select Update Metadata . In the Update Instance Metadata dialog box, if the Existing Metadata section includes the RestartOnFail='True' (as shown below), then your instance is set to automatically restart when the host has been recovered. If the Existing Metadata section does not include the RestartOnFail tag, then your instance will remain in a shut off state when the host has been recovered and you'll have to manually restart it. Setting the recovery option for an instance (Horizon) To use the Horizon dashboard to set the recovery option for an instance: In the left side of the Horizon dashboard, expand the Compute menu and click Instances . On the Instances page, from the Actions list for your instance, select Update Metadata . In the Update Instance Metadata dialog box: To set the recovery option so that the instance is automatically restarted when the host has been recovered, in the Custom field, enter RestartOnFail and click the + button. Then, in the RestartOnFail field, enter True . To set the recovery option so that you must manually restart the instance when the host has been recovered, next to the RestartOnFail field, click the – button. Click Save . Exclusions to UKCloud-managed instance recovery Although we've designed UKCloud for OpenStack to provide a level of hardware resilience, UKCloud, like most true cloud vendors, cannot guarantee total automated recovery of virtual resources in the event of infrastructure failures. As a result, you must ensure that the applications you deploy on OpenStack have been engineered to tolerate any infrastructure issues or failures through utilising multiple instances deployed across different zones to help ensure the overall availability of your solution.

    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for OpenStack Overview If you're new to UKCloud, you'll probably have received this guide as part of your welcome email. This Getting Started Guide covers basic topics like where to find your instances (virtual machines, or VMs, in VMware terminology), as well as more in-depth topics such as instance storage choice (ephemeral or volume storage) and its implications. Intended audience This guide is intended for users who want to learn more about UKCloud for OpenStack. Logging in to the OpenStack Horizon dashboard The first thing you need to do is to log in to the OpenStack Horizon dashboard. Go to the URL provided in your welcome email. The examples in this guide use https://cor00005.cni.ukcloud.com/ . Enter your login credentials and click Connect . After logging in, the first screen you'll see is the Overview page. From here you can get an immediate summary of your project and show your resource usage against the quotas on the project. Creating your network infrastructure Before you can begin creating instances, you must first build out the underlying network infrastructure. In a freshly provisioned project, the only resource that will exist initially is a shared external network called internet . You need to create the following minimum set of resources: A router using the internet external network A network and associated subnet, specifying the network address using CIDR notation (for example, 192.168.1.0/24), and DHCP settings for DNS, static routes, and so on. A router interface to connect the router to your new subnet When you have created these elements, you can view them in the Network Topology page in the Horizon dashboard. You can create your network infrastructure in one of the following ways: Using Horizon to manually create your infrastructure (see Using Horizon to manually create your infrastructure ) Using the OpenStack Heat orchestration tool to create stacks (see Using the OpenStack Heat orchestration tool to create stacks ) Using the OpenStack API and automation (see [Using the OpenStack API and automation](#using the-openstack-api-and-automation)) Using Horizon to manually create your infrastructure The Network Topology page is a useful page to get started with. This page provides a resizable, moveable and interactive view of your OpenStack project, along with easily accessible buttons for manually creating routers and networks and for launching instances. To create your network infrastructure: In the Horizon dashboard, expand the Network menu on the left side of the screen and select Network Topology . On the Network Topology page, click the Create Router button. In the Create Router dialog box, enter a Router Name . From the Admin State list, ensure that UP is selected so that the router is online at the point of creation. From the External Network list, select the external network to which you want to attach your router. Click Create Router . Back on the Network Topology page, click the Create Network button. On the Network page of the Create Network wizard, enter a Network Name and click Next . On the Subnet page, enter a Subnet Name . In the Network Address field, allocate your network a suitable address space. In the Gateway IP field, enter an IP address from the address space for the router you created earlier to use to access the network. Click Next . On the Subnet Details page, the only field you'll probably want to change is DNS Name Servers . UKCloud does not provide DNS as a service, so to start with you could make use of Google's public 8.8.8.8 service. You can update this field later if you intend to run your own DNS caching service. If you leave the Allocation Pools field blank, then by default the whole address space is used for the pool. Click Create . To add the router interface to link your new network to the router, on the Network Topology page, select the router and click the Add Interface button. In the Add Interface dialog box, from the Subnet list, select your subnet and then click Add Interface . Understanding access and security Security groups In OpenStack, rather than deploying a perimeter firewall to protect your network from the outside world, every instance is protected by its own firewall. This instance firewall is applied at the network level, independent of any additional firewall the guest operating system may be using. The instance firewall is controlled by applying one or more security groups to the instance, either at instance creation or real-time at any point during the lifecycle of the instance. Where multiple security groups are specified, the firewall rules are the result of compounding all the rules together. A security group consists of one or more rules. Each rule is composed of five elements: Role --- Custom or predefined protocol type (for example, TCP, UDP or ICMP) Direction --- Ingress or Egress Open Port or Port Range --- Open either a single port or a range of ports Remote --- The source of the traffic to be allowed via this rule (source address for an inbound rule, or destination address for an outbound rule) The ether type (that is IPv4 or IPv6) --- Not currently available When adding a new rule to a security group, you can choose from a pre-populated list of common rules, for example, SSH, DNS, HTTP or SMTP, or you can specify your own custom rule. SSH key pairs Another change if you're used to using vCloud Director, is the authenticated access to your instances. OpenStack, like most other cloud providers, doesn't use templates that allow password controlled access. The standard cloud method of authenticating access to a new instance is to use SSH key pair authentication --- your SSH client uses the private key and OpenStack injects the public key into your new instance using the cloud-init package pre-installed in the instance image. Before you launch any instances on OpenStack, you need to set up at least one SSH key pair. You can use OpenStack to create a new key pair for you, or if you have an existing SSH key pair, you can import the public key so that OpenStack can use it to inject into new instances. To see what public keys have already been set up for your use: In the Horizon dashboard, expand the Compute menu on the left side of the screen and select Access & Security . Select the Key Pairs tab. If you want OpenStack to create a key pair for you: Click the Create Key Pair button. In the Create Key Pair dialog box, enter a Key Pair Name and then click Create Key Pair . OpenStack creates the key pair and downloads it in your web browser. Save the file somewhere safe as you will need it when connecting your SSH client to your instances. To import an existing public key: On the Key Pairs tab of the Access & Security page, click the Import Key Pair button. In the Import Key Pair dialog box, enter a Key Pair Name and paste the contents of your existing public key file into the Public Key field. Click Import Key Pair . Note for Windows users If you're using a Windows desktop environment, the chances are that you're using the PuTTY program for your SSH client. The PuTTY SSH client doesn't use OpenSSH format files for the key pair files. It does however provide a PuTTYgen program that can import and export in the correct format as outlined below. If you want OpenStack to create your key pair: Open PuTTYgen. From the Conversions menu select Import key . Select the downloaded private key file generated by OpenStack. Click the Save private key button to save the imported key as a ppk file that PuTTY can use for authentication. If you want to import an existing key: Open PuTTYgen. Click the Generate button. Copy the public key from the top of the dialog box. Paste the public key into the Public Key field in Horizon's Import Key Pair dialog box. Launching your instances Now that you've considered security, created a network and a subnet, and you've connected them to your external network with a router, you can start to think about launching some instances attached to the network. There are a few choices you need to make when launching your instances. The following sections outline how to achieve this task via the Horizon dashboard, however you can also use HEAT templates or the OpenStack API. Choosing your image When you create an instance in OpenStack, its disk is cloned from an image managed by OpenStack. The image may be a custom image that has been developed for a specific purpose and uploaded to your project. It may also be a custom image that has been specifically shared between two projects. More likely, you'll start by using one of the public images that we provide and manage on our platform. You can see the images that are available for you to use by expanding the Compute menu on the left side of the Horizon dashboard and clicking Images . Choosing your instance size If you're already familiar with UKCloud's vCloud Director-based Enterprise Compute Cloud service, then you may be used to being able to choose exactly how many vCPUs and how much memory a VM is allocated. In OpenStack, you choices are restricted to a number of pre-defined flavors that define how many vCPUs, how much memory and how much storage an instance may use. Although full details for each flavor are available through the Horizon UI, there's no overall list available showing all the different flavors and sizes of instances. However, if you've installed the OpenStack CLI tools (see http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/common/cli-install-openstack-command-line-clients.html ), you can run the following command to retrieve a list of the flavors and their makeup \\> openstack flavor list Choosing your storage type There are two storage options available for use with your instances: Ephemeral storage (default) Persistent volume storage Ephemeral storage When you create an instance, the default behaviour is to clone your chosen disk image onto the physical disk attached to the host that will be running the instance. This is not dedicated locally attached storage to your instance, but rather a RAID array of fast SSD disks that is shared by all the instances running on the host hypervisor. The performance of the ephemeral storage makes for very fast disk access. However, as the disk image is stored locally on the host hypervisor, you're at risk of data loss in the event of hardware failure on the host. For scheduled maintenance on the host, you can live‑migrate instances onto other hosts with minimal interruption. If the host were to suffer a hardware failure, it's likely that you'd lose the data stored on the disk image, so you should architect your application to expect and be able to recover from failure. Persistent volume storage As an alternative to ephemeral storage you can clone your chosen disk image to an OpenStack volume , which is a persistent storage option backed by a Ceph storage array. The volume is then network mounted onto the host hypervisor and the instance booted from the network attached storage. For scheduled maintenance on the host, these instances are more easily managed onto other hosts. In the event of a hardware failure on the host, the volume can just be mounted to another host and the instance restarted without any data loss. For more information about volumes, see Working with volumes . Creating an instance You can create a new instance in the Horizon UI. Click or select Launch Instance on one of the following pages: Images page (under the Compute menu) Instances page (under the Compute menu) Network Topology page (under the Networks menu) On the Details tab of the Launch Instance dialog box, enter an Instance Name and select a Flavor . As you select a flavor from the list, the dialog box updates to reflect the VCPUs , Disk and RAM that the selected flavour gives you and the green bars under Project Limits update to show what your usage would be after launching the instance. If you select a flavour that would take you over your project's quota, the bar is red rather than green. From the Instance Boot Source list, select: Boot from image to create an instance that boots from the local ephemeral storage. Boot from image (creates a new volume) to create an instance that boots from a volume From the Image Name list, select your preferred image. If you're creating an image that boots from a volume, you can choose what size to create the boot disk without being restricted to the disk allocation specified by the selected flavour. On the Access & Security tab, from the Key Pair list, select the SSH key pair you want to inject into your new instance. If there is only one SSH key pair configured in your project, it will be automatically selected. Select one or more Security Groups to apply to the instance. On the Networking tab, from the Available networks list, select the network that you want to create the new instance on. If your project has only a single network defined, that network will already be listed under Selected networks . Click Launch and OpenStack reports that your new instance is launching. Accessing your instance Having successfully launched your new instance, you'll want to log in and start installing your applications. To access your new instance from the outside world, you have to associate a floating IP address to the instance. A floating IP address is a public routable address that is allocated to your project. Having allocated an address to your project, you can then choose to associate it to a particular instance. When you've done this, a DNAT rule is automatically created on the router you created earlier to forward all incoming traffic to your chosen instance. To associate a floating IP address to your new instance: On the Instances page, from the Actions list for your instance, select Associate Floating IP . In the Manage Floating IP Associations dialog box, from the IP Address list, select the floating IP address that you want to allocate to the instance. If you don't have any spare floating IP addresses allocated to your project, you can click the + button next to the IP Address list to allocate a new address. In the Allocate Floating IP dialog box, from the Pool list, select the pool from which to allocate the floating IP address. Currently the only option is internet , but the list will expand as additional networks come online. Click Allocate IP to allocate the new floating IP address to your project. Back in the Manage Floating IP Associations dialog box, associate the new address with your instance. Click Allocate IP . You can use your SSH client to connect to the floating IP address, authenticating the connection with the private key that matches the key pair you selected when you launched the instance. You can find more information about using and controlling instances and images on OpenStack in the Red Hat documentation at https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/8/instances-and-images-guide/instances-and-images-guide . Working with volumes Creating a volume Volumes are block devices that you can attach to instances. Because volumes are replicated across OpenStack's storage array, effectively providing three copies of data from a resilience perspective, they provide the basis of our persistent storage offering. In the Horizon dashboard, expand the Compute menu on the left side of the screen and select Volumes . On the Volumes page, click the Create Volume button. In the Create Volume dialog box, enter a Volume Name and Description . From the Volume Source list, select: No source, empty volume to create a totally empty volume for customer to populate with their data (this is the default option) Image to enable customer to create a prepopulated volume from a previously created image From the Volume Type list, select: Tier 1 for our most performant block storage for workloads requiring consistently higher disk throughput Tier 2 for block storage with typical performance characteristics for use by production applications or storage (this is the default option) From the Size list, select the size of your volume in GiB. From the Availability Zone list, select the availability zone to which you want to target your volume. Create Create Volume . Retyping a volume You can retype a volume to take an existing volume of a particular volume type and converting it to another (that is, from Tier 1 to Tier 2 or vice versa). Retyping a volume attached to an instance Due to a dependency on the underlying hypervisor, it is not currently possible to retype a volume that is attached to an instance. If you want to retype a volume that is attached to an instance, you must first detach the volume from the instance. To detach the volume from the instance, in the Horizon dashboard, expand the Compute menu on the left side of the screen and select Volumes . On the Volumes page, for the volume that you want to detach, from the list on the far right of the page, select Manage Attachments . In the Manage Volume Attachments dialog box, click the Detach Volume button. Retype the volume by following the steps in Retyping an independent volume . On the Volumes page, for the volume that you want to reattach, from the list on the far right, select Manage Attachments . In the Manage Volume Attachments dialog box, from the Attach to Instance list, select the instance to which you want to reattach the volume and click the Attach Volume button. Note If you attempt to retype a volume that is still attached to an instance, the process will attempt to run but will fail without notification. Retyping an independent volume If the volume that you want to retype is not attached to an instance, you can retype it. Ensure that the volume is detached from any instances. For information about how to detach an volume from an instance, see Retyping a volume attached to an instance . In the Horizon dashboard, expand the Compute menu on the left side of the screen and select Volumes . On the Volumes page, for the volume that you want to retype, from the list on the far right of the page, select Change Volume Type . In the Change Volume Type dialog box, from the Type drop down list, select the new type for the volume. From the Migration Policy list, ensure that you select On Demand . Note If any other option is selected, the retyping process will not work. Click Change Volume Type . Note You may notice duplicate volumes while the retyping process is running. These duplicate volumes will disappear when the process has completed. Important Do not attach a retyped volume to an instance until the retyping process has completed successfully. Retyping an independent volume using the OpenStack CLI To retype a volume using the OpenStack CLI, use the following command: \\> cinder retype *volume* *volume-type* Where: volume is the name or ID of the volume that you want to retype volume-type is the new volume type Working with the API and automation Using the OpenStack Heat orchestration tool to create stacks OpenStack provides an orchestration tool out of the box. The Heat tool enables you to describe your infrastructure as a text file, referred to as a Heat template , defining one or more resources using a YAML format. Having defined your resources in your Heat template, you then use the template to create a stack . The stack contains the instantiation of the resources defined in the YAML file, along with a history of events and operations that have happened to the resources in the stack. For an example of what a basic Heat template looks like, take a look at https://github.com/UKCloud/automation_examples/blob/master/heat/example.yaml The example.yaml template creates the same router, network, subnet and router interface that you created manually above. In addition, the template defines an SSH key pair, security groups and launch instances. We'll look at these other resource elements in more detail later. To use a template to create a stack in your project: In the Horizon dashboard, expand the Orchestration menu on the left side of the screen and select Stacks . On the Stacks page, click the Launch Stack button. On the Select Template page, from the Template Source list, select URL . In the Template URL field, enter the URL of the Raw version of the template that you want to use (for example, the example.yaml template). Click Next . On the Launch Stack page, enter a Stack Name and select the flavour and image as required. Click Launch to start creating the stack resources in the background. You can go back to the Stacks page to view progress, drill down into the resources defined in the stack and see the events as they happen. You can also use an updated Heat template to apply an update to resources in a stack. You can also destroy an entire stack, cleaning up all the resources that you previously created. This makes Heat a very powerful tool for creating short‑lived test and preproduction environments on‑demand that may form part of a continuous delivery pipeline. Using the OpenStack API and automation OpenStack also provides a fully functional API to enable programmatic control over your project. The Horizon UI you used earlier is itself a client that makes calls to this underlying API. Although you can write your own code to interact with the API, there are a number of different libraries already available covering most popular programming languages. Alternatively, there is also a growing number of DevOps automation tools available (for example, Terraform and Ansible) that interact with the OpenStack API to orchestrate the creation and ongoing management of your infrastructure. For an example Terraform configuration to create a similar network infrastructure to the one you created in the previous examples, take a look at https://github.com/UKCloud/automation_examples/tree/master/terraform-os . Whatever library or automation tools you choose to use, you'll need to know a few important details to make a connection to and authenticate against the API. In the Horizon dashboard, expand the Compute menu on the left side of the screen and select Access & Security . On the Access and Security page, select the API Access tab. On the API Access tab, you can see all the relevant API endpoints for making connections to the various OpenStack subsystems, including the Identify endpoint, which provides the initial authentication process, that you'll typically need when configuring connections. You can also download your user's OpenStack RC file for use in the following section. Using the OpenStack command-line client The OpenStack project provides a command‑line client that enables you to access the project API through easy‑to‑use commands. For example, the Compute service provides a NOVA command‑line client. You can run the commands from the command line, or include the commands in scripts to automate tasks. If you provide OpenStack credentials, such as your user name and password, you can run these commands on any computer. The following file is a bash shell script format file that sets up all the relevant environment variables in the Linux shell session so that you can use the OpenStack CLI tools. The OpenStack CLI tools, just like the Horizon UI, also communicate with the OpenStack API. This means you can examine the contents of the RC file to find the settings that you may need to pass into, for example, a Terraform provider definition when configuring it to manage your OpenStack project. The key values to note here are the OS\\_AUTH\\_URL , OS\\_TENANT\\_NAME and OS\\_USERNAME environment variables, as these will be common to any API authentication request. In addition, creating the line export OS\\_INTERFACE=public in the RC file should address any issues you may have accessing the Admin API endpoints. Next steps In this Getting Started Guide, you've learned how to use the OpenStack Horizon UI to set up UKCloud for OpenStack and create new instances. You've also learned about the other tools available including the OpenStack API and command-line client.

    "keywords": "Understanding UKCloud for Microsoft Azure Introduction UKCloud for Microsoft Azure provides you with new options to harness Microsoft Azure alongside other cloud platforms, including Oracle, VMware and OpenStack. This gives you the flexibility to accommodate diverse workloads within a low latency, accredited platform with native connectivity to non-cloud workloads in Crown Hosting and the networks that are vital to the public sector: from PSN Protected to N3/HSCN and RLI. This article provides an introduction to UKCloud for Microsoft Azure and helps you get up and running. Supported features UKCloud for Microsoft Azure supports the following Azure Stack IaaS features: Compute Virtual machines (VMs) provide the basic building block providing compute in Azure Stack. For a list of available VM sizes, see: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-vm-sizes . You can deploy VMs using the Azure Stack portal and other tooling. VMs have the following support: API Azure Stack Marketplace - Provides access to pre-created images that help speed up application delivery Azure Resource Manager - Enables you to write templates to deploy, update and delete Azure Stack resources in a single co-ordinated operation https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-vm-considerations Network Virtual networks - Azure Stack enables you to configure virtual private clouds, create and manage your private address space within Azure; you can configure this via the UI, API and other tooling Load balancers (IPv4 only) — You can deploy basic load balancers VPN gateway — You can use the Azure Stack VPN gateway to create site-to-site VPNs to remote infrastructure Routing — You can configure basic custom defined routing on virtual networks; Vnet to Vnet peering is not yet supported https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-network-differences Storage Type of storage Description Notes vs Azure Azure Blob Storage (block) Object storage; good for storing documents, videos, images and so on Size of disk storage differs significantly, as well as naming standards like name length Azure Blob Storage (page) Used to support virtual machine disks; good for randomly accessed large files Azure Blob Storage (append) Used for log files Azure Queue Storage Message queue as a service to provide asynchronous scale out micro-services, among other things Azure Table Storage NoSQL database service; good for highly scalable, eventually consistent database support Max sizes differ Advanced features Key Vault — Azure Stack provides cryptographic secret storage for applications and services. These services can be consumed by both portal and API. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-kv-intro Design considerations When designing your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure applications, consider the following: Compute Azure Stack supports a subset of Azure VM extensions; UKCloud for Microsoft Azure currently supports the following: BGInfo v2.1 CustomScriptExtension v1.8 JsonADDomainExtension v1.3 VMAccessAgent v2 CustomScriptForLinux v1.5.2.0 OSPatchingForLinux v2.3.0.1 VMAccessForLinux v1.4.0.0 DockerExtension v1.1.1606092330 DSC v2.19.0.0 IaaSAntimalware v1.4.0.0 IaaSDiagnostics v1.10.1.1 MicrosoftMonitoringAgent v1.0.10900.0 For an up-to-date list of the supported extensions, perform the following steps: First, ensure that you've installed the relevant Azure PowerShell tools from the following links: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-powershell-install https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-powershell-download Then run the following commands: Add-AzureRMEnvironment -Name \"AzureStackAdmin\" -ArmEndpoint \"https://management.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com\" Login-AzureRmAccount -EnvironmentName \"AzureStackAdmin\" Get-AzureRmVmImagePublisher -Location frn00006 | ` Get-AzureRmVMExtensionImageType | ` Get-AzureRmVMExtensionImage | ` Select Type, Version | ` Format-Table -Property * -AutoSize Use load balancers to make the best use of IP address quota Azure Stack API may be a couple of releases behind Azure Single region and single state set (affects availability) VM sets don't support auto-scale, so consider how to handle load Check Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates to see if they're compatible with Azure Stack Storage Azure Stack storage is all served from the same pool of disks and does not provide “limitless” storage, so you should consider the following: Use blob storage (object storage) to support the application; not for multiple petabytes of data storage Put large volume data on UKCloud's Cloud Storage Clean up backups to conserve storage Consider use of temporary storage There is a difference in maximum blob storage between Azure and Azure Stack No guarantees around IOPs Use blob storage for queues to help deliver scalable micro-services Accessing UKCloud for Microsoft Azure You can access UKCloud for Microsoft Azure from the following location: https://portal.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com/ Further information For more information about Azure Stack, see the following Microsoft resources: Get Started with Azure Azure Stack Operator Documentation For more information about UKCloud for Microsoft Azure, see: Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for Microsoft Azure UKCloud for Microsoft Azure FAQs Feedback If you have any comments on this article, or any other aspect of your UKCloud experience, send them to products@ukcloud.com ."

    "keywords": "How to create a Service Principal Name for Azure Stack using Azure CLI This document explains how to create a Service Principal Name to manage Azure and Azure Stack using Azure CLI. It will guide you through the creation of: an Azure application a Service Principal Name role assignment permissions What is a Service Principal Name? An Azure Service Principal Name (SPN) is a security identity used by user-created applications, services, and automation tools to access specific Azure resources. Think of it as a 'user identity' (username and password or certificate) with a specific role, and tightly controlled permissions. It only needs to be able to do specific things, unlike a general user identity. It improves security if you grant it only the minimum permissions level needed to perform its management tasks. To log in and manage your resources via SPN you'll need to create an Azure application and then assign SPN to it. Only then will you be able to perform tasks against your environment. Prerequisites Azure CLI Configure Azure CLI Environment for Azure Stack Active Azure Subscription (required to create SPN if you want to use the same SPN for both Azure and Azure Stack) Official Documentation Service Principal Name commands for 2017-03-09-profile Create an Azure Service Principal Name with Azure CLI 2.0 for 2017-03-09-profile Important Currently Azure CLI 2.0.41 is broken and this will NOT work - see GitHub Issue The workaround is to use older Azure CLI How To Install Azure CLI on CentOS CentOS Azure CLI Packages yum install azure-cli-2.0.25-1.el7.x86_64 -y How To Install Azure CLI on Windows Windows Azure CLI MSI Package Overview of the creation process for Azure Stack SPN Prepare your Azure Stack environment - Configure Azure CLI Environment for Azure Stack Create your Azure Stack environment.

As a rule of thumb use PowerShell wherever possible."

This gives you the flexibility to accommodate diverse workloads within a low latency, accredited platform with native connectivity to non-cloud workloads in Crown Hosting and the networks that are vital to the public sector: from PSN Protected to HSCN and RLI. This Getting Started Guide provides you with the information you need to get up and running with UKCloud for Microsoft Azure. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have access to the Azure Stack portal. Introduction to UKCloud for Microsoft Azure At UKCloud, we understand that there is no \"one cloud fits all\" solution. There are usually many factors to consider when looking to move your applications to the cloud, including existing technology investment and skills. Additionally, while some applications can easily move to the public cloud, there are others that for various reasons (latency, connectivity, security, regulation) must run on-premises. Microsoft Azure Stack is an extension of Azure that provides on-premises Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), enabling you to leverage the benefits of cloud in an on-premises environment. UKCloud for Microsoft Azure brings the advantages of the Microsoft Cloud platform to our assured UK-sovereign platform, helping you realise the benefits that a true hybrid cloud environment has to offer, while balancing the right amount of flexibility and control. With UKCloud for Microsoft Azure you can: Leverage existing Azure investment, knowledge and skills Use Azure Stack alongside other technologies, for example, VMware, OpenStack or Oracle Connect to government community networks, including PSN, HSCN, Janet and RLI Meet specific compliance directives, such as data sovereignty or security The two main delivery models provided by UKCloud for Microsoft Azure are: A multi-tenant IaaS and PaaS platform available in both UKCloud security domains (Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL), connected to government community networks with UKCloud's award-winning support Private cloud deployment of UKCloud for Microsoft Azure dedicated to a single customer Before you begin You should have received your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure login credentials from your Azure administrator.

    "keywords": "Virtual machine disk limits and considerations In order to ensure the performance and stability of a customer's VM, whilst also being able to ensure the integrity and validity of VM back-ups, UKCloud advises the following soft limits on storage presented to individual VMs; 2032 GB for each virtual disk (VMDK) presented to a VM, this will ensure normal snapshot functions will operate correctly Maximum of 20 virtual disks presented to a VM Maximum of 40TB overall storage presented to a VM Storage Controllers Increasing the number of disks per controller can have a performance impact, for high I/O machines we'd recommend minimizing the disk to controller ratio, also using the paravirtualised controller can result in greater throughput and lower CPU use. Note VMware Tools is a pre-requisite for the deployment of paravirtualised disks. Snapshots A VMware snapshot is a copy of a VM's disk at a given point in time, it is not a complete copy of the original and rather it only copies the delta disks. An excessive number of delta files in a chain (caused by an excessive number of snapshots) or large delta files may cause decreased virtual machine and host performance. UKCloud recommends the removal of snapshots on a regular basis 24-72 hours in line with VMware best practices to maintain consistent performance of VMs. There will be times when standard platform maintenance tasks need to be performed, resulting in VMs moving around the infrastructure. VMs with large (2TB) hard disks presented will take an extended time for operations to complete, during which time other tasks against the VM could be blocked. UKCloud strongly recommends, where possible, to scale environments horizontally instead of vertically. We understand this may not always be possible, however in doing so you are ensuring reliability and consistency of performance in the environment as it grows, for further design considerations or assistance contact your Account Director who will be able to put you in touch with one of our Cloud Architects.

    "title": "Virtual machine data recovery options | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Virtual machine data recovery options Introduction There are three methods of creating a recovery point for your virtual machines (VMs): VM snapshot - provides the ability to rollback or recover from a change. We recommend that snapshots on a single VM do not span more than 14 days for performance reasons elaborated on below. VM copy - creates a master image to clone additional VMs from an existing VM. VM backup - provides disaster recovery from file corruption or deletion. Each of these methods is discussed below to ensure that you are able to backup and recover your data in the most efficient and appropriate way. VM snapshot When you create a VM snapshot, you grab a VM and all its data and configuration at a specific point in time (a snapshot). This is achieved by locking the main image of the VM, writing all subsequent updates, creations or deletions to a separate file (a delta) outside of your main image. Use case When planning to deploy a kernel upgrade in Linux, take a snapshot prior to performing the upgrade. When you have applied and successfully tested the upgrade, you should remove the snapshot. If the upgrade is not successful or does not pass the quality check, you can simply rollback the changes by reverting to the snapshot. Pros You are able to complete this task autonomously, without intervention by UKCloud. You can create a temporary recovery point while the VM is still running and then quickly rollback from any changes or updates made to the VM, should undesirable outcomes occur (for example, during a Windows Update). Cons You can create only one snapshot for each VM, with each subsequent snapshot overwriting the previous one. You should use snapshots only as a temporary solution, as the longer the snapshot is running, the more changes will be lost should the snapshot be restored. In addition, due to the way that snapshots capture all changes to a separate file, storage costs will increase as a result of having to store both the original master VM image and you may also encounter a negative impact to the overall performance of the VM. How to create a VM snapshot You can create a VM snapshot within the UKCloud vCloud Director Control Panel by right-clicking the VM that you want to create a snapshot for and selecting Create Snapshot . VM copy When you copy a VM, you create an exact replica of the VM in either the same vApp or a different vApp. Use case When creating a web application that can scale across multiple VMs of the same configuration, you can build an image to the required specification and then copy that VM to create a master image (gold build). When required, you can deploy subsequent VMs from this gold build in a consistent fashion, enabling swift scaling of your environment. Pros You can easily create a gold build of VMs, thereby creating one image that you can then use to create additional VMs in a controlled and consistent fashion, without having to build each VM completely from scratch. Cons You must power down the VM prior to taking a copy. Each additional copy will consume as much storage as the original and consume additional memory and CPU cycles while the VMs are running. How to create a VM copy You can create a VM copy within the UKCloud vCloud Director Control Panel by right-clicking the VM that you want to copy and selecting Copy to . VM backup You should view backup as a disaster recovery mechanism, whereby you can restore entire environments or individual files in the event of the original becoming unavailable as a result of corruption or accidental deletion. You can add any VM to the automated snapshot backup schedule so that it is automatically backed up on a daily basis. You can choose to retain snapshot backups for either 14 or 28 days. Data is backed up at the hypervisor level and provides a crash‑consistent image. Use case If you accidentally delete or amend a file that should not be modified, you can restore the file in question from backup by raising a Service Request via the UKCloud Portal. Pros You gain peace of mind that data is backed up nightly for a rolling period of 14 or 28 days without any manual intervention. Cons Time taken for a restoration request to be completed (dependent on the amount of data to be restored). How to add a VM to the automated snapshot backup schedule For information about how to add a VM to the automated backup schedule, see How to manage snapshot protection for your VMs in the Knowledge Centre.

    "keywords": "Availability of Virtual Hardware version 11 Q. What does Virtual Hardware v11 provide? Virtual Hardware v11 enables UKCloud to support increased CPU limits and memory, but primarily it introduces new guest OS support as follows: Debian 8. x Solaris 11.2 Asanux 4 SP4 Ubuntu 12.04.5/14.04.1 Oracle Linux 7 FreeBSD 9.3 MAC OSX 10.10 Windows 2016 Q. When do these changes take effect? UKCloud has already enabled these upgrades internally on our UKCloud for VMware platform. The newer virtual hardware version is already available in regions 5 and 6. Regions 1, 2, 7 and 8 will be available for customers by the end of Q3 2018. Any new VMs will, by default, be created with the updated virtual hardware version; clients are able to specifically select an earlier hardware version at the point of VM creation. Any existing VMs and templates will continue to use their currently configured virtual hardware version until such time as customers select to change this. Any clones/copies of VMs or templates will retain the same virtual hardware version as the source image. Prior to upgrading the Virtual Hardware version the following should be noted: You cannot downgrade the hardware version of the virtual machines in a vApp The vApp/VMs must be stopped and its virtual machines must have the latest version of VMware Tools installed. Q. How do I manually upgrade the Virtual Hardware version of my VM? Log into the UKCloud Portal and access vCloud Director Click My Cloud. In the left pane, click VMs. Select a virtual machine, right-click, and select Upgrade Virtual Hardware Version. Click Yes. Q. Are there precautions I need to be aware of? The update of CPU features may result in some operating systems being reconfigured on their next reboot. We advise that customers monitor the first reboot of any VMs to ensure any OS configuration changes apply correctly.

    "title": "Getting Started Guide for Cloud Storage | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for Cloud Storage Introduction UKCloud's Cloud Storage service is an object storage solution based on Dell EMC Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS). Access is via a RESTful application programming interface (API), which also provides support for Amazon's S3 API. This Getting Started Guide covers the tasks you need to perform to get Cloud Storage up and running in your environment. It also looks at common use cases for API‑based object storage within web applications and provides information about some command-line tools that you can use to interact with the storage APIs. Intended audience This guide is intended for users who want to learn more about UKCloud's Cloud Storage service. Cloud Storage overview Cloud Storage: Is a secure and highly adaptable storage platform designed to address a wide variety of use cases Is based on object storage technology that is natively optimised for cloud storage in terms of scale, resilience and accessibility Removes the complexity of capacity management by utilising a pay‑as‑you‑go model, so you pay for what you use, when you use it, scaling indefinitely and on demand Natively enables application deduplication and redundancy to ensure the highest level of data availability, while reducing the cost and management of on-premises storage solutions Provides easy access to storage anywhere, any time, to any device, using HTTP(S) to simplify the integration of object storage systems into cloud‑based solutions by removing the need to rely on the availability of web, file or FTP servers Offloads objects (files, media, images) from compute resources, reducing the load on server resources Automatically replicates and distributes objects to give high levels of data durability and availability, eliminating the need for cloud backup and recovery ECS provides two APIs that you can use to manage your cloud storage: the S3‑compatible API and the EMC ECS Atmos API. Note If you write content to cloud storage using one of the APIs, you cannot subsequently access that content using the other API. Choose carefully which API you want to use before beginning a project, as it will be difficult to move between them. The key differences between the two APIs are: The ECS S3-compatible API enables you to easily migrate applications between Atmos, S3 and other S3‑compatible storage; but not all functionality available in S3 is available on ECS as shown in the S3 Supported Features chapter of the Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS) Data Access Guide ). The ECS Atmos API provides backward compatibility with the EMC Atmos platform. It offers access to the majority of the features of the platform with certain exceptions as listed in the Atmos Supported Features chapter of the Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS) Data Access Guide . Cloud Storage use cases The low cost of cloud storage per GB, as well as its almost unlimited scalability, means there's a large variety of use cases for it. For example, it's ideal for data archives, backups, log files, and media repositories. We anticipate that most web applications can make good use of cloud storage for static content, such as images and downloadable binaries. Storing these items in cloud storage—rather than in primary storage attached to web servers, inside the database or on a traditional file share—can provide significant benefits in terms of cost savings, agility and performance. For example, with an internet-facing application that enables users to download forms and guides in PDF, these items are often stored in primary storage attached to the web servers, which creates several challenges: Whenever a PDF is updated, the updated copy must be replicated to all web servers When an item is downloaded, the bandwidth usage of the web server in question increases Multiple simultaneous downloads could overload the web servers or other components of the network infrastructure Each object is stored multiple times in primary storage, increasing the overall cost of storage On the other hand, storing this content in cloud storage overcomes these challenges because: Only one copy of each item is stored, so updates only need to be made in one place End users connect directly to cloud storage to download PDFs, bypassing the web servers and associated network infrastructure Objects are stored only once, and at a much lower price per GB, which substantially reduces the overall cost of storage The same principles apply to other static content, such as images and (especially) videos. The more workload you can offload onto an external system such as cloud storage, the leaner your application infrastructure can become. There are often questions around how best to implement this. Ultimately, it's up to the application developers, but a popular approach is as follows: Handle content uploads and creation on the web servers. Perform any required modifications or transformations using on-demand processing servers (usually from a message queue). Write the content into cloud storage, storing the resulting object IDs, external URLs and any other relevant metadata in the application database. This process provides a relatively simple transition to cloud storage. The application still knows about all the objects, but rather than retrieving, for example, a relative path for an item from the database, its entire URL is retrieved, pointing to cloud storage. Before you begin When you request your Cloud Storage service, UKCloud Support creates a namespace in the specified account. If you have requested an Atmos subtenant, this is also created. To create S3 buckets, use any S3-compliant tool. To create additional namespaces or Atmos subtenants, you must raise a service request. You can have S3 buckets and Atmos subtentants in the same namespace. Cloud Storage provides different API endpoints to access your storage, depending on the UKCloud site and connectivity type you are using. Make sure you use the correct endpoint to ensure the best possible performance for your solution. S3 API endpoint Atmos API endpoint Corsham (Assured) Internet cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com atmos.cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com PSN Assured cas.cor00005.psnassured.ukcloud.com atmos.cas.cor00005.psnassured.ukcloud.com N3 cas.cor00005.ukcloud.thirdparty.nhs.uk/ atmos.cas.cor00005.ukcloud.thirdparty.nhs.uk/ Farnborough (Assured) Internet cas.frn00006.ukcloud.com atmos.cas.frn00006.ukcloud.com PSN Assured cas.frn00006.psnassured.ukcloud.com atmos.cas.frn00006.psnassured.ukcloud.com N3 cas.frn00006.ukcloud.thirdparty.nhs.uk/ atmos.cas.frn00006.ukcloud.thirdparty.nhs.uk/ If you're using the ENHANCED option (geo-resilient storage), you can use either the Corsham or Farnborough endpoints. In the event of a site failure, there will be an outage to objects created on the failed site. UKCloud will bring these objects online in the other site within about 15 minutes. Contact UKCloud support if you are unsure which endpoint to use. Using the ECS S3-compatible API The S3-compatible API is at: https://<api_endpoint> Check which api_endpoint to use in Before you begin , for example: https://cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com To help get you started, you can find developer resources on the Amazon web site at: https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/s3/ For details of the supported and unsupported S3 operations on ECS, see: https://www.emc.com/techpubs/ecs/ecs_s3_supported_features-1.htm You may also find the Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS) Data Access Guide useful: https://www.emc.com/collateral/TechnicalDocument/docu79368.pdf Note Currently the N3 DNS service does not allow UKCloud to create wildcard DNS entries for our services. This means that S3 URLs that feature the bucket as part of the domain do not work (for example, bucket01.cas.frn00006.ukcloud.thirdparty.nhs.uk ). With most S3 tools, you can choose whether to use prefix buckets or suffix buckets. If you are using the service via N3 you'll need to make sure your client tools support suffix buckets. Amazon S3 Authentication Tool for Curl The Amazon S3 Authentication Tool for Curl (S3Curl) is a very useful Perl script, developed by Amazon. It's a wrapper for Curl that calculates the required authentication signature automatically for each request. As the authentication signature changes for every request, this allows Curl to interact with the API outside of code, enabling you to validate that your commands are working correctly and view the raw HTML response from the API, which can be useful when troubleshooting. For more information about S3Curl, see http://aws.amazon.com/code/128 . To use S3Curl: Download S3Curl from the following location: https://github.com/UKCloud/s3curl Install the following required dependency: sudo apt-get install libdigest-hmac-perl yum install perl-Digest-HMAC Create a file named .s3curl in the home directory containing your credentials. For example: %awsSecretAccessKeys = ( UKCloud => { id => '<user_id>', key => '<secret_key>', }, ); Where: user_id is your User ID (you can find this in the Storage section of the UKCloud Portal) secret_key is your secret key (If you've forgotten or don't know your secret key, you can reset it in the Storage section of the UKCloud Portal) Change the permissions, otherwise the Perl script will refuse to run. chmod 600 .s3curl Make the following small modification to the script itself so that it will work correctly with ECS: Open the s3curl.pl file in your preferred editor (for example, vim or nano). Scroll down until you find the following comment: # begin customizing here The S3 endpoints are defined below this line, so add your Cloud Storage host name to this list as follows: my @endpoints = ('<api_endpoint>', 's3.amazonaws.com', ... For example: #begin customizing here my @endpoints = ('cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com', 's3.amazonaws.com', ... Save the file. S3Curl is now ready to use, so you can call it as follows: perl s3curl.pl --id UKCloud -- <curl_arguments> The curl_arguments need to contain the host name and port number. For example, to list your buckets, you could use: perl s3curl.pl --id UKCloud -- https://cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com/ Or to delete a file named Lighthouse.jpg in /bucket2 : perl s3curl.pl --id UKCloud -- -X DELETE https://cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com/bucket2/Lighthouse.jpg Using the ECS Atmos API The Atmos API is at: https://<api_endpoint> Check which api_endpoint to use in Before you begin , for example: https://atmos.cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com To help get you started, download the appropriate Atmos SDK from the following location: https://community.emc.com/docs/DOC-27910 The SDK provides bindings for all popular languages, as well as some quick start guides. You can find the full API reference in the EMC Atmos Programmer's Guide , which you can download from the following location (or the UKCloud Knowledge Centre): https://www.emc.com/collateral/TechnicalDocument/docu68370.pdf For details of the supported and unsupported Atmos operations on ECS, see: https://www.emc.com/techpubs/ecs/ecs_atmos_supported_features-1.htm You may also find the Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS) Data Access Guide useful: https://www.emc.com/collateral/TechnicalDocument/docu79368.pdf Using a command-line interface Interacting with Cloud Storage via the API directly is ideal for web-based applications, but having access from the command line can help developers with testing and provide scripting access to Cloud Storage. Command‑line interface (CLI) tools enable access from the command line by translating commands into the relevant API calls. There are lots of CLI tools to choose from --- this guide examines two for the S3 API: one each for Linux and Windows. Remember that the APIs are not interchangeable, so if you use the Atmos API in your application, you won't be able to see the data using the S3 CLI. Using S3cmd --- a Linux CLI for the S3 API S3cmd is an open-source tool for Linux, written in Python. To use S3cmd: Download and extract the S3cmd files from the following location: http://s3tools.org/download Create the required configuration files by running the following command: s3cmd ---configure When prompted, provide the following information: Access Key --- your User ID (you can find this in the Storage section of the UKCloud Portal) Secret Key --- your secret key (If you've forgotten or don't know your secret key, you can reset it in the Storage section of the UKCloud Portal) Encryption password --- create a secure password Path to GPG program --- as appropriate for your system Use HTTPS protocol --- Yes You'll be prompted to test the connection. After the test, even if it fails, save the configuration, which will be written to ~/.s3cfg . Edit the ~/.s3cfg file and confirm that the host_base and host_bucket lines look like the following: host_base = <api_endpoint> host_bucket = %(bucket)s.<api_endpoint> Note Ensure that you use the appropriate api_endpoint , as shown in Before you begin , for example: host_base = cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com host_bucket = %(bucket)s.cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com Save the file. The S3cmd tool is now ready to use. To list your buckets, run the following command: s3cmd ls You can find detailed instructions for using the tool in the accompanying README file. Using S3Express--- a Windows CLI for the S3 API S3Express is a lightweight command-line tool for Windows that is self-contained in a single executable. It's a licensed product, with free trials also available. To use S3Express: Download and install the S3Express files from the following location: http://www.s3express.com/ Use the following commands to configure the tool to access Cloud Storage: saveauth <user_id> <secret_key> UKCloud setopt --endpoint:<api_endpoint> Where: user_id is your User ID (you can find this in the Storage section of the UKCloud Portal) secret_key is your secret key (if you've forgotten or don't know your secret key, you can reset it in the Storage section of the UKCloud Portal) api_endpoint is the appropriate endpoint, as shown in Before you begin , for example: setopt --endpoint:cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com The S3Express tool is now ready to use. To list your buckets, run the following command: ls For detailed instructions, refer to the Windows help file, which is installed along with the tool. Working with Cloud Storage in the UKCloud Portal Although you will mostly interact with your Cloud Storage service through the API, the UKCloud Portal provides access to some information about your service. Within the UKCloud Portal, you can: View information about the namespaces within your Cloud Storage environment, including: How many buckets are in each namespace Storage consumed by each namespace View a list of users with access to the namespace Reset the secret key for a user View information about the buckets within a namespace, including: API Type: Atmos or S3 Storage consumed by the bucket Number of objects in the bucket View a graphical representation of the storage consumed by a bucket over the last 30 days More information! How to view Cloud Storage information in the UKCloud Portal To access your Cloud Storage service in the UKCloud Portal: Log in to the UKCloud Portal and select your account. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal . In the Portal navigation panel, expand the Cloud Storage option and select ECS . You can now browse the namespaces, buckets and users in your Cloud Storage service. Next steps In this Getting Started Guide, you've learned the basics about the Cloud Storage service.

    "title": "Getting Started Guide for the Cross Domain Security Zone Walled Garden | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for the Cross Domain Security Zone Walled Garden Overview The UKCloud Walled Garden provides self-service access to the Cross Domain Security Zone (CDSZ) so that you can design, implement and manage your own cross‑domain solution, using technology and application services of your choice. UKCloud provides an assurance wrap by managing firewalls between the security domains and ensuring you use appropriate risk management to understand and mitigate identified risks. The Walled Garden is ideal if you require more control and flexibility over what is passed between security domains, to support a wider range of use cases. This guide covers the steps you need to follow to get your Walled Garden up and running. Intended audience This guide is intended for customers who have: Completed the CDSZ Walled Garden assurance wrap Been approved to have a Base Implementation of the Walled Garden to allow data to pass between the Assured and Elevated security domains on the UKCloud platform Before you begin Before you can start to implement a walled garden, you must have completed and passed the appropriate application process. For more information, see the UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone application process . After your Walled Garden application has been approved, a service request is raised to implement the Walled Garden virtual data centre (VDC) and, if necessary, Elevated and Assured VDCs. Note If a service request for this implementation already exists, the existing request is used and a new one is not raised. You can track the progress of the service request in the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. During the provisioning of the Walled Garden service, we'll ask you for some additional information via the service request: The customer account in which you would like the Walled Garden VDC to be provisioned, if different from the customer completing the Walled Garden application. Whether you plan to have a single or dual site solution. How many VDCs you need to be set up in each security domain. If you're connecting new or existing VDCs to the Walled Garden VDC. If you're connecting to existing VDCs, we'll need to know information such as NFT details, customer account, and so on. The external source IP addresses from which you'd like to access the Assured VDC (up to a maximum of 50). These IP addresses are the locations from which you can build and test the environment (for example, offices or end user premises). The build phase of the Walled Garden environment can take up to 10 working days depending on the complexity of the deployment. When the environment has been fully provisioned, your Customer Success Manager (CSM) will send you the information you need to access it. Building your Walled Garden service As soon as you have access to your environment, you can start to build your Walled Garden services. You then have 42 calendar days to: Complete the provisioning of the virtual machines (VMs) and networking Complete an IT Health Check Present your evidence pack to the customer and UKCloud SIROs It is important to remember that while the UKCloud Portal for the Assured security domain is accessible from the internet, the Portal for the Elevated security domain and Walled Garden services is accessible only through the PSN Protected network or through UKCloud's Secure Remote Access (SRA) service. Setting up your networking First, you need to replicate the networking that you set out in your Walled Garden application diagrams. This involves the creation of external and internal networking, as well as the creation of rules on the virtual firewall within your environment. For information about creating networks and firewall rules, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware and How to build a virtual machine with UKCloud for VMware . You also need to create the rules that allow connectivity between the different VDCs through the Walled Garden. This involves the creation of firewall rules, static routes and/or NAT rules. Networking examples There are two options for networking between the VDCs in the Walled Garden service: Option 1: Create static routes between the VDCs; this is the simplest option for connecting VDCs Option 2: Use NAT rules on top of the static routes; this option may be appropriate if you want to abstract the static routes The diagrams below provide examples for both options. Note For both options: You cannot route public IP addresses to the vCNS Edges in the Walled Garden The Org VDC networks 192.168.XXX.XX in the examples below are illustrative and you should replace these with your own details You must have one VM in the Walled Garden VDC connecting to both vCNS Edges Each of the examples below assumes that the appropriate firewall rules are in place You must apply an SNAT rule in the Elevated security domain to enable connectivity to UKCloud services Building your virtual machines The next step is to build the VMs that you outlined in the Walled Garden application. This involves deploying the VMs from either the vCloud Director catalog or from template VMs as OVF files. The VMs must be able to access UKCloud services, such as OS repositories, the network time server, the Key Management Server (KMS), and so on. You may also need to access external services, such as antivirus repositories. You must configure this access in your VDC networking. For more information about creating VMs and accessing UKCloud services, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware . Testing your environment When you've built your VMs and networking, you can start to test the environment. If you've configured the networking correctly, your VMs should be able to talk to each other across the Walled Garden. If you have any issues, check your network rules. Performing the IT Health Check As part of the Base Implementation, you're required to conduct an IT Health Check (ITHC) of the environment. The ITHC must be conducted by an independent CHECK Service Provider, approved and classified as Green Light by the National Cyber Security Centre (NSCS). You can search for appropriate providers on the NSCS web site . Before beginning the ITHC, notify UKCloud by raising a service request in My Calls and completing the External Security Review Test (ESRT) application form . Ideally, we require five working days' notice before the work is due to be carried out. The ITHC scope should be relevant to the environment. For example, if you're using the Walled Garden to pull application and antivirus updates from the internet, then security controls relevant to facilitate this should be in scope. Bear in mind that the end customer accreditor may dictate the scope of the ITHC. Presenting your results When you've conducted your ITHC, with no results higher than Medium, present your evidence pack to the UKCloud SIRO. The evidence pack comprises the Walled Garden assurance wrap form and the following, as detailed in sections (a) to (c) in section 3.7 of the Walled Garden assurance wrap form: (a) Evidence of protective monitoring aligning with the 12 Protective Monitoring Controls (PMCs) in Good Practice Guide 13 (GPG13). The protective monitoring will need to span both sides of the Walled Garden as well as the Walled Garden itself. You can provide this by explaining how each of the PMCs is met by the protective monitoring solution in place. (b) The ITHC results, with no risks higher than a Medium. If you do have results higher than a Medium but you have put a remediation plan in place that has been accepted by the end customer accreditor, then we may accept this depending on the issues raised. (c) An approval statement confirming that the end customer accreditor is satisfied with the overall security regime and is happy for the solution to be live. If the information provided in the Walled Garden evidence pack is acceptable, the UKCloud SIRO signs off the Live Implementation and any restrictions that have been imposed on the environment by UKCloud Customer Service are lifted.

    "title": "UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone application process | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone application process Overview The UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone (CDSZ) enables you to securely transfer data between our Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL security domains using NCSC-approved cross-domain security patterns. Using the CDSZ you can create applications that are accessible to citizens, but ensure data safety. This document provides an overview of the UKCloud process to be used by customers wanting to purchase CDSZ services (UKCloud Guard, Walled Garden and Secure Remote Access). There are two approaches to applying for CDSZ services: A light touch design review/self-assessment route for customers with simple implementations, or those who are experienced at designing secure solutions. This enables customers who are comfortable with the risk associated with their data to choose which controls and evidence they feel is appropriate to self-certify their cross domain solution. An assurance wrap style approach with UKCloud’s experienced professionals for more complex implementations or those customers who would like support and guidance when developing their solutions. This enables customers who require more support to submit their proposed solution with confidence that it effectively mitigates against risk. In this document, the customer is the UKCloud customer, who may or may not be the ultimate end user of the application. The customer will be responsible for completing any compliance process with the end user, including obtaining sign-off from the relevant data owner. The data owner should be a permanent employee at the data owning organisation with evidence of data ownership, for example an IT Security Officer (ITSO), Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO) or accreditor. The data owner can choose to sign off for a single CDSZ implementation or setup a Tell Us Once agreement that signs off all future CDSZ implementations for the customer on behalf of the data owning organisation. UKCloud will maintain a list of all Tell Us Once agreements and any subsequent CDSZ applications by the customer on behalf of the data owner should reference this agreement. Process overview The following table provides more detail about each stage: Stage Name Description 1 Initial Contact Customer contacts UKCloud to register interest in CDSZ service. This can be through My Calls or direct contact with a Sales representative, Technical Account Manager (TAM) or Cloud Architect. 2a Self-Assessment Customer creates document pack to illustrate the solution design and provide evidence that all necessary sign-offs and compliance have been obtained. 2b Assurance Wrap Review Customer creates document pack with assistance from the UKCloud compliance team and Cloud Architect. 3 Design Review Customer presents the technical solution to Cloud Architect for advice and feedback. 4 Application Submission Customer raises a Service Request and submits document pack. 5 Service Implementation UKCloud provisions service and customer implements their solution. 6 On-Going Compliance UKCloud annually prompts customer to review existing document pack and provide updated information for any changes to design or approvals. Required documents When you apply for a CDSZ service, you must provide the following documents to show that you have identified and mitigated for any risks: Details of your proposed implementation that covers the intended design in the CDSZ, the Assured and Elevated VDCs you are connecting to and data flows. Evidence (for example, email or signed document) of acceptance of risk from the data owning organisation. This should also indicate if this acceptance is a Tell Us Once agreement that will also apply to future CDSZ implementations by the customer on behalf of the data owner. Note If a Tell Us Once agreement is already in place between the customer and the data owner, this evidence is not required, but the customer should indicate that such an agreement is in place so that UKCloud can confirm against our list of trusted partners for the data owner. An explicit statement, as part of the Service Request, that the solution has been reviewed by a named UKCloud Cloud Architect or that you do not require a review. The named Cloud Architect must provide review notes as evidence that the review took place. See Stage 3: Design review . If you're connecting to a PSN Protected enabled VDC, proof of PSN compliance (a copy of PSN CoCo or PSN CoP). Stage 1: Initial contact If you want to use the CDSZ, you can initiate the application process in one of two ways: Raise a Service Request through My Calls, specifying the relevant CDSZ product (UKCloud Guard, Walled Garden or Secure Remote Access). One of our Sales representatives, TAMs, or Cloud Architects will arrange a call to discuss your requirements and then close the Service Request. Contact one of our Sales representatives, TAMs, or Cloud Architects directly to arrange a call to discuss your requirements. During your initial conversation, our Cloud Architect will discuss your proposed implementation and help determine the best approach for your situation: If your implementation is simple, or you're confident with designing a solution that mitigates the risk associated with your data and choosing the controls and evidence appropriate to that solution, you can follow our self-assessment option. If your implementation is complex, or you'd prefer some guidance to identify risks and how to mitigate against them, we can provide an assurance wrap style approach with our experienced professionals for more complex implementations. The following table lists some examples of simple versus complex designs: Criteria Simple Complex Business case Common use cases, aligned with Government Digital Strategy. Use cases where no precedent has been established. Multi-tenant solutions. Technical architecture Standard architecture compliant with NCSC design patterns or UKCloud published blueprints. Deviations from established models or blueprints. Non-fully virtualised solutions, for example with elements of hosting within our Cloud Enablement service. Risk ownership Clear accreditation by a single recognised SIRO within a UK public sector organisation. Shared accreditation. Accreditation by private sector authority. Stage 2a: Self-assessment If you choose to self-assess your implementation, you must gather all the documents listed in Required Documents. With self-assessment, you can still request a design review from one of our Cloud Architects. See Stage 3: Design review . Stage 2b: Assurance wrap review If you choose an assurance wrap review for your proposed implementation, the UKCloud compliance team and Cloud Architects will work with you to help identify risks to your solution. This includes: Review of design and data flow with a Cloud Architect (see Stage 3: Design review ) Advice and guidance for how to design secure solutions with appropriate monitoring and logging Conversation between UKCloud SIRO and customer SIRO or nominated representative covering risk management and mitigation, with further workshops if required Review of customer-defined ITHC scope and summary with a Cloud Architect Note UKCloud takes no ownership or responsibility for the implementation or running of your proposed solution or ownership for any risks to the data. Note UKCloud reserves the right to charge SFIA day rate charges for time spent on customer projects if you disengage with the assurance wrap review process before completion. At the end of the review period, you will have generated all the necessary documents to apply for your CDSZ service (as listed in Required documents ). Stage 3: Design review The design review is facilitated by a Cloud Architect and will gather a clearer understanding of how the proposed design aligns with recognised good security practice. Present your technical solution to a Cloud Architect. You can do this via teleconference, Webex or face-to-face as appropriate. The Cloud Architect will be looking to see evidence of effective mitigation for common risks (for example, technical controls like firewall, anti-malware and protective monitoring). The Cloud Architect will provide advice and guidance on aspects of the solution that are likely to raise concerns. You may revise your design to incorporate feedback from the design review. Note If you are self-assessing your proposed implementation, this stage is optional but you must provide a statement in your document pack indicating that you do not require a review. Stage 4: Application submission Raise a Service Request specifying the relevant CDSZ product (UKCloud Guard, Walled Garden or Secure Remote Access) and attach all the required documents , as well as any review notes from the assurance wrap review. This request will then be assigned to a UKCloud representative to verify that all required information has been provided. If any documents are missing or empty, a UKCloud representative will contact you to ensure that all required documents are provided before the service is provisioned. Stage 5: Service implementation When the assigned UKCloud representative has determined that all the appropriate information has been provided, the requested CDSZ service will be provisioned within five working days. When your service has been provisioned, you can implement your proposed solution. Stage 6: On-going compliance On an annual basis, UKCloud requires evidence of on-going compliance. You will be contacted by your Technical Account Manager (TAM) to review the existing documents and inform us if any of the details or approvals have changed. If you're connecting to a PSN Protected enabled VDC, proof of PSN compliance (a copy of PSN CoCo or PSN CoP) must be provided on a yearly basis. Once the relevant PSN certificate (if required) is provided, and provided there are no changes the original design, your CDSZ service will continue without interruption. If, after examination of the existing documents, you identify that there have been changes, for example if the design has changed from the initial solution or there is a different data owner approver, it is your responsibility to submit a revised evidence pack within 15 days. A UKCloud representative will contact you to discuss your changes.

    "keywords": "Managing your UKCloud for VMware environment using the UKCloud Portal API With the development of the UKCloud for VMware service for G‑Cloud 8, we've introduced some changes to the architecture underpinning the platform. The change in architecture introduces the concept of sites, regions and zones to enable you to design resilience into your solutions in a way that works best for you. Sites will be a familiar concept if you're already on the UKCloud platform. We have two sites, one in Corsham and one in Farnborough, creating the ability to deploy disaster‑resilient solutions across two geographically disparate locations. Regions are a new concept in UKCloud for VMware. Within each site we have independent regions, enabling you to create resilient solutions within a single site, allowing for protection such as synchronous replication between applications or databases. A region is made up of zones . A zone typically relates to a single service, and there is usually only one service zone per region. However, in the case of UKCloud for VMware, there may be multiple UKCloud for VMware zones in a single region, enabling you to build up services that are underpinned by different compute and storage but the same network. For more information, see Understanding sites, regions and zones . When managing the platform through the Portal API, if you've designed your solution across multiple regions, you must use different credentials for each environment that you're managing. Also, because each region has its own management instance, you must use the API endpoints that apply specifically to the region. This is important to remember so that you call the correct endpoints if your solution is deployed across multiple regions. You can find out which endpoints to use by clicking your username in the top right corner of the UKCloud Portal home page and selecting API: Using the API page to find the correct API URL for each region: Feedback If you have any comments on this document or any other aspect of your UKCloud experience, send them to products@ukcloud.com ."

    "title": "How to migrate your workloads between UKCloud regions | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to migrate your workloads between UKCloud regions Overview Journaling Protection is a powerful, self-service replication and recovery tool that can help you improve your organisational resilience. However, you can also use UKCloud's Journaling Protection solution to migrate your UKCloud for VMware applications into another UKCloud for VMware-enabled zone. This enables you to move your workloads into the regions within the UKCloud platform that are best suited for their requirements. Our Migration service is powered by Zerto, a leading provider of disaster recovery software for the cloud. The migration of VMs within the UKCloud platform is very closely aligned to the disaster recovery of VMs within UKCloud; the small difference being that when you have failed-over the VMs from one region into another, you don't then failback to your primary region. As such, you'll find that the articles linked to from this article refer to disaster recovery and failover, however the steps also apply to migration. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide, you need to have access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal. Before you begin When you request Journaling Protection to migrate a workload within the UKCloud platform, UKCloud provides you with: A ZORG ID to identify your environment within Zerto Access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal (ZSSP), where you can create and manage your VPGs You should consider the following: Migration is provided on a vApp basis (not for individual VMs). This is worth considering if you intend to migrate only some parts of your vApps. VMs must be powered on to be synchronised prior to migration. Our Journaling Protection service option captures every action. When a VM is deleted from your vApp, the associated journal is also deleted. This means if you delete a VM before migrating it, that VM will not exist in your target region. We provide a single default service profile. The details of this are available in the Journaling Protection Service Scope . We do not currently provide the option for you to create custom profiles Migrating workloads between UKCloud regions You begin the migration process for your VMs by adding Journaling Protection to the vApp that contains those VMs. This creates something called a virtual protection group (VPG). Each VM in the protected vApp is synchronised to the target migration region and a journal is created. After this initial synchronisation, each subsequent write operation to the VM is processed as normal on the source region and a copy is asynchronously sent to the target region and written to the journal. Each journal entry exists in the journal for a specified number of days (the journal history). When the journal history is reached, as new journal entries are created, older entries are written to the migration target VM's virtual disks. Every few seconds, a checkpoint is written to every journal for each VM in the VPG to ensure crash-consistency between the VMs. When you're ready to migrate a VM, you select a checkpoint to recover to. This isn't strictly necessary for workload migration, but is a feature associated with the Journaling Protection aspect of Zerto. It means that you'll have a known point at which the VM will be restarted from in the new region. During migration, the vApp and its VMs are created on the target region and the recovery disks for each VM are attached to the migrated VM. Information in the journal is then promoted to the VM to bring it up to the date and time of the selected checkpoint. The process for getting Journaling Protection up and running ready for workload migration within the UKCloud platform is as follows: Create a migration VDC Configure networking in the migration target VDC Create a virtual protection group in the primary region Perform a test migration Migrate your workloads Create a migration VDC To migrate your workloads to a different UKCloud region, you must have a VDC in the intended target region. If you already have a compute service in the target region, you can use an existing VDC or you can create a new one using: The UKCloud Portal - For more information see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware The UKCloud Portal API -- For more information see How to use the UKCloud Portal API If you don't already have a compute service in the target region or you'd prefer UKCloud to create the VDC for you, you can request this as part of your Journaling Protection service request. Configure networking in the migration target VDC You must configure any internally and externally routed networks in your migration target environment to duplicate those in the source region. You must also configure the edge gateway with the same firewall, NAT and other rules. You'll create the mapping between these networks when you create your VPG; see How to create a virtual protection group . When you initially migrate your workloads, external access to the target region will be via a different IP address. If you want to keep the same IP addresses for your new environment, you'll need to request an IP move from UKCloud. We'll move the IPs from your old edge to your new edge. Note that you should raise this service request in good time so we can move the IPs as soon as you need us to. Alternatively, you can use the new allocation of IP addresses in your new environment. You don't need to configure vApp networks in advance as they'll be replicated within the VPG. Create a virtual protection group in the primary region A VPG is a collection of VMs that are grouped together for migration. As workload migration within the UKCloud platform uses Journaling Protection, VPGs are created from vApps. When you create a VPG, you specify the vApp you want to migrate and all the VMs in that vApp are replicated. For example, in a standard three-tier application, you'll likely have three VMs: one for your application, one for the database and one for the web server. As best practice, you should create these three related VMs in a single vApp, which you can then add to a VPG so that all the VMs are migrated together. For more information, see How to create a virtual protection group . This guide is the same for both failovers and migrations. Perform a test migration After you create your VPG, we recommend that you perform a test migration to confirm that your VMs will be recovered correctly when you do the real migration. For more information, see How to perform a failover . This guide is the same for both failovers and migrations. Migrate your workloads If you are happy with your test migration, you can now choose when to migrate your environment from your primary region into your new region. You don't have to migrate everything in one go; you can choose which VPGs you migrate and you can perform a staged migration. Within Zerto, you have two options for migrating your workloads: Move the VPG to the target region. This method performs and end-to-end migration, including removing the VMs from the source region after they've been moved. For more information, see the steps below. Perform a live migration. This method provides more flexibility for you to control what happens in the primary region after you move the VMs to the target region. For more information, see How to perform a failover . To move a VPG: Log in to ZSSP. If you need more detailed instructions, see How to access the Zerto Self-Service Portal . Use the ZSSP login link for the zone in which your target VDC is located. From the ACTIONS menu at the bottom of the page, choose MOVE VPG . In the Move wizard, on the Select VPGs page, select one or more VPGs that you want to move then click NEXT . On the EXECUTION PARAMETERS page, the commit policy gives you the opportunity to check the integrity of the migrated VMs before committing the move. To change the commit policy, select the Commit Policy field and choose: Auto-Commit if you want to automatically commit the move after a specified amount of time if there is no user interaction. Set the amount of time in the After field, up to a maximum of 1440 minutes (24 hours). If you want the move to be immediately committed, enter 0. Auto-Rollback if you want to automatically roll back the move after a specified amount of time if there is no user interaction. Set the amount of time in the After field, up to a maximum of 1440 minutes (24 hours). If you want the move to be immediately rolled back, enter 0. None if you do not want to apply a commit policy. You must manually commit or roll back the move. The source VMs must be powered off before they can be migrated. If the VMs cannot be gracefully shut down, you can force a shutdown. To force shutdown, select the Force Shutdown check box. If you do not select this option and the VMs cannot be gracefully shut down, the move process fails. Reverse protection ensures that when the source VMs are migrated to the target region, the source region becomes the new target region. Reverse protection is enabled by default, but you should disable it by clicking the Reverse Protection field and deselecting the REVERSE check box. Click NEXT . On the MOVE page, review the diagram to see the number of VPGs and VMs included in the move and where they will be moved to, then click START MOVE . The move process creates the VMs in the target region. Note If a VM already exists on the target region with the same name as one of the source VMs, a number is added to the end of the target VM name to ensure that it is unique. If you set a commit policy with a time greater than zero, you can check the integrity of the migrated VMs before committing (or rolling back) the migration. When you've finished testing, you can either wait for the time to elapse before the auto commit or auto rollback, or on the VPGs tab, click the VPG Name and then click the Commit or Rollback icon as required. After the migrated VMs are up and running and committed in the target region, the powered off VMs in the source region are removed from the source region and data from the journal is promoted to the migrated VMs. You should have disabled reverse protection to stop your migrated VMs from being protected on the source region. Next steps After you've completed the migration, you can continue working with your applications as before. If you used failover to migrate your workloads, when you've determined that the migration has been successful, you should remove the original VMs from the source region to remove any workloads that are no longer required. You can use Journaling Protection to protect your newly migrated VMs by replicating to another region within UKCloud. Note While you can set up Journaling Protection for migration purposes in regions 1 and 2, the target environment for Journaling Protection for failover is available only in regions 5 and 6.

    "keywords": "How to create a virtual protection group Overview A virtual protection group (VPG) is a collection of virtual machines (VMs) that are grouped together for some purpose, for example data protection, disaster recovery or workload migration. When you create a VPG, a replica virtual disk is created on the target site (for recovery or migration) for each VM in the VPG. These replica disks are then populated with the data in the source VMs by synchronising the VMs with the target site replicas. After the initial synchronisation completes, any writes to disk from the VMs in the source site are sent to the target site. These writes are stored in the target site in journals. Intended audience This guide is intended for users who are: Setting up Disaster Recovery as a Service Setting up Journaling Protection Migrating workloads onto the UKCloud platform For Journaling Protection, you must have access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal in the UKCloud zone in which the VMs that you want to protect are located. For Disaster Recovery as a Service or Migration to the Cloud, you must have access to the Zerto Virtual Manager Web Client in the local environment in which the VMs that you want to protect or migrate are located. Creating a virtual protection group in the Zerto Self-Service Portal (Journaling Protection) If you're creating a VPG for Journaling Protection, you specify the vApp to protect and all the VMs in that vApp are included in the VPG. Log in to the ZSSP. For more detailed instructions, see How to access the Zerto Self-Service Portal . Use the ZSSP login link for the zone in which the VMs that you want to protect are located.

    "keywords": "Private Cloud for Compute FAQs Service What is the service? Private Cloud for Compute is a single-tenant UKCloud for VMware service, where your compute requirements are hosted either in one of our data centres, to gain the benefits of our Assured and Elevated cloud platforms; or in your Crown Hosting Data Centre (CHDC); powered by VMware vCloud Director or OpenStack. How does Private Cloud for Compute differ from UKCloud for VMware? Private Cloud for Compute provides you with dedicated infrastructure - the compute infrastructure is designed for the exclusive use of each customer, and provides the highest levels of separation and isolation from other customers. This service differs from UKCloud for VMware in that it also allows you to have more flexibility in the size of your VMs. What backup/disaster recovery options do I get? You can choose between two protection levels: Automated VM backup - providing protection in one data centre Site replication and failover - providing remote protection in a second data centre Where will my data be physically stored? Your data will be stored in our highly resilient, UK-sovereign tier 3 data centres, which are separated by over 100km. How much data can I store? A core benefit of Private Cloud for Compute is that it can scale to meet the most demanding compute requirements. Management How do I access my environment? You can access your VMs using: The remote console through the UKCloud Portal Remote access protocols (such as RDP/SSH) over a VPN or secure network Documentation on ways to interact with the platform is available from the UKCloud Knowledge Centre. Support How do I raise a support ticket? UKCloud's secure online Portal provides the most common service management functionality. Alternatively, you can contact support by phone or email. How do I manage my services? Private Cloud for Compute on the Assured OFFICIAL (formerly IL2) domain can be managed over the internet via the UKCloud Portal. For the Elevated OFFICIAL (formerly IL3) domain, the security requirements are much stricter and require either a PSN-approved connection, UKCloud Secure Remote Access, or CAPS-approved encryption. What are your service maintenance windows? As far as possible, planned maintenance of UKCloud's infrastructure takes place between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Sunday, or between the hours of 08:00 and 12:00 (UK local time) on a Saturday or Sunday. We provide customers with at least 14 days' advance notice of planned maintenance. As far as possible, emergency maintenance of UKCloud's infrastructure takes place between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Sunday, or between the hours of 08:00 and 12:00 (UK local time) on Saturday or Sunday, unless there is an identified and demonstrable immediate risk to a customer's environment. Whenever possible, we provide customers with at least six hours' advance notice of emergency maintenance. Onboarding How can I get started with the service? On acceptance of your order, we'll work with you to create a detailed design for your Private Cloud - Compute service. The design will formalise the dedicated components required for your solution. If this is a new service for you, we will create your primary administrator account and send you a welcome pack, which includes the URL for the UKCloud Portal for access to the Knowledge Centre and service management function. Billing and legal What is the smallest unit of time I will be billed for? Billing depends on the packaging option chosen - the smallest option for this service is monthly. Please note, this service is offered under a 24-month minimum term commitment. How can I pay for the services? Service charges are billed monthly in arrears. In addition, there will be initial upfront charges, which vary depending on the pricing model selected. Payment can be made by direct bank transfer (BACS/CHAPS). How can I view billing information? Billing information is available via the UKCloud Portal. What are the termination fees? An early exit charge will be payable if the contract is terminated before the end of its original term. Customers are responsible for extracting their data from the platform if required. UKCloud may make an additional charge for transferring data out of the service. Is there a free trial? Owing to the dedicated, single-tenant nature of this service, no trials are available. Security What data is suitable for our cloud? The service is hosted in the UK and operated by SC-cleared staff. It has extensive independent validation (including CESG design reviews) that it is fully aligned with NCSC Cloud Security Principles, and is therefore ideal for all data classified at OFFICIAL (including OFFICIAL SENSITIVE). Can systems on different UKCloud platforms communicate with one another?

    "keywords": "Portal user access For all customers in the UKCloud Portal there is a concept of companies, business accounts and services, which allows for different levels of segregation. When a customer starts using UKCloud's Portal, we create the initial administrator username that enables access prior to any customer data or systems being provisioned on our platforms. Security of our services is paramount and we provide the facilities to enable customers to manage user access; this is also because we have no means of verifying the identity, roles and access rights of an individual user. Administrator responsibilities Customers need to allocate administrators who are responsible for: Adding and deleting new user accounts Maintaining the appropriate permissions and access for users Activating and locking individual user accounts where required Resetting passwords and memorable words Ensuring that only appropriate users are listed as administrators To avoid a situation where all administrators are unable to access services, UKCloud recommends that each customer assigns multiple administrators and ensures that memorable words are maintained. UKCloud Support There are a number of Access Management activities which UKCloud can assist with. These are: Enabling access to multiple business accounts for individual users. This can be provided through a Service Request raised by a user from the business account for which access will be enabled. VPN set up on a secondary vShield Edge. Customers are able to configure and manage an edge gateway VPN on their primary edge gateway; however where a secondary edge gateway is used, UKCloud will assist in establishing the VPN and administering VPN accounts and passwords. Customers can also choose to install and self-manage an alternative VPN product. Password reset and account unlock for an administrator. In this scenario the administrator will need to provide details from their memorable word. UKCloud Support will send credentials to the telephone number registered to the administrator's user account. Provide a listing of user account permissions. We recognise that customers may wish to undertake an audit of the permissions of Portal users. Permission for each user are visible under Contacts and we can also provide an extract of these. Password reset In the event that you need to reset your password: For the Assured OFFICIAL Portal, a self-service facility is available from the log on page. Alternatively your administrator can change your password or memorable word. For the Elevated OFFICIAL Portal, your password or memorable word will need to be changed by your administrator. UKCloud Support will advise you of the names of your administrators if required.

    "keywords": "An overview of Portal permissions System admins are presented with several options to control user permissions through the UKCloud Portal. The information below is intended as a brief guide to which permissions are applied using each setting. User is admin? User gets full administrative privileges across the entire account. This includes all of the permissions listed below. Permissions for Settings Update: A user can update all of the account settings. This includes changing the security methods applied to the account, such as updating security restrictions to require memorable word, password timeout and 2FA. These users can also change the details of the accounts primary and secondary contacts. All: Presently this offers the same capability the update permission. Leave these boxes unchecked to deny a user these capabilities. Permissions for Contacts Contact and user permissions dictate whether the user is able to make changes to who has access to the account, and their role inside of it. A contact is just contact details, they may not necessarily have an actual user account. To enable a contact to have User access, the must be marked as \"active\". Create Read Update Delete All Contact Can create a new contact for that account. Can view existing contacts in that account. Can edit existing contacts but cannot create new ones. Can delete existing contacts. All of the above. User Can create a user associated to a contact for that account and assign permissions. Can view existing users for contacts. Can edit existing users and their permissions. Can delete existing users from contacts. All of the above. Permissions for Support Support Permissions dictate whether a user can view and raise support tickets, and whether they can view other users support tickets. Create Read Update All User support tickets Can log their own support tickets in their name. Can view their own support tickets. Can update their own support tickets. All of the above. Account support tickets Can log their own support tickets. Can view all tickets logged by users across that account. Can update anyone’s support ticket across that account. All of the above. Permissions for Compute Services: Compute service permissions are based on the vCloud director RBAC (role based access control permissions). These roles are applied on a service by service basis - for example someone might be a catalogue author of one service, and a console only user in a secondary service. The roles exposed are: Admin Catalogue Author vApp Author vApp User Console Only You can find further details of these roles in Chapter 11 of the vCloud Director Administrator's Guide. In addition, UKCloud have created an API Only role, that restricts users to accessing vCloud Director solely via the API - no GUI access. Permissions for Cloud Storage Users need to be granted access to the relevant namespace. Once access is granted, the user will be able to see the namespace, list the buckets in the namespace and reset the secret key. The user will also be able to see consumption data for namespaces and buckets. Permissions for OpenStack services Users need to be granted access to the relevant OpenStack project. Once access is granted, the user can access the Horizon dashboard for the project. Permissions for Billing Users can see financial data for their compute services in My VM’s. This includes spend to date and estimated spend for the month. © UKCloud Ltd , 2018. All Rights Reserved."

    "href": "articles/openstack/ostack-how-create-load-balancer.html",
    "title": "How to create load balancing services on UKCloud for OpenStack | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Creating load-balancing services on UKCloud for OpenStack Overview Although OpenStack's Neutron project does support load-balancing natively, our testing has shown that this is not a highly available solution which could result in the loss of traffic flow to a project in the event of a host failure, this view has been echoed by many other OpenStack vendors. In order to mitigate against this scenario, we have created the following article, which enables you to easily deploy our load-balancing solution within your OpenStack projects. Benefits of this solution include: Highly Available implementation of an OpenStack load-balancing solution Advanced load-balancing services provided by HAProxy (for example, SSL support, session stickiness) Fully scripted repeatable deployment (HEAT template available on the UKCloud Knowledge Centre alongside this article) Caveats This solution utilises HAProxy and keepalived, both of which are complicated software products. This guide will help you set up UKCloud for OpenStack to enable you to deploy a load-balancing solution based on keepalived and haProxy, but additional tuning and configuration may be required depending on your intended setup. Please take a moment to have a read through the documentation for both the keepalived project - http://www.keepalived.org/documentation.html and the HAProxy project - http://www.haproxy.org . Prerequisites This guide assumes that you have the following already configured in your environment: A router connected to the internet external network. A jump server with required security groups to allow you to SSH to that server and to SSH inside your environment. At least two servers inside your environment running a web server to test the HAProxy configuration against. The Ubuntu 16.04 amd64 image (id: b8617599-495f-4d00-abf9-57b431caeb4c ) has been used throughout this document. Implementation steps Create the network in which your front edge load balancers sit. Command: neutron net-create <network-name> Example: neutron net-create FrontEdge Result: Create the subnet in which your load-balancers will be placed (we recommend creating a /28 , as four addresses will be used internally by OpenStack). Command: neutron subnet-create --name <subnetName> <networkName> <cidr> Example: neutron subnet-create --name FrontEdge FrontEdge 192.168.0.0/28 Result: Attach your internet router to the newly created network. Locate your router. Command: neutron router-list Result: Add the Interface to the router. Command: neutron router-interface-add <RouterName> <NetworkName> Example: neutron router-interface-add R1 FrontEdge Result: Create a port to be used as the VIP addresses. Command: neutron port-create --fixed-ip subnet_id=<subnetName>,ip_address=<vipIP> <NetworkName> Example: neutron port-create --fixed-ip subnet_id=FrontEdge,ip_address=192.168.0.5 FrontEdge Result: Make a note of the ID and the IP you set as you will need this information later. Associate Floating IP with newly created VIP port. Get a new floating IP. Command: neutron floatingip-create <floatingIPPoolName> Example: neutron floatingip-create internet Result: Make a note of the ID you will need it in the next step. Associate the floating IP to VIP port-create. Command: neutron floatingip-associate <floatingIPID> <portID> Example: neutron floatingip-associate 247b7001-f145-4a61-8988-7bdf61915e4f6653ae36-6a30-4eed-8c5a-da567c92610d Result: Create and boot the two load-balancer instances. Get a list of availability zones to ensure resilience of the LB pair. Command: nova availability-zone-list Result: Make a note of available zones, as you'll want to boot one server into one zone and the other into the other. Get available flavours. Command: nova flavor-list Result: Make a note of the ID of the flavour you want to use. Get available images. Command: glance image-list Result: Make a note of the ID of the image you want to boot. Boot the first server. Command: nova boot --flavor <flavorID> --image <imageID> --key-name <keyName> --availability-zone <availabilityZone> --nic net-name=<networkName>,v4-fixed-ip=<fixedIP> <name> Example: nova boot --flavor 43746228-0c64-4e33-b39d-c3f91bedb7cc --image b8617599-495f-4d00-abf9-57b431caeb4c --key-name user-laptop --availability-zone 0000c-1 --nic net-name=FrontEdge,v4-fixed-ip=192.168.0.6 LB1-node1 Result: Boot the second server, remembering to change the availability zone and the IP address of the server. Command: nova boot --flavor <flavorID> --image <imageID> --key-name <key-name> --availability-zone <availability-zone> --nic net-name=<networkName>,v4-fixed-ip=<fixedIP> <name> Example: nova boot --flavor 43746228-0c64-4e33-b39d-c3f91bedb7cc --image b8617599-495f-4d00-abf9-57b431caeb4c --key-name user-laptop --availability-zone 0000c-2 --nic net-name=FrontEdge,v4-fixed-ip=192.168.0.7 LB1-node2 Result: Update ports to allow traffic to be sent via VIP IP. Get the port IDs that need updating. Command: neutron port-list network-id <network-id> Example: neutron port-list --network-id e1909abc-9ce6-45e7-8a3a-9c53d7c4af2b Result: You need to locate the ports that are attached to your load-balancer instances. Once you've located them, note down the IDs as you'll need them in the next steps. Update the first port to allow traffic to pass on VIP IP. Command: neutron update-port <portID> --allowed_address_pairs list=true type=dict ip_address=<VIPIP> Example: neutron port-update cbe044c6-8501-4e9f-9b68-7bedc45cd0ee -allowed_address_pairs list=true type=dict ip_address=192.168.0.5 Result: Update the second port to allow traffic to pass on VIP IP. Command: neutron update-port <portID> --allowed_address_pairs list=true type=dict ip_address=<VIPIP> Example: neutron port-update 4dd06a59-6c18-4996-b80f-7c1577a1595e -allowed_address_pairs list=true type=dict ip_address=192.168.0.5 Result: Patch and install keepalived and HAProxy. SSH to your jump server, and then through to the first load-balancer. Run a system update. sudo apt-get update -y sudo apt-get upgrade -y Install keepalived and HAProxy. sudo apt-get install haproxy keepalived -y Configure keepalived. Copy example configuration to keepalive config directory. sudo cp /usr/share/doc/keepalived/samples/keepalived.conf.vrrp /etc/keepalived/keepalivd.conf Delete lines 36 through 79 in /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf . Set the email address you want to receive notifications in the Notification_email section. Set the notification_email_from email addresses. Set the SMTP server IP. Set the interface name to be the name of the first network interface on the server (not loopback). Set the Router_ID to a description of the router's function. Set the auth_pass to a new secure password (avoid special characters). Remove all items inside the virtual_ipaddress section. Add the VIP IP from earlier to the virtual_ipaddress section (This is the internal IP NOT the floating IP). Save and exit the file. Take a copy of the file, and transfer it to the second load balancer machine. Enable non-local IP binding on the first load balancer. Add net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1 to /etc/sysctl.conf Add net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind = 1 to /etc/sysctl.conf sudo sysctl -p Configure the second load balancer. Place a copy of the first load balancer's keepalived.conf into /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf . Edit /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf and make the following changes Change state to BACKUP Change priority to 90 Save and exit the file Enable non-local IP binding on the second server. Add net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1 to /etc/sysctl.conf sudo sysctl -p Start keepalived on first load balancer. sudo service keepalived start Start keepalived on the second load balancer. sudo service keepalived start Check to ensure that the VIP IP has come up on the first load balancer. ip add -4 -o a You should see the VIP showing up in the resulting list. Fail the first load balancer and ensure that the VIP moves to the second load balancer. Configure HAProxy on the first load balancer by adding a frontend and backend Edit /etc/haproxy/haproxy.conf Add the following section to the bottom of the file: frontend localnodes bind <VIPIP>:80 mode http default_backend nodes Add the following section below the frontend section: backend nodes mode http balance roundrobin option forwardfor server <Name> <ServerIP>:<serverPort> check server <Name> <ServerIP>:<serverPort> check Copy the changes from the first load balancer to the second load balancer. On both load balancers issue a reload command to hot restart HAProxy and load in the new changes. sudo service haproxy reload Set up security groups required for your application, and apply them to the load-balancer servers. You will also need to apply security groups to your backend servers to allow the required traffic to pass from the load-balancer nodes to the required ports on the back-end servers. Testing - Once HAProxy has reloaded on both servers, you should be able to connect to your floating IP address and the content hosted on your web servers should now be visible. Try disabling keepalived on the first load-balancer after a few seconds traffic should flow through to the second load-balancer and your content should still be available. Post installation Depending on the amount of traffic you expect to see, you may need to make additional tuning changes to your load balancer systems. Usually these changes take the form of increasing the number of available ephemeral ports, and the enablement of tcp_tw_reuse . Please do careful research on these settings before making changes. We recommend making these changes on a non-live system and testing before applying these changes to a production system. You may also wish to investigate keepalived ability to monitor applications on the local system and force a fail over if an application crashes. For example, keepalived can be made to monitor HAProxy and to fail over if HAProxy stops or fails. Instructions on how to do this can be found in the keepalived documentation. First free load balancer To meet the UKCloud for OpenStack G-Cloud Service Definition commitment of one free load balancer per per project, we will credit the first two instances in a project which match the following criteria: Region Flavor ID Image ID Instance name prefix COR00005 43746228-0c64-4e33-b39d-c3f91bedb7cc b8617599-495f-4d00-abf9-57b431caeb4c LB1- Note UKCloud has the right to remove this free solution with 30 days notice once the default OpenStack LBaaS service has been made available.

This service enables you to use UKCloud's main infrastructure platforms to meet the specialist requirements of some advanced applications, with the benefits of a cloud environment. It supports the following types of workloads: Compute workloads. GPUs have become prevalent in a world that needs a lot of data processing, fast. The parallel nature of GPU cores lends itself perfectly to supporting initiatives such as deep or machine learning and large-scale mathematical modelling. Visualisation workloads. Describes the traditional use cases for GPU processing --- these include simulation, powering desktop applications with graphics content (such as computer aided design), video encoding, rendering or streaming. This Getting Started Guide provides an introduction for how to use Cloud GPU for visualisation workloads and describes the tasks you need to perform to get the service up and running. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have access to the UKCloud Portal and vCloud Director. Cloud GPU overview We offer two GPU variants for use with our cloud platform: Use case Compute Visualisation Likely card NVIDIA® Tesla® P100 NVIDIA M60 Series Card with GRID™ Overview NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU accelerators are the most advanced ever built. Designed to accelerate the compute-intensive elements of applications, they are ideal if you're looking to deliver deep learning, analytics or HPC solutions. NVIDIA GRID is designed to share virtual GPUs (vGPUs) across multiple virtual desktop and applications instances. This enables you to deliver graphically intensive applications such as design software and video streaming.

By doing so, users can access the tools they need from anywhere, anytime on commodity devices. Visualise data in real-time --- Improved visualisation capabilities provided by Cloud GPU Visualisation enables you to visualise data in real-time to render virtualised environments when you need them. This helps you to: Design using Computer Aided Design applications in a centralised environment, enabling ease of collaboration Create and run simulations Render and analyse high resolution images and video Before you begin When using our Cloud GPU service for visualisation workloads, you should consider the following: Before requesting your Cloud GPU Visualisation service: You must create a virtual machine (VM) for the service. You can use any template for the VM, but bear in mind that the operating system must be compatible with the vGPU profile that you select for the service (see table in Provisioning your Cloud GPU service ). Your Cloud GPU VM must be in a PRIORITY virtual data centre (VDC). Your Cloud GPU VM should be using hardware version 11 (to upgrade the hardware version, right-click the VM and select Upgrade Virtual Hardware Version ). You must power off the vApp that contains your Cloud GPU VM so that UKCloud can migrate the VM to a GPU-enabled server. Snapshot Protection is not available for your VM, so you must implement your own backup solution. Currently, there is no high availability or disaster recovery option; your VM cannot be migrated to a different host in the event of host failure. In the event of a host failure, you must wait for the host to be returned to service. Provisioning your Cloud GPU service When your VM is ready, make sure it is powered off and then use My Calls in the UKCloud Portal to raise a service request for the Cloud GPU service. Provide the following details in the ticket so that UKCloud can complete the setup of your service: Service type: GPU -- Visualisation VDC name vApp name VM name vGPU profile that you want to use (see table below) vGPU profile Intended use case Frame buffer (Mbytes) Virtual display heads Maximum resolution per display head Effective number of vGPUs M60-8Q* Designer 8192 4 4096x2160 8 M60-4Q* Designer 4096 4 4096x2160 4 M60-2Q* Designer 2048 4 4096x2160 2 M60-1Q* Power User, Designer 1024 2 4096x2160 1 M60-8A Virtual Application User 8192 1 1280x1024 8 M60-4A Virtual Application User 4096 1 1280x1024 4 M60-2A Virtual Application User 2048 1 1280x1024 2 M60-1A Virtual Application User 1024 1 1280x1024 1 * M60-Q profiles are for 64-bit Linux UKCloud will confirm that you've set up your VM correctly and that it meets all the necessary prerequisites. If the VM meets all requirements, UKCloud will migrate the VM to a GPU‑enabled host and attach the GPU card to your VM. Installing NVIDIA drivers When UKCloud has provisioned your Cloud GPU server, you can install the appropriate NVIDIA drivers. To install NVIDIA drivers: Power on your VM. Right-click your VM and select Insert CD/DVD from Catalog . In the Insert CD dialog box, in the search field, enter vGPU and click the Refresh icon. Select the vGPU driver ISO and click Insert .

    "keywords": "How to monitor your OpenShift cluster Overview UKCloud for OpenShift enables you to develop, deploy, and manage digital and container-based applications seamlessly across local physical or virtual environments, with full portability to and from UKCloud. This guide explains how you can set up a simple system to monitor an OpenShift cluster. Intended audience This guide assumes familiarity with the Linux command line, and with the oc command set to manage an OpenShift cluster. Prerequisites To complete the steps in this guide, you must have the oc command installed and have a suitable account on your OpenShift cluster. Specifically, it is assumed you know the authentication credentials that need to be supplied to oc login. Generating an authentication token The first step is to create a service account within your OpenShift cluster that your monitoring system can use, and create an authentication token for it. Tip The token may have already been created, so it's worth checking first. Log in to OpenShift on the command line: oc login ... oc project openshift-infra Check if a monitoring account already exists: oc get serviceaccount --all-namespaces | grep infra | \\ grep monitoring If the account exists, the command above prints the name, and you can move on to Reading the authentication token . If it prints nothing, you need to create the account as described in the remaining steps below. Create the monitoring account if it does not exist: oc create serviceaccount monitoring Add the role cluster-reader to the account: oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-reader \\ system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:monitoring Reading the authentication token Next, you need to retrieve the authentication token that you created in the previous step. If you haven't already done so, ensure you are logged in to OpenShift and connected to the right project: oc login ... oc project openshift-infra Find the name of the monitoring account's token IDs: oc describe serviceaccount monitoring This lists the IDs of one or more token names, for example, monitoring-token-1abc2 . Find the actual authentication token by querying the secret by the name given in the previous step, for example: oc describe secret <monitoring-token> Where monitoring-token is the token name you found in the previous step. This lists a few values, including the 179-character authentication token. Using the authentication token The OpenShift API provides a way of determining the health of the cluster; the data required to do this is obtainable by requesting the API at /api/vi/nodes . You must supply the authentication token in the HTTP Authorization header. The following example shows how to query this data from a shell command using curl. $ token=\"<authentication_token>\" $ endpoint= https://ocp.<my-cluster-url>.ukcloud.com:8443 $ curl -k -H \"Authorization: Bearer ${token}\" \\ -H 'Accept: application/json' ${endpoint}/api/v1/nodes You'll need to customise the query above by providing the correct values for endpoint and token. This API call returns a reasonable amount of JSON-encoded data, which may be hard to parse using shell commands. It's also necessary to fetch items from various places within this data. The Python program in the following section shows you how to accomplish this. Using the OpenShift API to obtain cluster status The code example below uses the OpenShift API to obtain information about the health of the cluster, and prints a summary showing if each node is healthy. #!/usr/bin/env python3 import urllib.request import json import ssl def get_all_nodes(endpoint, token): \"\"\"Fetch the nodes data from the openshift cluster\"\"\" request = urllib.request.Request(endpoint + \"/api/v1/nodes\") request.add_header('Authorization', 'Bearer ' + token) request.add_header('Accept', 'application/json') ssl_context = None # or ssl._create_unverified_context() result = urllib.request.urlopen(request, context=ssl_context) return result.read() def get_status_from_node(data_item): \"\"\" Extract the status conditions from the data\"\"\" addresses = data_item['status']['addresses'] address = None for addr in addresses: if addr['type'] == 'Hostname': address = addr['address'] return {'hostname': address, 'conditions': data_item['status']['conditions']} def find_faults(cond_data): \"\"\" find whether each node is in a failed state\"\"\" cells = [] for node in cond_data: hostname = node['hostname'] state = 'OK ' for cond in node['conditions']: if cond['status'] != \"False\" and cond['type'] != \"Ready\": state = 'FAIL' elif cond['status'] != \"True\" and cond['type'] == \"Ready\": state = 'FAIL' cells.append('{} {} '.format(state, hostname)) return cells def main(): all_nodes = json.loads(get_all_nodes(ENDPOINT, TOKEN)) all_conditions = [] for node in all_nodes['items']: all_conditions.append(get_status_from_node(node)) print(\"Status of Cluster at {}\".format(ENDPOINT)) for node in find_faults(all_conditions): print(node) ENDPOINT = 'https://ocp.my-cluster-url.ukcloud.com:8443' TOKEN = 'eyJhb...the.179.char.token' main() [!TIP] If you encounter problems copying and pasting the source code above, we also provide the code in the following blog post: https://ukcloud.com/news-resources/news/blog/simple-openshift-monitoring Next steps For more information about UKCloud for OpenShift service, see: Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for OpenShift UKCloud for OpenShift FAQs Feedback If you have any comments on this document or any other aspect of your UKCloud experience, send them to products@ukcloud.com ."

    "keywords": "UKCloud for OpenShift FAQs What is UKCloud for OpenShift? UKCloud for OpenShift is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution providing container management and orchestration using either Red Hat OpenShift or Cloud Foundry technology to deliver a flexible, scalable cloud application platform. Unlike traditional managed PaaS offerings, it provides a modern application platform that accelerates end-to-end development, deployment and operation of digital applications, while raising overall application reliability and availability. Why deliver UKCloud for OpenShift as a cloud service? Although UKCloud for OpenShift is a simple, benefits-rich service to consume, it is a complex platform of inter-dependent servers and services, whose deployment, configuration and maintenance requires time and expertise. By offering this service, we take on all that complexity so that customers can immediately realise the value of UKCloud for OpenShift by simply consuming it. Is UKCloud for OpenShift a single-tenant or multi-tenant solution? UKCloud for OpenShift is built as a single-tenant platform on-top of UKCloud's secure, assured multi-tenant UKCloud for OpenStack IaaS platform, helping to deliver the benefits of single tenant isolation with the economics and flexibility of multi-tenant infrastructure. How is UKCloud for OpenShift billed? Red Hat OpenShift . This service comprises of two charges elements: Starter Pack - providing an initial footprint of 32GiB of RAM, billed by the month with a one-month minimum commitment Expansion Pack - billed by the month with a one-month minimum commitment based upon the amour of additional RAM consumed Open source Cloud Foundry . This service comprises of two charging elements: Starter Pack -- providing an initial footprint of 32GiB of RAM, billed by the month with a one-month minimum commitment Expansion Pack - billed by the hour based upon the amour of additional RAM consumed Does UKCloud offer a free trial? Free trials are currently available for UKCloud for OpenShift. Please get in touch with your Account Manager to raise this request. Is there a free tier to your service? Due to the complexities of providing a dedicated, single-tenant environment, a free tier is currently not offered on UKCloud for OpenShift. Where is the service hosted? The service is delivered by UKCloud, a UK company, from two UK data centres separated by more than 100km, which are securely connected by high-bandwidth, low-latency dedicated connectivity. Does my data leave the UK? As the service is delivered from UK data centres by a UK company, your data doesn't leave the UK when at rest. How is UKCloud for OpenShift supported? UKCloud manages and supports UKCloud for OpenShift using our dedicated support team based in the UK. Support is available via helpdesk ticket or phone. What constitutes UKCloud for OpenShift? We monitor, maintain and support our controlled UKCloud for OpenShift infrastructure and services, including: UKCloud-controlled components, such as the virtual infrastructure, storage, power and physical firewalls and routers UKCloud-maintained OpenShift services (for example, router service, DEAs, health manager, cloud controller, Master Nodes, Worker Nodes, Routing Layer). Can I use UKCloud for OpenShift in the UKCloud Elevated (previously IL3) domain? UKCloud for OpenShift services are available in both our Assured (previously IL2) and Elevated (previously IL3) security domains. Is the service Pan Government Accredited? UKCloud's existing PGA continues to apply to the infrastructure underpinning our services. But since the move to the Government Security Classification Policy (GSCP), we can no longer seek PGA for newer services, such as UKCloud for OpenShift. We are now required to self-assert our services, with customers taking responsibility for assessing and selecting the most appropriate cloud services to meet their individual security requirements. We provide confidence that our OpenShift service still meets the highest level of information assurance, which is why we continue to have our platform independently tested and validated, and have the findings made available to customers and partners. This enables SIROs to make an informed decision about any service they choose to consume. Can I use UKCloud for OpenShift over closed networks such as PSN and N3? We plan for this service to be accredited for use over PSN, however this may not be available at launch. Connectivity to the N3 network will be considered when an appropriate sponsor submits a requirement. Does UKCloud offer any scheduled automated backups for UKCloud for OpenShift? As standard, localised component failures are tolerated within the infrastructure through elimination of single points of failure (including physical server failure or disk failure). Although UKCloud for OpenShift is designed to deploy and manage stateless apps (applications that can be killed and re-instantiated without risk of data loss), customers should ensure they maintain a master copy or backup copy of any persistent or dynamic data hosted on this service (such as MySQL DB) by using, for example, our Cloud Storage. What languages and frameworks are compatible with UKCloud for OpenShift? The service supports many popular development frameworks and languages such as: Java Spring Ruby Sinatra Node.js Python PHP GoLang Does UKCloud for OpenShift support any data services? Our OpenShift service provides popular open source data service packages deployable within the platform, all supported by the global open source community, including: MySQL, an open source relational database Postgres, a relational database based on PostgreSQL MongoDB, a scalable, open, document-based database RabbitMQ, for reliable, scalable and portable messaging for applications Note that these services are offered 'as is' with no management, support or availability commitment from UKCloud. We strongly suggest customers ensure they maintain a master copy or backup copy of any persistent or dynamic data hosted on this service (such as MySQL DB) by using, for example, a data service provided by a managed service provider on our UKCloud for VMware platform. How scalable is UKCloud for OpenShift? As a true cloud platform, UKCloud for OpenShift provides full elasticity and scalability. However, in order to protect the integrity of the platform and manage customer spend, soft limits on the number and size of application instances will be in place. These limits may be extended upon request. Which ports are open to the platform from the internet by default? By default, ports 80 and 443 are open for customer application traffic. Further ports can be opened on request either at time of deployment or post-deployment by raising a Service Request How do I add users? In order to add new users, you will need to raise a Service Request on the UKCloud Portal. What monitoring of the services is provided by default in a trial? By default, a minimal Zabbix infrastructure gets deployed to enable customer monitoring of the nodes and other services. However, we recommend external monitoring services such as Datadog or Coscale for production-grade OpenShift hosted applications. What monitoring of the services is provided on a billable service? By default, no specific monitoring service is integrated. It is our expectation that customers may want to use a third party or their own monitoring service to ensure cluster availability. There is a metrics service deployed into the cluster that provides utilisation stats of the cluster, and a wide range of metrics about both the cluster itself and the containers running within it can be extracted via the API to this service. Can I integrate external monitoring SaaS providers or my own monitoring agents to the service? We will happily work with customers during a trial period to integrate an external monitoring service that enables customer monitoring of the cluster and applications where infrastructure level configuration is required. How do I add extra capacity to my cluster? To add extra capacity to you cluster, you will need to raise a Service Request on the UKCloud Portal. We hope to provide portal integration to enable customers to be in control of this in the future. Can I have integrated container logging deployed with the platform? Yes, this can be requested at time of deployment, or added post-deployment. The services can be run on either the master nodes or the worker nodes in the cluster. By default, we would place them on the master nodes, but you may wish to change this placement to be more suitable for the specific cluster performance you desire. How much control do I have over the policies and configuration of the platform once it has been deployed? Customers have full administrative rights over the cluster configuration via the UI and API. Due to the varied nature of configurations that customers may want, such as the ability to merge projects and add service accounts for applications, we provide customers with the ability to self-serve on cluster administration from the beginning. Only infrastructure level tasks are controlled by UKCloud, such as adding users, scaling environments and patching. Can I run a privileged container? Yes, it is possible to run a privileged container. However, this is not recommended as it goes against security best practices. What is the underlying architecture of the starter deployment?

    "keywords": "Understanding High Performance Compute Overview The scale and elasticity of cloud makes it an ideal environment for large-scale compute-intensive workloads such as Grid Engines, High Performance/Throughput Compute (HPC/HTC) and Massively Parallel Processing (MPP), all of which have an enduring requirement for large amounts of processor cores and memory. UKCloud's High Performance Compute service is designed for these types of workloads. In return for a volume and term commitment for a large number of compute cores, customers get a cost-effective, highly scalable infrastructure. High Performance Compute leverages the benefits of the UKCloud assured cloud platform, providing you with a trusted cloud platform that's connected to key government networks, such as N3/HSCN for health and social care, and Janet for research and education. For workloads that require a temporary, more flexible or dynamic service, UKCloud's UKCloud for VMware may be more suitable. It offers exceptional performance and scalability, and consumption-based pricing. We also offer UKCloud for OpenStack, so we can deliver a suite of services to meet all of your needs. Key benefits High Performance Compute: Uses a proven hyperscale architecture to deliver predictable performance at scale Optimised for the sensitivity of your specific workload via the DDoS-protected internet-facing Assured domain and the trusted Elevated domain Offers a choice of virtual machine (VM) sizes to suit the core and memory density requirements of your compute-intensive workload Is tuned to reflect the inherent resilience provided by your Grid Engine solution Meaning that you can: Deploy compute-intensive workloads on a massively scalable and inexpensive platform Avoid the CAPEX costs, risk and complexity associated with deploying a private infrastructure Build hybrid cloud solutions optimised for both compute-intensive workloads or more traditional workloads Integrate compute-intensive workloads with systems and datasets located on secure government networks (such as N3/HSCN, Janet and PSN) High Performance Compute features We understand that long-term compute-intensive workloads require a platform that is suitably scaled, has no resource contention, offers flexible core-to-memory ratios, and is delivered at an appropriate per-core-hour price point. UKCloud's High Performance Compute is designed to meet these requirements, and to provide an easy-to-deploy and easy-to-use infrastructure that can power your Grid Engine or parallel processing workloads. The service is provided with a variety of cluster-wide options as follows: Choice of our security domain. We provide both an internet-connected Assured OFFICIAL domain and Elevated OFFICIAL domain, which is primarily connected to government secure networks. Choice of network connections. This includes PSN Assured, PSN Protected (including legacy networks such as GSI, PNN, CJX), RLI, N3/HSCN and Janet. Virtual CPU mode option. High Performance Compute is based on hyper-threaded cores which provide a cost-effective solution for compute-intensive workloads. You can opt for Native mode by using up to half the allocated cores to ensure a one-to-one mapping between virtual CPUs and physical (non hyper-threaded) cores for maximum processing power. Choice of core-to-memory ratio. All VMs in your compute-intensive cluster must be identically configured based on one of two core-to-memory ratios. High Performance Compute includes as standard: Virtual firewall One production virtual data centre (VDC) and one non-production VDC VMware High Availability (HA) protection (only with persistent storage) Basic load balancing DDoS-protected internet Personalised support via Customer Success Managers, Technical Account Managers and a telephone support desk To model a total cost of ownership, you may also want to consider additional elements, such as connectivity; and service options, such as cloud enablement and cross-domain services. High Performance Compute is subject to the following: The minimum cluster size is 1,920 cores; which can be scaled in blocks of 960 cores. All VMs within the cluster must exist within a single production VDC and within a single site. All VMs within the cluster must be identically configured and programmatically deployed with appropriate workload distribution such as a grid engine. This is because the SLA does not apply to availability of individual VMs. If using Tier 0 storage is configured with two local disks in a RAID 10 configuration. All available storage in the cluster will be allocated to the customer with a 6-month minimum commitment. If any VMs are deployed with MS Windows Server OS, all provisioned cores must be licensed and will be charged at the current rate (as shown in the Pricing Guide). There is a two-year (24-month) fixed-term commitment, which can be continued via a further 24-month call-off contract subject to the standard procedures. Committed Compute Spend is calculated as the effective hourly cost multiplied by the number of hours in a two-year period (for example 24 x 365 x 2 = 17,520). 50% of the Committed Compute Spend must be paid upfront; the remaining 50% will be invoiced equally over 24 months. Early Termination Fee: if the contract is terminated before month 24, the customer will be liable for the remaining cost of the Committed Compute Spend In addition to the Committed Compute Spend, a final balancing payment equivalent to 20% of the Committed Compute Spend will be due at month 24 of the contract. The final balancing payment will not apply in the event that the customer enters into a further two-year (24-month) fixed-term commitment.

    "keywords": "Cloud GPU FAQs General What is Cloud GPU? It is a supplementary Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) option that enables customers to meet the specialist compute requirements of certain advanced applications. This falls into two categories: Visualisation workloads - taking advantage of the traditional use of GPU for powerful desktop/server applications which use graphically intensive content, such as computer-aided design (CAD), simulations and video encoding, rendering or streaming. Computational workloads - The parallel nature of general purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) cores enables initiatives such as deep learning, analytics and large-scale mathematical modelling. What technology does Cloud GPU use? The service is provisioned using NVIDIA cards in the required hosts. Different cards are utilised depending on the use case: Visualisation - NVIDIA M60 cards with GRID are designed to share virtual GPUs across multiple virtual desktop and application instances Computational (GPGPU) - NVIDIA Tesla P100 cards are designed to accelerate the compute-intensive elements of applications. How does Cloud GPU work? Cloud GPU utilises NVIDIA's GRID engine to expose GPU resources to client virtual machines (VMs). The GPU card is exposed as a shared PCI device which can then be used by the customer's VM. Are there any prerequisites? Yes. To take advantage of the Cloud GPU service, you must also have UKCloud for VMware VMs running on the UKCloud platform. These VMs must be running in a 'Priority' virtual data centre as the GPU mapping requires 100% memory allocation to the VM. Further to this, VMs wishing to utilise GPGPUs (NVIDIA Tesla P100) must be built from specific GPGPU enabled templates providing specific BIOS settings. Does UKCloud require specific NVIDIA driver versions? Yes. VMs utilising the NVIDIA GRID solution must use the GRID driver matching the driver installed on the vSphere hosts (currently 385.41). This driver can be downloaded from the UKCloud Knowledge Centre . Which Compute platforms support Cloud GPU? Currently, Cloud GPU only supports environments provisioned on UKCloud for VMware in regions 5 and 6. There are future plans to enable the service on UKCloud for OpenStack and High Performance Compute. How is it billed? Cloud GPU is billed per card per hour for GPGPU, and per vGPU per hour for visualisation. Please note that this is in addition to the UKCloud for VMware VM charge. You have the option to power off Cloud GPU when not required to avoid unnecessary costs. All usage is billed and invoiced at the end of each month. Where can I find more information on NVIDIA GRID? The full NVIDIA GRID documentation is available on the NVIDIA website here . Where can I find more information on NVIDIA CUDA? You can find the latest information regarding CUDA on the NVIDIA website here . What is the SLA? The SLA for Cloud GPU is 99.90%. Full details regarding the SLA can be found on page 6 of the Cloud GPU Service Definition ( Assured | Elevated ). What happens if the card fails? If a card failure occurs, our support team will identify the issue and re-instantiate your service on another GPU-enabled host. Can I have multiple GPUs associated with a single VM? Yes. Can the GPU service be added to one of our existing servers or would it require a new server? If you are using the GPU for Visualisation then yes, it could be added to an existing server, if the VM is in a GPU-enabled region. If your existing VM is not in the correct region then we would need to move it to a new server before enabling GPU for Visualisation on it. If you are planning on using GPU for Compute then you would need a new VM as a different BIOS is required.

    "title": "Getting Started Guide for Email and Collaboration as a Service | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for Email and Collaboration as a Service Overview UKCloud offers an Email and Collaboration service, powered by Zimbra, to enable you to have a cloud hosted, secure email service, connected to government networks or the internet. You can connect this mail service through you normal mail applications (for example, Microsoft Outlook), to send and receive mail as well as use lightweight collaborative features. This Getting Started Guide walks you through the process of configuring your Email and Collaboration service. Intended audience This guide is intended for users who want to set up their Email and Collaboration as a Service. To complete the steps in this guide you must have login credentials for an administrator account and access to the Zimbra administration console. Introduction to Email and Collaboration as a Service The Zimbra Collaboration Suite that underpins UKCloud's email offering provides a wide range of client connectivity options. An advanced webmail client allows the full feature set within the suite to be accessed from anywhere that internet connectivity is available and from virtually any platform via a wide-range of supported browsers A cross-platform desktop application is provided extending the functionality of the web client by enabling email to be read and composed while offline IMAP and POP3 clients are supported Calendar and contacts can be accessed via the CalDav and CardDav protocols Full Microsoft Outlook integration is supported using the Zimbra Collaboration Suite Connector for Outlook, which utilizes a full MAPI provider that leverages the Microsoft-standard MAPI interface for contacts, calendar, and other functionality not supported by IMAP or POP The service provides enterprise-class functionality for end-users, on a per-mailbox, per- month pricing model. It offers several options for mailbox access, including POP3, IMAP4 and SMTP --- all with TLS (SSL) encryption --- as well as HTTPS. Exchange ActiveSync is also supported. Although the service was designed with end-users in mind, there's nothing to stop you using the supported protocols to allow an application to access a mailbox in order to send or receive email. This will generally be achieved via SMTP or POP3 over TLS. It's worth noting that there's a minimum commitment of 25 mailboxes with this service --- but they don't all have to be used. Before you begin To start using the Email and Collaboration service, you first need to decide on a domain name, which must be a real-world, registered domain name. You can use a new domain name, or simply delegate a sub-domain of your organisation's existing domain name. You'll need to configure your chosen domain's MX record as mail.skyscapecs.net . Once you've decided on a domain name and submitted your service request, UKCloud will configure your domain name on our platform and create an administrator account. You'll receive a welcome email with details of your administrator account with delegated rights for your email domain. This account will usually be in the following format: admin@<yourdomain> For example: admin@example.com You'll receive the account details as part of the onboarding process; we recommend that you change the account's password immediately. This is the account you'll use to create mailboxes on the platform. You'll need to create a mailbox for each email address you want to be able to send or receive from. Supported browsers Refer to the Zimbra Collaboration Supported Systems document for the most up to date list, at: https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/8.7.0/Supported_Systems Firefox and Chrome on Windows, Mac, Linux Internet Explorer on Windows Safari on Mac and Windows Accessing the Zimbra administration console The Zimbra administration console is a browser-based user interface for managing your mailbox server and mailbox accounts. The way you access the administration console depends on which security domain you use: The Assured OFFICIAL console is accessible from the internet or via the PSN Assured network (depending on the service selected) The Elevated OFFICIAL console is accessible only via the PSN Protected network (and other interconnecting networks) We'll provide you with the URL for the administration console along with your account details. Creating a user account Creating a user account sets up the appropriate entries in the LDAP directory server. When the user logs in for the first time, or when the first email is delivered to the user's account, the mailbox is created on the mailbox server. To create a user account: In the administration console, select Manage and then Accounts . Click the gear symbol in the top-right of the main panel and select New . Enter an Account name and the user's Last name . (The other fields are optional.) If the new account will be an administrator, select the Administrator checkbox in the Account Setup section. Scroll down to set the initial Password then click Next . Enter the new user's contact information then click Next . Enter any aliases required for the account then click Next . Add the account to any required distribution lists then click Next . If the account is an administrator account, you need to add it to the administration group at this point, to grant the necessary rights within the domain. To do this: In the Find field under Add distribution lists to the account , enter admingroup and click Search . Select the resulting admingroup@yourdomain . Click Add at the bottom of the dialog box to make the new account a member of the group. Specify any forwarding rules. Click Finish to complete creation of the account. The user can log in to and use the account immediately. It will take up to an hour to add the account to the Global Address List, during which time the account name won't be listed as an auto-complete option for users composing emails. Getting to know the Zimbra web client Zimbra offers standard HTML, advanced JavaScript, and mobile web clients that you can log into. The web clients include mail, calendar, address book, and task functionality. You can select the client to use when you log in. The advanced web client includes Ajax capability and offers a full set of web collaboration features. This web client works best with newer browsers and fast internet connections. The standard web client is a good option when internet connections are slow or if you prefer HTML-based messaging for navigating within your mailbox. The mobile web client provides an experience optimized for smaller screen formats available on mobile devices. Typically when you log in, you'll see the advanced Zimbra web client. You can switch to a different version if you prefer by using the Version list on the login screen. If the Zimbra web client detects that the screen resolution is 800x600, you're automatically redirected to the standard web client. You can still select the advanced web client but will see a warning message suggesting the use of the standard client for a better screen view. When connecting to Zimbra using a mobile web browser, Zimbra will automatically detect and default to the mobile web client. To access the Zimbra web client: Go to the following location: https://mail.skyscapecs.net/ Log in using your account's email address and password.

This can be referred to as an electronic mailshot. IMAP The Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is a mail protocol used for accessing email on a remote web server from a local client. LDAP Lightweight Directory Access Protocol is an Internet protocol that email and other programs use to look up information from a server. LDAP is mostly used by medium-to-large organisations. POP POP stands for Post Office Protocol. POP3 is version 3 of the protocol. When an e-mail is sent to your address, it is stored on the mail server until it is downloaded via your e-mail client (Outlook, your mobile, etc.) using POP3. After the e-mail has been downloaded to your client, it is removed from the server altogether. SMTP Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. SMTP is used when email is delivered from an email client, such as Outlook Express, to an email server or when email is delivered from one email server to another. SMTP uses port 25. TLS Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), both frequently referred to as \"SSL\", are cryptographic protocols that provide communications security over a computer network. Zimbra An enterprise-class email, calendar and collaboration solution built for the cloud, both public and private.

    "title": "Cloud Storage FAQs | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Cloud Storage FAQs Service What is the service? Cloud Storage from UKCloud is a secure next-generation storage platform designed to address a wide variety of use cases. It's based on Dell EMC Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS), which is an object storage technology natively optimised for cloud storage in terms of scale, resilience and accessibility. Where will my data be physically stored? Data will be stored in one or both of our highly resilient tier 3, UK-sovereign data centres, which are separated by over 100km. How much data can I store? Our Cloud Storage solution can scale to multi-Petabytes across multiple sites, meeting the most demanding storage requirements. How many copies of my data are included? Object storage technology works in a slightly different way to traditional local storage solutions that tend to use RAID as a method to provide data durability. Instead, Cloud Storage provides data resilience using the Reed Solomon 12 + 4 erasure coding scheme, which splits an object into 12 data fragments and 4 coding fragments. These fragments are spread across multiple nodes in the data centre and the storage engine can reconstruct an object from any of the 12 data fragments, providing protection in the event of a disk or node failure. The ENHANCED service level stores an additional copy of your data in our second, geographically remote data centre. Management How do I access the platform? The service is Application Programming Interface (API) accessible, so is an ideal target for customer applications. It can also be used by existing systems. In addition, the platform can be accessed using a variety of software tools such as cloud storage gateways, file browsers and other software products. Documentation on ways to interact with the platform is available from the Knowledge Centre . Is data accessible via the PSN Assured connection also accessible via the internet? Cloud Storage in our Assured OFFICAL domain uses the same environment for both PSN Assured and internet connections. Although it is not possible to bridge between these connections, any objects placed in Cloud Storage via PSN Assured will also be accessible via the internet using the appropriate customer credentials. Which APIs are supported by the platform? Our Cloud Storage supports an Elastic Cloud Storage S3-compatible API and the native ATMOS RESTful API. Documentation and user manuals for supported API calls are available from the Knowledge Centre. How frequently can I back up data? The frequency of data backup is defined and managed by your organisation administrator. UKCloud's object storage is however highly durable and can automatically recover from disk and node failure, negating the need for a backup. What reports can I get about storage usage? We provide tools for monitoring used capacity and storage growth via the UKCloud Portal. What software tools are provided? UKCloud does not provide software tools for accessing the platform as storage is accessed via APIs, supporting S3 and Native ATMOS. You can however directly connect any S3 compatible tools to your storage (for example, S3 Browser and Cyberduck). How do I encrypt my data-at-rest? Data at rest encryption is an optional feature of our Cloud Storage product, with no additional cost. There are three options available to Cloud Storage customers looking to encrypt their data: Customer managed encryption. The Customer encrypts their data prior to moving it into UKCloud Cloud Storage. This avoids having to do any additional development against the ECS S3 API and ensures the customer retains the keys used to encrypt the data. Server-side encryption at rest with system generated keys. The customer enables server-side encryption in the request headers when creating buckets using the S3-compatible API, without specifying the keys. In this case the keys are auto-generated by ECS, simplifying key management. However, customers should be aware that the public and private keys used at the top of the hierarchy are shared between all customers encrypting their data through this method. See page 37 of the ECS Architecture whitepaper for more information on this encryption method. Server-side encryption at rest with user-supplied keys. The customer enables server-side encryption in the request header with user-supplied keys when creating buckets using the S3-compatible API. This increases complexity but ensures the customer retains control of their keys when using server-side encryption. There is an example of this method on page 14 of the ECS Security Configuration guide . Ultimately, it is down to the customer to select which encryption methodology should be used and understand the possible risks involved. How do I create new Cloud Storage users? To create additional users, you must raise a service request through the UKCloud Portal. When requesting additional users, you can specify whether they should have read-write or read-only access to your buckets. Support How do I raise a support ticket? UKCloud's secure online Portal provides the most common service management functionality, enabling you to raise support tickets through My Calls . Alternatively, you can contact support by phone or email. How do I manage my services? Cloud Storage on the Assured OFFICIAL domain can be managed over the internet (or other connectivity) via the UKCloud Portal. For the Elevated OFFICIAL domain, security requirements are stricter and require either a PSN-approved connection, UKCloud Secure Remote Access or CAPS-approved encryption. What are your service maintenance windows? As far as possible, planned maintenance of UKCloud's infrastructure takes place between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Sunday, or between the hours of 08:00 and 12:00 (UK local time) on a Saturday or Sunday. We provide customers with at least 14 days' advance notice of planned maintenance. As far as possible, emergency maintenance of UKCloud's infrastructure takes place between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Sunday, or between the hours of 08:00 and 12:00 (UK local time) on Saturday or Sunday, unless there is an identified and demonstrable immediate risk to a customer's environment. Whenever possible, we provide customers with at least six hours advance notice of emergency maintenance. Does the Cloud Storage solution support browser-based form POST upload? Cloud Storage fully supports standard REST API commands (Post, Put, Get, Delete, and Head). Cloud Storage's RESTful APIs support the use of HTML forms to create and update objects. Is Cloud Storage object synchronisation (for example, protection offered at each VM type) synchronous or asynchronous? Protection is asynchronous - a single copy is created, and subsequent copies of the data are created when bandwidth allows. During busy periods, this protection can take longer to complete. Onboarding How can I get started with the service? Within five days of accepting your order, we'll create your primary administrator account and send you a welcome pack, which includes the URL for the UKCloud Portal and associated authentication details. Once you've signed up to the service, you can access your unique credentials (User ID, Subtenant ID, resolvable hostname and shared secret) through the UKCloud Portal, which you simply enter into an EMC Cloud Tiering Appliance or other compatible automated solution. Why can't I see my secret key in the UKCloud Portal? For security reasons, the UKCloud Portal only displays a secret key for a short amount of time after it is set. After this time, the secret key is replaced with the text [FILTERED]. If you forget your secret key, or if it is compromised, you can reset it by clicking the Reset secret button in the Storage section of the Portal. When you reset your secret key, you'll be able to see it in the Portal for up to 24 hours before it is hidden. Billing and legal What is the smallest unit of time I will be billed for? Storage is billed on a per-GiB per-month basis, and is based on utilisation of the storage platform across the month. The minimum amount of time is one month. How is my storage bill calculated? Used storage is calculated on a daily basis. The data for a month is collected, and the average consumption calculated and rounded up to the next whole number to provide the number of GiB consumed in a month. How can I view billing information? Billing information is provided in an evidence file on the first working day of the month for your previous months spend. How do I pay for the service and what are the termination fees? Billing for the service is one month in arrears and payment can be made by direct bank transfer. There are no termination fees for the service. You are responsible for extracting your own data from the platform if required. UKCloud may make an additional charge for transferring data out of the service. Is there a free trial? Yes, we offer a 30-day free trial so that you can test and evaluate our service without commitment. Your trial provides you with a live environment on the UKCloud platform to test our services and verify whether they are suited to your needs. Security What data is suitable for our cloud? The service is hosted in the UK and operated by security-cleared staff. It has extensive independent validation (including NCSC design reviews) that is fully aligned with the 14 NCSC Cloud Security Principles, and is therefore ideal for all data classified at Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL (including OFFICIAL SENSITIVE). Can systems on different UKCloud platforms communicate with one another? UKCloud's Cross Domain Security Zone allows customers to use the UKCloud-defined and managed UKCloud Guard or a customer-designed and managed Walled Garden to enable communication between platforms. For more information, see the Cross Domain Security Zone Service Definition on the Digital Marketplace. Is there a protective monitoring service? Yes, protective monitoring is included for our IaaS platform and follows GPG 13, more information can be found in our Protective Monitoring FAQs. ."

    "title": "Cross Domain Security Zone FAQs | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Cross Domain Security Zone FAQs Service What is the service? The UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone (CDSZ) enables customers to transfer data securely between the UKCloud Assured OFFICIAL (formerly IL2) cloud platform and the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL (formerly IL3) cloud platform using CESG-approved cross-domain security patterns. This allows solutions hosted on the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform that are citizen facing to be accessed securely from the internet. Two service options are available to enable use of the CDSZ: UKCloud Guard Walled Garden Do I have to buy other UKCloud services to use services in the CDSZ? Yes. UKCloud cross-domain services are available only to customers purchasing other UKCloud services, such as IaaS (compute and storage) or PaaS (UKCloud for OpenShift). Is there a free trial available for either service option? The complex assurance requirements mean that trials aren't available. What is the process for applying for a service in the CDSZ? You can find the information you need in the UKCloud Knowledge Centre, including a detailed description of the assurance process. How do I enable access from the internet to my solution hosted on the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform? For citizen-facing solutions hosted on the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform that need to be accessible from the internet, you can use the UKCloud Guard, or build your own solution using the Walled Garden. If you use the UKCloud Guard, you'll need to deploy additional web servers on the Assured OFFICIAL cloud platform to perform pre-authentication, validation checking and initial anti-virus. The web servers can then communicate with your application server hosted on the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform via HTTP web services through the UKCloud Guard. Use of the UKCloud Guard is subject to approval by the UKCloud SIRO. With the Walled Garden, you can create your own inspection, anti-malware and security services in the CDSZ between the internet-facing components on the Assured OFFICIAL cloud platform and the higher-security components hosted on the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform. Use of a self-managed Walled garden is subject to approval by the UKCloud SIRO. Direct connectivity into the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform via the internet is possible using a CAPS-approved VPN solution using government-grade encryption products (for example, Kryptor). CPA-approved (or equivalent standard) VPN solutions may be used subject to approval by the UKCloud SIRO. UKCloud can host the IPsec VPN gateway device within the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform, but procurement, configuration and ongoing management of the solution are your responsibility. UKCloud also offers Secure Remote Access, a CPA-approved VPN solution that allows access to the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform via a self-managed walled garden within the CDSZ. For more information, see the UKCloud Secure Remote Access service description on the Digital Marketplace. Are there any bandwidth limitations for traffic traversing the walled garden firewalls in and out of the CDSZ? Yes, there is a 1GB throughput limitation to the CDSZ in both Farnborough and Corsham. Is there storage capacity on CDSZ virtual machines (VMs)? The storage capacity of a VM in the CDSZ is 60GB. UKCloud cannot provide additional storage in the CDSZ for designs involving patch repositories. We advise customers to engage a UKCloud solutions architect to create a design that allows use of storage on the Assured or the Elevated platform. What information do I need to include in my application for a service in the CDSZ? As a minimum the application must include: A business case explaining why a cross-domain solution is required The technical architecture of the solution - incorporating either the UKCloud Guard or your proposed Walled Garden solution An assurance plan - your proposed approach to ensuring that risks are correctly identified, appropriate mitigation is implemented and residual risks are accepted, so that both the UKCloud and customer SIROs can make an informed decision about the risks of the solution UKCloud Guard What is the UKCloud Guard? UKCloud provides a secure and scalable Guard which supports structured and inspectable HTTP-based data flows. This service offers an immediately available (subject to the assurance process) multi-tenant Guard to support simple use cases. What data can the UKCloud Guard inspect? It can inspect structured and inspectable HTTP-based data such as XML and JSON. Does UKCloud support JSON and are there any 'rules' around it? Both guards (IWSVA and Deep Secure) can currently pass through JSON content. This is currently based on both products recognising the content as text. Can I change the data that's allowed to flow through the UKCloud Guard? No. Any changes to what is and isn't allowed through the guard will be decided at a service level by UKCloud. If you need a different solution, we recommend you use the Walled Garden. Can I design a redundant UKCloud Guard? Yes. You can implement a dual-site option that provides a secondary guard route in case the primary one fails. How long will the assurance process take? Each business case and proposed solution will be assessed by the UKCloud team, and must be approved by the UKCloud SIRO. We aim to carry out the assessment within five days of receiving the business case and proposed solution, but we can't commit to timelines for approval. Self-managed Walled Garden What is the self-managed Walled Garden? We provide self-service access to the CDSZ so that customers can create their own Walled gardens using the technology and application services of their choice. We provide an assurance wrap by ensuring that customers use appropriate risk management techniques to understand and mitigate identified risks. Is there a setup fee for a Walled Garden? No. What is the assurance wrap? Because a Walled Garden Solution is bespoke, we offer an assurance wrap to guide customers towards an effective design that will help to maximise their chances of meeting compliance requirements. The variable nature of Walled Garden Solutions means we may charge for the assurance wrap on an SFIA rate card basis, according to the number of days' support needed. What is the process for approving a Walled Garden? Broadly, the process is as follows: Initial application UKCloud design review (with a cloud architect) Proposed evidence pack submission (by the customer) Full evidence pack submission (by the customer) UKCloud SIRO review and approval or rejection Full details of each stage are available in the UKCloud Knowledge Centre or from your account director. What type of evidence is required to allow use of the Walled Garden? The evidence pack will generally consist of: IT Security Health Check (ITSHC) This must be carried out by an NCSC-approved security organisation Protective Monitoring solution The nature of Walled Garden solutions makes it essential that appropriate audit logging of security events and information is implemented and regularly monitored. Customer SIRO sign-off We need an accreditor's statement confirming their acceptance of the risk assessment, mitigating controls and residual risks, and their understanding of the customer's obligations relating to the use of UKCloud services What are the ongoing requirements? When the Walled Garden is in operation, the customer is responsible for ensuring continuing compliance with security operating procedures (SyOps) and other security obligations. How long will the assurance process take? The bespoke nature of the Walled Garden means we can't provide committed timescales for each phase in the process. However, we aim to provide feedback from a named source within five days of each submission. Who makes the final decision to allow or deny the use of a Walled Garden? The UKCloud SIRO is ultimately responsible for deciding which solutions and configurations are allowed. Support How do I raise a support ticket?- Our secure online Portal provides service management functionality. Alternatively, you can reach support by phone or email. How do I manage my services? Walled Gardens are managed from the higher-security side of the platform (Elevated OFFICIAL). The security requirements are much stricter and require a PSN-approved connection, UKCloud Secure Remote Access or CPA-approved (or equivalent standard) encryption. What are your service maintenance windows? UKCloud's maintenance windows are as follows (times are UK local times): Planned maintenance Any pre-planned maintenance of any infrastructure relating to the services. We'll provide you with at least 14 days' advance notice of any planned maintenance. It will take place between 00:00 and 06:00 Monday to Sunday or between 08:00 and 12:00 on a Saturday or Sunday. No planned maintenance will take place on a Saturday unless agreed in advance by both parties. Emergency Maintenance Any emergency maintenance of any infrastructure relating to the services. Whenever possible, we'll provide you with at least six hours' advance notice of emergency maintenance; and carry it out between 00:00 and 06:00 Monday to Sunday or between 08:00 and 12:00 on a Saturday or Sunday, unless there's an identified and demonstrable immediate risk to a customer's environment. Billing and legal How will I be billed? Both solutions have a minimum commitment period of one month. The billing models are as follows: UKCloud Guard Billing is based on the amount of data transferred between domains. You buy a starter pack which includes an amount of data that can be transferred. You're billed at an incremental rate for data transferred above the starter pack threshold. Walled Garden Billing is based on the solution design. You pay a monthly rental fee, with additional charges based on the number of VMs required to run the solution. How do I pay for the service? Payment can be made by direct bank transfer (BACS/CHAPS). What are the termination fees? There are no termination fees for most services. We may make an additional charge for transferring data out of the service if this is required. Security What data is suitable for the UKCloud assured cloud platform? The platform is hosted in the UK and operated by SC-cleared staff. It has extensive independent validation (including CESG PGA) that it is fully aligned with NCSC Cloud Security Principles, making it ideal for all data classified at OFFICIAL (including OFFICIAL SENSITIVE) and legacy IL0-IL4 solutions. Is there a protective monitoring service? Protective monitoring is included for our IaaS platform and follows GPG 13."

    "keywords": "How to use the Azure Stack API Overview The Azure Stack API enables you to interact programmatically with your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure environment. For example, you can use API calls to manage your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure tenancy. This guide shows you how to get started with the Azure Stack API. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have the appropriate permissions on the resource you are trying to access. Authenticating to the API Azure Stack API authentication uses access tokens to validate requests. To obtain an access token: Send a POST request to the Azure REST authentication/login endpoint: https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant_id>/oauth2/token where tenant_id is one of: Your tenant domain, for example, ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com , ukcloud.com , example.mydomain.com Your tenant ID, for example 8eaef023-2b34-4da1-9baa-8bc8c9d6a490 The default value for tenant independent keys: common Pass the following parameters in the request body: grant_type - The type of authentication scheme to use: password client_id - Hard-coded to a default value of 1950a258-227b-4e31-a9cf-717495945fc2 Other options for specific scenarios are: LegacyPowerShell - 0a7bdc5c-7b57-40be-9939-d4c5fc7cd417* PowerShell - 1950a258-227b-4e31-a9cf-717495945fc2 WindowsAzureActiveDirectory - 00000002-0000-0000-c000-000000000000 VisualStudio - 872cd9fa-d31f-45e0-9eab-6e460a02d1f1 AzureCLI - 04b07795-8ddb-461a-bbee-02f9e1bf7b46 resource - The endpoint of the resource the token will be used to access, for example, https://management.ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com/4de154de-a8a8-4017-af41-df619da68154 You can obtain the resource endpoint by querying the Azure Stack management metadata endpoint. The resource endpoint is returned in the audiences section of the response. For example, to find the endpoint for the operators resource send a request to https://adminmanagement.<region>.<AzureStackdomain>/metadata/endpoints?api-version=2015-01-01 username - The Azure Stack AAD account, for example azurestackadmin@ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com password - The password for the Azure Stack AAD account scope - optional, such as openid to get the ID token For example: grant_type=password &client_id=1950a258-227b-4e31-a9cf-717495945fc2 &resource=(endpoint returned in the audiences section below) &username=admin@ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com &password=Password123 &scope=openid Note Format the request body using the Content-Type x-www-form-urlencoded . An example request might look something like the following curl -X \"POST\" \"https://login.windows.net/160f539f-8571-4c96-9361-797645c24e75/oauth2/token\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\ --data-urlencode \"client_id=1950a258-227b-4e31-a9cf-717495945fc2\" \\ --data-urlencode \"grant_type=password\" \\ --data-urlencode \"username=admin@ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com\" \\ --data-urlencode 'password=Password12345' \\ --data-urlencode \"resource=https://management.ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com/c0a3a144-57ae-42e2-a5da-19e945a25deb\" If the authentication is successful, the endpoint returns an access token. For example: { \"token_type\": \"Bearer\", \"scope\": \"user_impersonation\", \"expires_in\": \"3599\", \"ext_expires_in\": \"0\", \"expires_on\": \"1512574780\", \"not_before\": \"1512570880\", \"resource\": \"https://management.ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com/c0a3a144-57ae-42e2-a5da-19e945a25deb\", \"access_token\": \"eyJ0eXAiOi...truncated for readability...\" } You must include this token in the Authorization header of each subsequent API request. For example: curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOi...truncated for readability...\" 'https://management.local.azurestack.external/subscriptions?api-version=2016-05-01' Calling Azure Stack API endpoints A REST request URI consists of: <URI-scheme>://<URI-host>/<resource-path>?<query-string> where: URI-scheme is the protocol used to transmit the request, for example http or https . URI-host is the domain name or IP address of the server where the REST service endpoint is hosted, for example management.local.azurestack.external . resource-path is the resource or resource collection, which may include multiple segments, used by the service in determining the selection of those resources. For example beta/applications/00003f25-7e1f-4278-9488-efc7bac53c4a/owners is the resource path to a specific application's owners within the applications collection. query-string provides additional simple parameters, such as the API version or resource selection criteria. The syntax of an Azure Stack request URI is: https://management.local.azurestack.external/<subscription-id>/resourcegroups/<resource-group>/providers/<provider>/<resource-path>?<filter-expression>&api-version=<api-version> where: subscription-id is your tenant subscription ID resource-group is the resource group you want to query provider is the provider you want to query resource-path is the resource you want to query filter-expression is an optional list of arguments to filter the results of the query api-version is the version of the Azure Stack API being called, for example api-version=2016-05-01 For example, the following API call returns information about region health: https://management.local.azurestack.external/subscriptions/800c4168-3eb1-405b-a4ca-919fe7ee42e9/resourcegroups/system.local/providers/microsoft.infrastructureinsights.admin/regionhealths/local/Alerts?$filter=(Properties/State eq 'Active') and (Properties/Severity eq 'Critical')&$orderby=Properties/CreatedTimestamp desc&api-version=2016-05-01\" Next steps For general information about the Azure API, see the Azure REST API Reference at: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/rest/api/?view=Azure In particular, you may find the following documents useful: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-protocols-oauth-code https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-authentication-scenarios https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-protocols-oauth-code https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/master/articles/azure-stack/azure-stack-provider-resource-api.md There is not currently an API reference guide for Azure Stack.

Note You only need your Service Principal Name (SPN) to be assigned to Azure Stack subscription despite what official Terraform documentation says. The process of authentication can be handled in one of two ways, either as Environment Variables or in the Provider Block . Environment Variables Option - you can create your terraform plan by putting only the plan itself into example.tf and then keep variables.tf separately. You have to declare the actual values in terraform.tfvars file. It is this file that you will need to populate with your actual credential details. Note You can also put content of variables.tf in the example.tf at the top of the file. Provider Block Option - you can create your terraform plan by putting everything in one example.tf file which then contains your Provider settings explicitly in said plan.

    "keywords": "How to create a Service Principal Name for Azure Stack - PowerShell This document explains how to create a Service Principal Name to manage Azure and Azure Stack using PowerShell. It will guide you through the creation of: an Azure application a Service Principal Name role assignment permissions What is a Service Principal Name? An Azure Service Principal Name (SPN) is a security identity used by user-created applications, services, and automation tools to access specific Azure resources. Think of it as a 'user identity' (username and password or certificate) with a specific role, and tightly controlled permissions. It only needs to be able to do specific things, unlike a general user identity. It improves security if you grant it only the minimum permissions level needed to perform its management tasks. To log in and manage your resources via SPN you'll need to create an Azure application and then assign SPN to it. Only then will you be able to perform tasks against your environment. Prerequisites Prerequisites from a Windows-based external client are: PowerShell 5.1, AzureStack and Azure AD PowerShell Modules Configure PowerShell Environment and Azure Stack Modules Azure AD PowerShell Module Install-Module AzureAD -Force -Verbose Active Azure Subscription (required to create SPN if you want to use the same SPN for both Azure and Azure Stack) Overview of the creation process for Azure and Azure Stack SPN Declare your variables accordingly. Log in to your Azure Public Subscription . Create your Azure application. Create a new Service Principal Name for the Azure application. Assign the appropriate Role to your Service Principal Name. Grant Azure AD permissions to your Azure application. Log in to the Azure Public Cloud using the SPN account. Create a new resource group using the SPN account in the Azure Public Cloud. Remove the resource group you just created from the Azure Public Cloud. Create your Azure Stack environment. Log in to your Azure Stack Subscription with administrator user credentials (needs to have Owner role). Assign the appropriate Role to your Azure application inside your Azure Stack Subscription . Log in to your Azure Stack Subscription using the SPN account. Create a new resource group using the SPN account in Azure Stack. Remove the resource group you just created from Azure Stack.

    "keywords": "UKCloud for VMware options Introduction Each enterprise application has its own set of technical and service requirements that must be addressed on an individual basis. UKCloud for VMware is completely configurable, and gives you the flexibility to use different service levels, virtual machine (VM) sizes, security domains, connectivity and data protection options. ^ All workloads include 60GB of Tier 2 storage for free, all storage is persistent and resilient to local hardware failures. Workloads can use multiple storage profiles ^^ All customers can use catalogue and template-based recovery Security domain The UKCloud provides two security domains: Assured OFFICIAL provides access to public networks, such as the internet, PSN Assured, N3/HCSN and Janet Elevated OFFICIAL provides access to restricted networks such as PSN Protected Choose the security domain your workload needs to use. Workload (VM) type Some workloads require the highest levels of resilience and performance, some are sensitive to changing conditions, whereas others merely require a reliable infrastructure. Tailor the compute characteristics of the VM to support the requirements of your workload. Choose the workload type that best suits your application: ESSENTIAL - For lower priority workloads, such as temporary applications, data processing or system modelling tasks. VMs in the VDC can have contended compute resource allocation (CPU/RAM) and automated rebalancing is enabled to ensure the workload receives the requested performance. POWER - For key workloads that are resource intensive, such as web and application workloads, mid-sized databases and caching services. VMs in the VDC have an uncontended compute resource allocation and automated rebalancing is enabled to pre-emptively optimise performance and availability. PRIORITY - For critical workloads that handle important business processes that benefit from a steady state of operation. VMs in the VDC have an uncontended compute resource allocation and automated rebalancing is configured to reduce workload movement around the platform. Storage options You can choose from a variety of options, depending on whether your workload requires high performance or longer-term retention storage. You can even deploy mixed environments to deliver exactly what you need. Choose any additional storage needed to support your application and add as many storage options as you need for the different aspects of your application. For example, you could use Tier 1 storage for the high I/O database application and Tier 2 to store seldom-accessed media. Tier 1 storage provides fast block storage, optimised for data warehouses, busy transactional databases and other high IO workloads. Tier 2 storage provides general all-purpose block storage, providing a balance of performance and cost. Geo-Resilient storage works in combination with synchronous protection to replicate storage across a SAN that spans both UKCloud sites. Data protection options Whether you're driven by recovery point (RPO) or recovery time (RTO), you can choose the right level of automated, on-platform protection for your environments. The UKCloud for VMware service offers three different protection options for your VMs. Catalogue and template-based recovery is a configuration management solution that can reprovision stateless servers to a new VM when required, using standard and catalogue-based VM templates. Snapshot Protection provides a daily backup of your VMs. You can select a retention period of either 14 or 28 days. Journaling Protection uses journals to store all write operations made to your VMs on a separate UKCloud site. Synchronous Protection provides geographical protection of your live environments across both UKCloud sites by synchronously replicating VMs between both sites. This ensures that any changes made to your environment are committed to both arrays in both sites simultaneously. Choose the application and data protection needed for your solution. You can choose only one protection option to cover both VMs and storage. For example, if you choose Journaling Protection for your VMs, you cannot then choose 14-day Snapshot Protection for your storage; Journaling Protection will apply to both.

    "href": "articles/vmware/vmw-how-zerto-perform-failover.html",
    "title": "How to perform a failover | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Overview You may want to perform a failover in the following circumstances: To recover virtual machines (VMs) after a disaster, if you're using Disaster Recovery as a Service or the UKCloud for VMware Journaling Protection option To migrate workloads from a local, on-premises environment onto the UKCloud platform With Disaster Recovery as a Service and Journaling Protection, you can also run a test failover to verify that, during recovery, your protected VMs are correctly replicated at the target site. Important During the failover process, any change in the configuration or state of the live or failed‑over VMs (for example, power on or power off) will cause failure of the failover and may corrupt the VPG. This could make a full resync necessary and, in a disaster recovery situation, could prevent failover completely. Intended audience To perform the steps in this guide you need access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal (ZSSP) in the target zone. Running a test failover If you use Disaster Recovery as a Service or Journaling Protection, you should periodically run test failovers to verify that, in the case of a live failover, your VMs can be recovered successfully. When you run a test failover, a test VM is created for each of your protected VMs in a sandbox on the target site, using the test network specified in the virtual protection group (VPG). During the test, your VMs' journals continue to be updated and new checkpoints generated, ensuring that your VMs remain protected and can be fully recovered in the event of an actual live failover. Note When the test failover has been instantiated, Zerto will automatically start up the test failover VMs. It is critically important that you do not power on (or power off) the VMs manually in vCloud Director before the failover is completely instantiated. Changing the state of the VMs in vCloud Director before the failover process is complete will result in corruption of the VPG. If you power off a failed-over VMs while a test failover is in progress, replication of live VMs will be affected. Log in to the ZSSP. For more detailed instructions, see How to access the Zerto Self-Service Portal . Use the ZSSP login link for the zone in which your target VDC is located. At the bottom of the page, make sure that the failover toggle is set to TEST and click FAILOVER . In the Failover Test wizard, in the SELECT VPGs page, select one or more VPGs that you want to test then click NEXT . The EXECUTION PARAMETERS page shows the most recent checkpoint added to the journal. If you want to use a different checkpoint for the test, click the Checkpoint time. In the Checkpoints dialog, select the checkpoint that you want to use: Latest to use the latest checkpoint Latest Tagged Checkpoint to use the latest manually added checkpoint Latest VSS to use the latest VSS snapshot (this option is applicable only for Disaster Recovery as a Service and if you've installed the Zerto VSS agent on the VM) Select from all available checkpoints to select a specific checkpoint from the list below Click OK then click NEXT . In the FAILOVER TEST page, review the diagram to see the number of VPGs and VMs included in the test and where they will be recovered to, then click START FAILOVER TEST . The test begins with an initialisation period, during which the VMs are created in scratch volumes on the target site. You can check the status of the test by clicking the VPG Name on the VPGs tab. To stop the test, on the VPGs tab, click the VPG Name and click the Stop test icon. In the Stop Test dialog, from the Result list, choose whether the test succeeded or failed, then click STOP . You can also provide additional Notes to describe the test scenario. After you stop the test, the test VMs are powered off and removed. Running a live failover In the event of a disaster, you'll need to run a live failover to recover your VMs. You can also use live failover to migrate your workloads to the target site. Note When the failover has been instantiated, Zerto will automatically start up the failover VMs. It is critically important that you do not power on (or power off) the VMs manually in vCloud Director before the failover is completely instantiated. Changing the state of the VMs in vCloud Director before the failover process is complete will result in corruption of the VPG and potentially the failure of the disaster recovery process. Log in to the ZSSP. For more detailed instructions, see How to access the Zerto Self-Service Portal . Use the ZSSP login link for the zone in which your target VDC (for recovery or migration) is located. At the bottom of the page, make sure that the failover toggle is set to LIVE and click FAILOVER . In the Failover wizard, in the SELECT VPGs page, select one or more VPGs that you want to failover or migrate then click NEXT . Tip The red border around the wizard provides a visual cue that you are performing a live failover, rather than a test. The EXECUTION PARAMETERS page shows the most recent checkpoint added to the journal. If you want to use a different checkpoint, click the Checkpoint time. In the Checkpoints dialog, select the checkpoint that you want to use: Latest to use the latest checkpoint Latest Tagged Checkpoint to use the latest manually added checkpoint Latest VSS to use the latest VSS snapshot (this option is applicable only for Disaster Recovery as a Service and Migration to the Cloud, and if you've installed the Zerto VSS agent on the VM) Select from all available checkpoints to select a specific checkpoint from the list below Click OK . The commit policy gives you the opportunity to check the integrity of the recovered or migrated VMs before committing the failover. To change the commit policy, select the Commit Policy field and choose: Auto-Commit if you want to automatically commit the failover after a specified amount of time if there is no user interaction. Set the amount of time in the After field, up to a maximum of 1440 minutes (24 hours). If you want the failover to be immediately committed, enter 0. Auto-Rollback if you want to automatically roll back the failover after a specified amount of time if there is no user interaction. Set the amount of time in the After field, up to a maximum of 1440 minutes (24 hours). If you want the failover to be immediately rolled back, enter 0. None if you do not want to apply a commit policy. You must manually commit or roll back the failover. The shutdown policy determines what happens to the source VMs in the event of a failover. To change the shutdown policy, select the VM Shutdown field and choose: No to leave the source VMs as they are before starting the failover. Yes if the source VMs have VMware Tools available so that they can be gracefully shut down before starting the failover or migration. If the VMs cannot be shut down, the failover fails. Force Shutdown to forcibly shut down the source VMs before starting the failover. Reverse protection ensures that when the source VMs are failed over to the target site, the source site becomes the new target site to ensure that the VMs are still protected. To enable reverse protection, select the Reverse Protection field and select the check box. Important Reverse protection uses the original source VM's virtual disks to pre‑seed the reverse replication, therefore enabling reverse protection will make changes to the source VMs. Click NEXT . In the FAILOVER page, review the diagram to see the number of VPGs and VMs included in the failover and where they will be recovered or migrated to, then click START FAILOVER . The failover process creates the VMs in the target site to the selected point in time. Note If a VM already exists on the target site with the same name as one of the source VMs, a number is added to the end of the recovered or migrated VM name to ensure that it's unique. If you set a commit policy with a time greater than zero, you can check the integrity of the recovered or migrated VMs before committing (or rolling back) the failover. When you've finished testing, you can either wait for the time to elapse before the auto‑commit or auto‑rollback, or on the VPGs tab, click the VPG Name and then click the Commit or Rollback icon as required. Note As soon as a live failover is committed, the journal is destroyed and you cannot go back and select a different checkpoint. However, provided reverse protection is not enabled, the original VMs on the source site remain in place. When the commit is completed, the VPG will show as being in Needs Configuration state. When in this state, editing the VPG configuration may cause reverse protection to begin. If this is not desired, then you should delete VPG as soon as it reaches the Needs Configuration state. Next steps Your VMs are now running in the target site, which is now your primary site. For Disaster Recovery as a Service and Journaling Protection, to return to the source site (or a different site) after the disaster has been resolved, perform a failover to move them to the source site. For Migration to the Cloud, as soon as you are happy with how your workloads are running in on the UKCloud platform, you can tidy up the source environment.

    "keywords": "How to manage Snapshot Protection for your VMs Overview Protection technologies are tools used to enable you to design resilience into your cloud solutions. They protect data and provide you with the ability to recover from system outages - either caused by a disruption to the physical delivery of a service or as a result of corruption of your primary system. The UKCloud platform offers a variety of protection options, including Snapshot Protection. Snapshot Protection automatically takes an image of your virtual machine (VM) every 24 hours and stores the image outside the core platform for either 14 or 28 days, depending on your chosen snapshot retention profile. How does Snapshot Protection work? By default, VMs deployed on the UKCloud platform do not come with any protection services enabled. If you want Snapshot Protection for your VM, you must explicitly add it. When you add Snapshot Protection to a VM, the VM is added to a daily automated backup. Backups are automatically taken for the VM once every 24 hours, sometime between the hours of 2000 and 0800. The status of a VM's backup is reported daily in the UKCloud Portal by 1000, but typically within minutes of the close of the backup window. If you encounter a problem with your VM, raise a Service Request and we can use one of your VM backups to restore the whole VM image to a new VM in your VDC. You can then use this image to restore the VM or restore any required data to your original VM. For more detailed information, see the Snapshot Protection Service Scope . Checking a VM's Snapshot Protection status You can use the UKCloud Portal to see whether a VM uses Snapshot Protection, find out which snapshot retention policy is currently applied to a VM, or check the status of your VM's snapshots. Log in to the UKCloud Portal. For more detailed steps, see the Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal . If necessary, switch to the account that the VM belongs to. Click My VMs . Select the compute service (vOrg) that the VM belongs to. Select the My VMs tab. From the Currently viewing for VDC list, select the VDC that the VM belongs to. Click the VMs tab. The icon in Snapshot Protection column shows the status of each VM's most recent backup: - Excluded from backup (if you have recently added Snapshot Protection to a VM, this icon indicates that a backup does not yet exist for the VM) - Backup successful - Backup unsuccessful The button in the Snapshot Protection column shows the Snapshot Protection option currently applied to the VM: 14‑day - VM uses Snapshot Protection, with backups retained for 14 days 28-day - VM uses Snapshot Protection, with backups retained for 28 days Manage - VM is currently excluded from Snapshot Protection Processing - A change in status to Snapshot Protection is currently being processed for the VM Failed - A change in the status of Snapshot Protection for the VM failed; contact the UKCloud support team to resolve this issue. To find out more detail about the most recent backup of a VM, or to view information about previous backups, click the VM name. In the VMs Info page, the following fields provide information about the most recent backup of the VM: Additional information - additional information about the backup, for example if the backup was removed from the daily automated backup, if the retention period was changed, or further details of any failures. Last backup - the status of the most recent backup Retention length - how long the backup will be kept for: 14 days or 28 days Backup status - when the most recent backup was attempted The Snapshot Protection Backups section of the page provides information about previous backups. This covers the entire retention policy period (14 or 28 days). Information includes: Status - the status of the backup Slot - the backup slot during which the backup was taken Start - the date and time when the backup started End - the date and time when the backup ended Snapshot Removal Start - the date and time when the snapshot consolidation process started (that is, writing back any changes to the VM that occurred during the time it was locked for backup) Snapshot Removal End - the date and time when the snapshot consolidation process ended The Snapshot Protection Policy History section of the page lists any recent changes to the snapshot retention policy for the VM. Status - The status of the policy change Date Requested - The date and time when the policy change was requested User - The user who requested the change Protection Period - The new protection period introduced by the policy change Reason for Change - The reason for the policy change Action - The type of policy change request Click Manage my Backups to raise a service request related to your backups, for example, to restore a backup. To view all the VM information in a single table, click the Actions tab and select Export VMs . You can save this page to view offline and analyse further. Managing Snapshot Protection for a VM By default, VMs deployed on the UKCloud platform do not come with any protection services enabled. You can use the UKCloud Portal to add Snapshot Protection to your VM. You can also use the Portal to change the snapshot retention policy for your backups and to remove Snapshot Protection from your VM. Access the My VMs tab for your compute service. For detailed steps for how to do this, see the first few steps in Checking a VM's snapshot status . From the Currently viewing for VDC list, select the VDC that the VM belongs to. Click the VMs tab. In the Snapshot Protection column, click the green button. The label on the button will depend on the currently applied policy: Manage if there is currently no snapshot retention policy applied to the VM 14-day if the VM's snapshot retention policy is currently 14 days 28-day if the VM's snapshot retention policy is currently 28 days In the Snapshot Protection Policy dialog box, from the New Protection Policy list, select the snapshot retention policy that you want to apply to the VM: 14-day to apply a 14-day snapshot retention policy to the VM 28-day to apply a 28-day snapshot retention policy to the VM No Backup to turn Snapshot Protection off for the VM > [!NOTE] > If you remove Snapshot Protection from a VM, you should consider alternatives to ensure the integrity of your data in the case of disruption. In addition to Snapshot Protection, UKCloud offers Synchronous Protection and Journaling Protection options, or you may want to implement your own protection solution, possibly utilising our Cloud Storage service. In the Reason For Change field, provide a reason for the change to the existing snapshot retention policy. Click Submit . The button in the Snapshot Protection column changes to an amber Processing button. When the changes have been applied, the button changes back to green with a label indicating the VM's snapshot retention policy ( 14-day or 28-day ) or Manage if you have turned off Snapshot Protection. The amount of time it takes for your changes to take place depends on how many requests are in the queue. If there are any problems with the request, the button in the Snapshot Protection column changes to a red Failed button; in this situation, contact UKCloud Support for further assistance. Backup status information is updated daily on the UKCloud Portal by 1000, but typically within minutes of the close of the backup window. Managing Snapshot Protection for a VDC You can specify a snapshot retention policy to apply to all the VMs in a VDC. You can apply the policy to all new VMs or to all new and existing VMs. Access the My VMs tab for your compute service. For detailed steps for how to do this, see the first few steps in Checking a VM's snapshot status . From the Currently viewing for VDC list, select the VDC that you want to apply Snapshot Protection to. Select the Snapshot Protection tab. Next to Default VM Snapshot Protection , click the green button. The label on the button will depend on the currently applied policy: Manage if there is currently no default snapshot retention policy applied to the VDC 14-day if the default snapshot retention policy is currently 14 days 28-day if the default snapshot retention policy is currently 28 days In the Snapshot Protection Policy dialog box, from the New Protection Policy list, select the snapshot retention policy that you want to apply to the VMs in this VDC: 14-day if you want to apply a 14-day snapshot retention policy to the VDC 28-day if you want to apply a 28-day snapshot retention policy to the VDC No Backup if you do not want to apply a default snapshot retention policy to the VDC In the Reason For change field, provide a reason for the change to the existing snapshot retention policy. If you want to apply the chosen snapshot retention policy to existing VMs in the VDC as well as new VMs, select the Apply new policy to all existing VMs? check box. Note If you select this check box, all existing VMs will switch to the new policy when you click Submit. You will not be able to rollback this change. Click Submit . The label of the Default VM Snapshot Protection button changes to indicate the new snapshot retention policy ( 14-day or 28-day ) or to Manage if you have turned off Snapshot Protection. Any new VMs created within the VDC will now use the specified snapshot retention policy, although you can override this for individual VMs if required by following the steps in Managing snapshot protection for a VM . If you selected Apply to all existing VMs , the button changes to an amber Processing button. When the changes have been applied, the button changes back to green with a label indicating the VDC's snapshot retention policy ( 14-day or 28-day ) or Manage if you have turned off Snapshot Protection. If the VDC contains a lot of VMs, the process of updating the policy for all existing VMs may take several minutes to complete. Backup status information is updated daily on the UKCloud Portal by 1000, but typically within minutes of the close of the backup window. Note When you exit the Snapshot Protection Policy dialog box, the Currently viewing for VDC list on the My VMs tab resets to the first VDC listed under the compute service. You'll need to reselect your VDC from the list before continuing. The Default Snapshot Protection Policy History section of the page lists any recent changes to the snapshot protection policy for the VDC. The Recent VM Snapshot Protection Policy Actions section of the page lists any recent changes to the snapshot protection policy for VMs in the VDC. Monitoring the status of Snapshot Protection You can monitor the status of Snapshot Protection across an entire compute service to get a general overview of how your VDCs and VMs are protected. Log in to the UKCloud Portal. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud Portal . If necessary, switch to the account that the compute service belongs to. In the navigation panel, expand Reports and click Backup Summary . Click the link for the compute service for which you want to view Snapshot Protection information. The Snapshot Protection Summary page provides the following information for the selected compute service: Success Rate (Last 24 Hours) - The percentage of successful VM backups in the previous night's backups Success Rate (Within Retention Period) - The overall percentage success rate of all backups across the compute service Number of VMs Protected - The total number of VMs successfully protected in the previous night's backups Number of VMs Not Protected - The total number of VMs with Snapshot Protection that were not successfully protected in the previous night's backups VM Snapshot Protection Failures - A list of the VMs that encountered a Snapshot Protection failure in previous night's backups Next steps For more information about working with your VMs, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware .

    "keywords": "How to install Red Hat Update Infrastructure on an existing virtual machine Overview This article provides advice on how to update your existing Red Hat virtual machines (VMs) to target UKCloud's approved Red Hat Update Infrastructure (RHUI). As of July 2015, UKCloud implemented an RHUI to provide automatic updates to our Red Hat customers on our Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL platforms. This provides benefits such as the reliable availability of patch updates and Red Hat approved OS templates. This update service replaces the previous repositories, which are no longer updated and were retired on the 31 August 2015. Pre-requisites There are two pre-requisites for performing this operation: The host can resolve the following DNS records: Assured: 37.26.90.194 rhua.ukcloud.com Elevated: 172.26.89.98 rhua.psn.ukcloud.com You can achieve this by configuring an A record on your local DNS, or configuring a /etc/hosts file with one of the lines above. All hosts using the service must be able to access the local RHUA server on port 443 (HTTPS). Ensure that you have configured SNAT and firewall policies on your edge gateway device. If you have any questions on this, contact UKCloud Support. Installation You can find the installer RPM files in the UKCloud public catalog under media , for example, UKCloud-RHUI-Standard-Assured . If you require the high availability (HA) package, raise a Service Request directly via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal and it will be uploaded to your private catalogue. Mount the UKCloud RHUI-***.iso to the VM (or place the contents in an accessible location such as NFS share, FTP, and so on). Install the relevant RPM. For example, for RHEL6: rpm -ivh IL2-Client-RHEL6-Standard-2.0-1.noarch.rpm . If you are installing a new RPM, such as replacing standard with HA you need to use the -force flag to overwrite the existing certificates. Clean yum: yum clean all Test the RHUI is working: yum update The first time you update from RHUI you will be prompted to accept the following two certificates: The Red Hat entitlement certificate The Client entitlement certificate Troubleshooting The primary issues you may encounter are: DNS Failure Check the DNS lookup is working and you have the correct entry for Assured and Elevated. 443 not accessible Check your firewall configuration, including local firewalls ( iptables ) and edge gateway. Ensure you have the correct destination IP entry for Assured or Elevated. Incorrect version Ensure you have installed the correct RPM for your release.

It's particularly useful if you need to route between virtual data centres (VDCs) in the same vOrg. Static routing is the only option in vCloud Director; routing protocol cannot be used. As an example, you may have a vApp network 192.168.8.0/24 routed to a VDC network called Front end network . You could create a static route to enable traffic to get to the outside IP of the vApp edge at 192.168.4.33 (a NAT will exist there). The steps for creating a static route vary depending on what type of edge gateway you're working with: Creating a static route for an advanced gateway Creating a static route for a standard edge Note We recommend that you convert your edge to an advanced gateway to access the latest vCloud Director functionality.

    "title": "Getting Started Guide for Secure Remote Access | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for Secure Remote Access Overview Intended audience This document is for customers who have: Completed the UKCloud Assurance Wrap Been approved to use the Secure Remote Access (SRA) service to manage services in the Elevated OFFICIAL security domain on the UKCloud platform Post approval Once the SRA Assurance Wrap has been approved, we'll raise a service request for the implementation of the SRA virtual data centre (vDC) and, if needed, an Elevated (formerly IL3) vDC. (If a service request for this vDC implementation already exists, a new one won't be raised.) You can track the progress of the service request using the UKCloud Portal. During creation of the UKCloud SRA vDC, we'll ask you for some additional information via the service request: Confirm the customer account number in Elevated as a new Org will be created under the account to contain the SRA vDC. The Org number will be used as an identifier when signing certificates. The preferred IP pool you want to use for your client devices. If the IP Pool you'd prefer is in use by another customer then another will have to be chosen. We'll inform you if this is the case. If you want to specify an IP from the IP pool for each device, we'll need you to supply the mapping. Any specified DNS servers. The Elevated Network Firewall Tenant (NFT) number and the Elevated organisation containing it for connection into Elevated. A certificate signing request for each remote access device. Certificate signing request generation To enable SRA access, we'll need the certificate-signing request (CSR) from each remote access device you'll be using. The certificate-generation process will vary depending on the OS of the client device. Windows Follow the steps below to generate the CSR for a Windows device. Open the Certificates MMC snap-in (click Start , click Run , type mmc and then press Enter ) select Certificates and then Computer Account . In the console tree, double-click Personal and then click Certificates . On the Actions menu, point to All Tasks , point to Advanced Options and then click Create Custom Request to start the Certificate Enrolment wizard. Click Next . On the Custom request page, in the Templates list, we recommend using the Custom Request option as your domain policy may be incompatible with the SRA service. Select Proceed without enrolment policy and click Next . Select (No template) CNG key and ensure the PKCS#10 radio button is selected, then click Next . At the Certificate Information page, click the down arrow next to Details then click the Properties button. Click the Private Key tab, then the down arrow to the right of Key options . Change the Key size to 2048 and click Apply . Optional: If you want to back up the certificate (to protect against client device failure) click the check boxes for the private key . You'll be asked for a password. For the file format, select Base 64 and then save the CSR. Linux For Linux, an equivalent OpenSSL command would be the following: openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout myserver.key -out server.csr Ensure that the key file is preserved for the later installation steps below, as withouth this the AnyConnect client will not be able to connect the SRA service. CSR submission to UKCloud We request that you paste the contents of the CSR file directly into a ticket for us to generate the associated certificate(s), but you can also email it to us if you cannot access the Portal. VPN Cisco AnyConnect client setup To access yoru SRA VDC you need to download the Cisco AnyConnect client and install it on your remote access devices. For each OS there is the main Cisco AnyConnect client software install and an additional executable to enable the FIPS capability. You need to run both. Linux Download link https://portal.ukcloud.com/support/knowledge_centre/a0e452d8-cd7b-49a4-a3ca-f791620cb084 Install the AnyConnect client tar zxvf anyconnect-linux-64-<version number>-k9.tar.gz cd anyconnect-<version number>-/vpn sudo ./vpn_install.sh Enable FIPS tar zxvf anyconnect-linux-64-<version number>-enableFIPS.tar.gz ./ anyconnect-linux-64-<version number>-enableFIPS Windows Download link https://portal.ukcloud.com/support/knowledge_centre/9af4958c-04c0-4ae1-8eb2-2733dc8042ce Install the AnyConnect client The windows installation has the option of .msi or .iso (that contains the .msi ) for the AnyConnect client image. The following installs may need to be run as administrator depending on the local policy of your Windows device. Right click on the anyconnect-win-<version number>-pre-deploy.msi and select Install. Enable FIPS Double click anyconnect-EnableFIPS-win-<version number>.exe and then enter y when asked at the command prompt. Mac Download link https://portal.ukcloud.com/support/knowledge_centre/e8b2d284-ec20-45e4-aed6-5a6071299064 AnyConnect client software We'll make the latest Cisco AnyConnect client software available via the Knowledge Centre using the links above. Using the latest version of the AnyConnect client will probably be a requirement of your ITSHC or service assurance wrap so it will be worth checking the above articles periodically. If a client is upgraded from a previous install then the following post installation steps will need to be performed again to ensure the client configuration isn't reverted to the default. Post-installation configuration Once you've installed the AnyConnect software and certificates on your device, you need to install the connection profile which is available in the Knowledge Centre ( https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/support/knowledge_centre/25a7111c-139e-4fd2-a52c-3412689bf1d3 ). Unzip the file and copy the xml to the following location: OS type CPA XML location Linux/Mac /opt/cisco/anyconnect/profile Windows C:\\ProgramData\\Cisco\\Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client\\Profile For Linux only In addition to the AnyConnect profile, you also need to install a local policy which is available in the Knowledge Centre: https://portal.ukcloud.com/support/knowledge_centre/2effd0b2-1eda-4999-87a6-6140e5fc07ea Unzip the file and copy it to: /opt/cisco/anyconnect/AnyConnectLocalPolicy.xml . Once you've copied the connection profile and local policy to the correct locations, you need to restart the AnyConnect service (using the command service vpnagentd restart ) or reboot the VM. SRA certificates Once the SRA vDC has been set up (and Elevated vDC, if needed), we'll send you an email containing the certificates we've generated (based on the CSR sent to us as above) which you need to install onto your remote access devices. For each customer SRA service a unique IssuingCA certificate is generated and used to sign each individual device certificates. The IssuingCA certificate along with the specific certificate for the device will be emailed. Both the certificates need to be installed. The certificates sent through will named as below: IssuingCA – clientcert.pem Device Certificate - E51FFC7D50C<HEX VALUE>.pem Windows certificate store Follow the steps below to import the certificates into the Windows certificate store. This assumes that you have the certificates we sent accessible to the MMC: Open the Certificates MMC snap-in (click Start , click Run , type mmc , and then press Enter ) select Certificates and then Computer Account . In the console tree, open Trusted Root Certification Authorities , right click Certificates and select All tasks – Import - Next . Click Browse , change the filter from **X.509 Certificate ( .cer, .crt) to All files . Find the IssuingCA sent to you, double click clientcert.pem and click Next . Ensure that the Place all certificates radio button has Trusted Root Certification Authorities selected then click Next then Finish . In the console tree, open Personal , right click Certificates and select All tasks – Import - Next . Click Browse , change the filter from **X.509 Certificate ( .cer, .crt) to All files . Find the device certificate sent to you, double click E51FFC7D50C .pem and click Next . Ensure that the Place all certificates radio button has Personal selected then click Next then Finish . Using the example customer SRAS-1-1-2 you should now see the client certificate in the Personal store. Double click it and as in the examples pictures below: In the General tab it should say \"You have a private key that corresponds to this certificate\". The UID should be displayed the Details tab in the Subject line in the format SRAS-1-1-2- The certification path listed in the Certification Path tab as highlighted in the example below should show the IssuingCA Linux certificate store The Linux certificate store is just a file structure under the root or user account depending on how you use Linux OS. For the Linux client to work the following must be true: All certificate files must end with the extension .pem All private key files must end with the extension .key A client certificate and its corresponding private key must have the same filename. For example client.pem and client.key Using the example customer issued certificate SRAS1-1-2-001.pem the files would be stored in the following locations for root. The key file generated above needs to moved and renamed appropriately. PEM file certificate store folders Type of certificates stored ~/.cisco/certificates/client/private/SRAS1-1-2-001.key Private keys ~/.cisco/certificates/client/SRAS1-1-2-001.pem Client certificates ~/.cisco/certificates/ca/clientcert.pem Trusted CA and root certificates Connecting to SRA Once connected to your SRA VPN, you can access your SRA walled garden via IP address or DNS name (if you have a DNS set up). Client connection methods are listed below. Linux Once you've restarted AnyConnect and installed the certificates, you can use the client with the following command line: /opt/cisco/anyconnect/bin/vpn connect sra01.ukcloud.com Or if you use a Linux desktop the client software should be available as an icon. Windows When you open the AnyConnect client you'll see a small window appear and the location of the SRA service should be populated: Click the Connect button and after a couple of status checks the client should scan the certificate store and offer the relevant certificate to initiate access. Select the certificate and click OK . Accessing the UKCloud Portal using SRA There is no direct access to the Elevated portal once the AnyConnect client connects. In most instances we'll create a virtual machine (VM) within the SRA VDC that you can VPN into in order to log in to the Elevated portal to provision and manage your SRA and Elevated VDC. Once this VM is deployed, it becomes your responsibility to manage and maintain it. This VM will be billed according to standard UKCloud billing process. Addresses to hit the Elevated portal and vCloud Director API can be obtained by raising a support ticket through the UKCloud Portal.

    "title": "How to migrate your workloads to the UKCloud platform | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to migrate your workloads to the UKCloud platform Overview UKCloud makes it easy for you to seamlessly migrate your existing workloads from a local VMware or Hyper-V powered data centre to our cloud platform. Our workload migration service is powered by Zerto, a leading provider of disaster recovery software for the cloud. Intended audience This guide is intended for users who want to migrate their workloads onto the UKCloud platform. Before you begin When you request Workload Migration, UKCloud provides you with: The IP address (from the IP range you provided to UKCloud) of the Zerto Cloud Connector (ZCC) deployed in your target VDC; you'll need this to complete the setup of the site-to-site VPN between your local environment and your UKCloud target VDC A link to the appropriate version of the Zerto Virtual Manager (ZVM) for you to deploy in your local environment A ZORG ID to identify your Zerto environment within the UKCloud platform Access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal (ZSSP) in the appropriate UKCloud zone You should consider the following: VMs must be powered on to be synchronised The operating system used by the source VMs must also be supported in the target site System requirements To use our Workload Migration service, you must have a valid, centrally managed vSphere or HyperV estate. A single hypervisor is not sufficient. The following table lists the minimum requirements for Workload Migration, based on the currently deployed version of Zerto Virtual Replication (4.5U4) on the UKCloud platform: Product Supported version Management plane VMware vCenter 4.0U1 -- 6.0U2 Microsoft SCVMM 2012 R2 and Server Core: Update Rollup 6-11 (recommended) 2012 R2 and Server Core: RTM Hosts VMWare ESX/ESXi 4.0U1-4.0U3, 4.0U4 , 4.1-6.0U1, 6.0U2 Microsoft Hyper-V 2012 R2 and Server Core Virtual Machines Hardware Version VMware Up to Version 10 Hyper-V Generation 1&2 VM migration service Connectivity Full Duplex internet connection 5Mb/s minimum IPsec VPN NA For a complete list of hypervisor features supported when using Workload Migration, see: http://s3.amazonaws.com/zertodownload_docs/4.5U4/Zerto%20Virtual%20Replication%20Operability%20Matrix.pdf Migrating workloads to UKCloud Create a target VDC Set up your local environment Configure networking on the target site Create a virtual protection group Migrate your workloads Create a target VDC To migrate your workloads to the UKCloud platform, you must have a VDC in the intended target site. If you already have a compute service in the UKCloud site, you can use an existing VDC or you can create a new one using: The UKCloud Portal (for more information see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware ) The UKCloud Portal API (for more information see the How to use the UKCloud Portal API ) If you don't already have a compute service in the UKCloud site or you'd prefer UKCloud to create the VDC for you, you can request this as part of your Workload Migration Service Request. Set up your local environment Before you can start migrating your workloads to UKCloud, you need to prepare your local environment by: Installing the appropriate version of Zerto Virtual Manager (ZVM) in your local environment Creating a secure site-to-site VPN between your local environment and the UKCloud platform For more information, see How to install and configure Zerto in your local environment . Configure networking on the target site You must configure any internally and externally routed networks in your UKCloud target VDC to duplicate those in your local environment. You must also configure the edge gateway with the same firewall, NAT and other rules. You'll create the mapping between these networks when you create your VPG. When you migrate your workloads, external access to the UKCloud VDC will be via a different IP address. You'll need to account for any required DNS changes and external connectivity configuration (such as VPNs), to ensure continued external access. Utilising UKCloud's VMware cloud, you can configure this in advance. Alternatively, you can use load balancing technologies to manage a seamless switch between environments. Create a virtual protection group A virtual protection group (VPG) is a collection of VMs that are grouped together for migration. When you create a VPG, a replica of each VM disk is created on the target UKCloud site. These replica virtual disks are then populated with the data in the source VMs by synchronising the source VMs with the target site replicas. For more information, see How to create a virtual protection group . Migrate your workloads Within Zerto, you have two options for migrating your workloads: Move the VPG to the target site. This method performs an end-to-end migration, including removing the VMs from the source site after they have been moved. For more information, see the steps below. Perform a live failover. This method provides more flexibility for you to control what happens on the source site after you move the VMs to the target site. For more information, see How to perform a failover . To move a VPG: Login to ZSSP. If you need more detailed instructions, see How to access the Zerto Self-Service Portal . Use the ZSSP login link for the zone in which your target VDC is located. From the ACTIONS menu at the bottom of the page, choose MOVE VPG . In the Move wizard, on the Select VPGs page, select one or more VPGs that you want to move then click NEXT . On the EXECUTION PARAMETERS page, the commit policy gives you the opportunity to check the integrity of the migrated VMs before committing the move. To change the commit policy, select the Commit Policy field and choose: Auto-Commit if you want to automatically commit the move after a specified amount of time if there is no user interaction. Set the amount of time in the After field, up to a maximum of 1440 minutes (24 hours). If you want the move to be immediately committed, enter 0. Auto-Rollback if you want to automatically roll back the move after a specified amount of time if there is no user interaction. Set the amount of time in the After field, up to a maximum of 1440 minutes (24 hours). If you want the move to be immediately rolled back, enter 0. None if you do not want to apply a commit policy. You must manually commit or roll back the move. The source VMs must be powered off before they can be migrated. If the VMs cannot be gracefully shut down, you can force a shutdown. To force shutdown, select the Force Shutdown check box. If you do not select this option and the VMs cannot be gracefully shut down, the move process fails. Reverse protection ensures that when the source VMs are migrated to the target site, the source site becomes the new target site. Reverse protection is enabled by default, but you can disable it by clicking the Reverse Protection field and deselecting the REVERSE check box. Click NEXT . On the MOVE page, review the diagram to see the number of VPGs and VMs included in the move and where they will be moved to, then click START MOVE . The move process creates the VMs in the target site. Note If a VM already exists on the target site with the same name as one of the source VMs, a number is added to the end of the target VM name to ensure that it is unique. If you set a commit policy with a time greater than zero, you can check the integrity of the migrated VMs before committing (or rolling back) the migration. When you've finished testing, you can either wait for the time to elapse before the auto commit or auto rollback, or on the VPGs tab, click the VPG Name and then click the Commit or Rollback icon as required. After the migrated VMs are up and running and committed in the target site, the powered off VMs in the source site are removed from the source site and data from the journal is promoted to the migrated VMs. If you enabled reverse protection, the migrated VMs are protected on the source site. Next steps To see what you can do with your application now that it's on the UKCloud platform, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware . If you used failover to migrate your workloads, when you've determined that the migration has been successful, you should remove the original VMs from the source site to remove any workloads that are no longer required.

    "keywords": "How to access UKCloud services from Walled Garden and Secure Remote Access Overview If you've implemented either Secure Remote Access (SRA) or a Cross Domain Security Zone (CDSZ) Walled Garden solution and want to access UKCloud services (such as WSUS, KMS or Red Hat Update Service), you'll need to edit your edge gateway settings to enable access. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have vCloud Director administrator access to a virtual data centre (VDC) in the Elevated OFFICIAL security domain. Before you begin Before making network changes to your environment, you'll need the following information: The Transit IP for the Elevated edge gateway of your CDSZ or SRA VDC The Transit IP for the edge gateway of your Elevated VDC The IP of the service you require. To get the last two octets of the IP addresses for the service you require, please raise a support ticket on the UKCloud Elevated Portal. Setting up access to UKCloud services The diagrams below show that you need to add two static routes and an SNAT rule on two edge gateways. In vCloud Director, locate the edge gateway that is attached to the Elevated side in your CDSZ or SRA VDC. Create a static route that directs traffic for the service you need via the Transit IP of your Elevated edge gateway. For more detailed instructions, see How to create a static route . Create an SNAT rule on your Elevated VDC to allow the private IP range from your CDSZ or SRA to have external access. For more detailed instructions, see How to create NAT rules . Amend the firewall to allow the private IP range access to the service you require on your Elevated VDC. For more detailed instructions, see How to create firewall rules Add a static route for the return traffic on your Elevated VDC to point to the Transit IP of your CDSZ or SRA VDC. Next steps Now that you've set up access to UKCloud services, you can register your VMs with those services.

    "keywords": "How to create an Azure user group Overview UKCloud for Microsoft Azure provides you with three default user groups to get you started: AzureStackOperators - Members of this group have Owner permissions and have full access to all resources and can manage access to resources AzureStackUsers - Members of this group have Contributor permissions and can create and manage all resources but cannot manage access to resources AzureStackReadOnly - Members of this group have Reader permissions and can view everything but cannot make changes If these default groups do not meet your requirements, for example, if you've created a custom role and want to grant users the permissions specified by that role, you can create new groups and assign roles and permissions to them. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have global administrator access to the Azure portal and Owner access to the Azure Stack portal. Creating a group for Azure users Rather than granting permissions to individual users, we recommend that you first create a group and add your Azure users to that group. To create a group in the Azure portal: Log in to the Azure portal as a global administrator: https://portal.azure.com Navigate to the Azure Active Directory . Tip You can find the Azure Active Directory by selecting All services and scrolling down to the Security + Identity section. Select Groups and then All groups . Click the New group option. From the Group type list, select Security . In the Group name field, enter a name for the group, for example, AzureStackGroup . In the Group description field, enter a brief, but meaningful description for the group. From the Membership type list, select Assigned . Click Create . To add users to the group, open the group, select Members then click Add members . Granting Azure permissions After setting up the user group in Azure, you need to go to the Azure Stack portal to grant the appropriate permissions to the group. To grant Azure permissions to a group: Log in to the Azure Stack portal: https://portal.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com/ Navigate to Subscriptions . Tip If you can't see Subscriptions in your favourites panel, click More services and then Subscriptions . You can add Subscriptions to your favourites panel by clicking the star icon. Select your subscription for UKCloud for Microsoft Azure. Select Access control (IAM) . Click the Add option. From the Role list, select the appropriate role that you want to assign to the group.
