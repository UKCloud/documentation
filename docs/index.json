You can sign in to the Azure Stack Hub environment either as a user or as a service principal . Sign in as a user : You can either specify the username and password directly within the az login command or authenticate by using a browser. You have to do the latter if your account has multi-factor authentication enabled. Example of username : Active directory global administrator or user account i.e. username@<aadtenant>.onmicrosoft.com or username@domain.com az login -u \" user@contoso.onmicrosoft.com \" -p ' Password123! ' Note If your user account has multi-factor authentication enabled, you can use the az login command without providing the -u parameter. Running the command gives you a URL and a code that you must use to authenticate. Caution If the user is not present in the domain that you are attempting to login to, you must specify the --tenant parameter. For example, if your guest user is user@contoso.onmicrosoft.com and the domain is fabrikam@onmicrosoft.com the command will be as follows: az login --tenant fabrikam@onmicrosoft.com To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code xxxxxxxxx to authenticate. At the user authentication page, sign in with your guest user user@contoso.onmicrosoft.com . Sign in as a service principal : Before you sign in, create a service principal through the public Azure portal , PowerShell or CLI and assign it a role. Now, sign in by using the following command: az login \\ --tenant <Azure Active Directory Tenant name. For example: contoso.onmicrosoft.com> \\ --service-principal \\ -u <Application Id of the Service Principal> \\ -p <Key generated for the Service Principal> Verify that your environment is set correctly and that AzureStackUser is the active cloud. bash-5.0# az cloud list --output table IsActive Name Profile ---------- ----------------- ----------------- False AzureCloud latest False AzureChinaCloud latest False AzureUSGovernment latest False AzureGermanCloud latest True AzureStackUser 2019-03-01-hybrid Note The final line shows that the user profile has been updated and is active.

Use the following command to create a resource group named \"MyResourceGroup\": az group create -n MyResourceGroup -l frn00006 If the resource group is created successfully, the previous command outputs the following properties of the newly created resource: { \"id\": \"/subscriptions/{removed}/resourceGroups/MyResourceGroup\", \"location\": \"frn00006\", \"managedBy\": null, \"name\": \"MyResourceGroup\", \"properties\": { \"provisioningState\": \"Succeeded\" }, \"tags\": null, \"type\": null } To remove the above resource group, run the following command: az group delete -n MyResourceGroup Known issues There are some known issues that you must be aware of when using CLI in Azure Stack Hub: The CLI interactive mode i.e the az interactive command is not yet supported in Azure Stack Hub. To get the list of virtual machine images available in Azure Stack Hub, use the az vm image list --all command instead of the az vm image list command. Specifying the --all option makes sure that response returns only the images that are available in your Azure Stack Hub environment. Virtual machine image aliases that are available in Azure may not be applicable to Azure Stack Hub. When using virtual machine images, you must use the entire URN parameter (Canonical:UbuntuServer:14.04.3-LTS:1.0.0) instead of the image alias. This URN must match the image specifications as derived from the az vm image list -all command.

    "keywords": "How to automatically backup and restore files and folders on Azure Stack Hub VMs using PowerShell Overview Recovery Services vaults store all backups and recovery points you create over time, and contain the backup policy applied to backed up machines. This article explains how to set up the Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS) agent to backup and restore files and folders from Azure Stack Hub VMs to Recovery Services vaults. Note By default a new Recovery Services vault will be created by the code below. If you do not wish to create one - you can use the ExistingVault switch in the AzureBackupConfig script . Microsoft documentation MARS agent support matrix Backup Windows machines using MARS MARS agent backup process Prerequisites To complete the steps in this article, you must have appropriate access to a subscription in both the public Azure and Azure Stack Hub portals. Important The MARS agent is only supported on Windows VMs. Linux VMs are not supported. Backup Setup the MARS agent using PowerShell You can find the script used in this article here .

By default it will backup all drives </form> Create a public Azure and Azure Stack Hub service principal name (SPN) . From an elevated (administrator) PowerShell console, run either the custom script extension or PowerShell script to download the required module and execute the backup process. The PowerShell script must be run from inside the target VM, whereas the custom script extension can be executed from a local machine. Important As the MARS script will be pulled from GitHub the VM must have internet access. Custom script extension PowerShell script Warning Spaces are not permitted within the individual script arguments passed to the Set-AzVMCustomScriptExtension cmdlet. For example, Monday, Thursday should be passed as Monday,Thursday . This also means that you cannot have any spaces in the folders to backup, e.g. C:\\My Folder . If these are required, you must use the alternative PowerShell script and execute the code inside the VM itself. # Initialise environment and variables # Declare endpoint $ArmEndpoint = \" https://management.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com \" # Add environment Add-AzEnvironment -Name \"AzureStackUser\" -ArmEndpoint $ArmEndpoint # Login Connect-AzAccount -EnvironmentName \"AzureStackUser\" # Get location of Azure Stack Hub $Location = (Get-AzLocation).Location # Input variables $ClientId = \" 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 \" $ClientSecret = ' ftE2u]iVLs_J4+i-:q^Ltf4!&{!w3-%=3%4+}F2jk]= ' $TenantId = \" contoso.onmicrosoft.com \" $AzureResourceGroup = \" AzureStackBackupRG \" $VaultName = \" AzureStackVault \" $EncryptionKey = \" ExampleEncryptionKey \" $AzureLocation = \" ukwest \" $BackupDays = \" Wednesday,Sunday \" $BackupTimes = \" 10:00 \" $RetentionLength = \" 7 \" $FoldersToBackup = \" C:\\Users,C:\\Temp \" $RGName = \" MyResourceGroup \" $VMName = \" MyVM \" $CustomScriptFileName = \" AzureBackupConfig.ps1 \" $FileUri = \" https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UKCloud/AzureStack/master/Users/Extensions/Windows/AzureBackupConfig.ps1 \" $ScriptArguments = \"-ClientId $ClientId -ClientSecret $ClientSecret -TenantId $TenantId -AzureResourceGroup $AzureResourceGroup -VaultName $VaultName -EncryptionKey $EncryptionKey -AzureLocation $AzureLocation -BackupDays $BackupDays -BackupTimes $BackupTimes -RetentionLength $RetentionLength -FoldersToBackup $FoldersToBackup -BackupNow\" $CommandToExecute = \"$CustomScriptFileName $ScriptArguments\" # Add custom script extension to existing Windows VM Write-Output -InputObject \"Adding custom script extension to VM: $VMName.\" Set-AzVMCustomScriptExtension -FileUri $FileUri -VMName $VMName -ResourceGroupName $RGName -Name $CustomScriptFileName -Location $Location -Run $CommandToExecute -SecureExecution Tip If the script fails and you need to see detailed error messages, the custom script extension logs can be found in the below folder on the virtual machine: C:\\Packages\\Plugins\\Microsoft.Compute.CustomScriptExtension\\X.X.X\\Status # Declare variables $ScriptPath = \"C:\\Users\\$env:USERNAME\\Downloads\" $ScriptName = \"AzureBackupConfig.ps1\" $ClientId = \" 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 \" $ClientSecret = ' ftE2u]iVLs_J4+i-:q^Ltf4!&{!w3-%=3%4+}F2jk]= ' $TenantId = \" contoso.onmicrosoft.com \" $AzureResourceGroup = \" AzureStackBackupRG \" $VaultName = \" AzureStackVault \" $EncryptionKey = \" ExampleEncryptionKey \" $AzureLocation = \" ukwest \" $BackupDays = \" Wednesday,Sunday \" $BackupTimes = \" 10:00 \" $RetentionLength = \" 7 \" $FoldersToBackup = \" C:\\Users,C:\\Temp \" $FileUri = \" https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UKCloud/AzureStack/master/Users/Extensions/Windows/AzureBackupConfig.ps1 \" $ScriptArguments = \"-ClientId $ClientId -ClientSecret $ClientSecret -TenantId $TenantId -AzureResourceGroup $AzureResourceGroup -VaultName $VaultName -EncryptionKey $EncryptionKey -AzureLocation $AzureLocation -BackupDays $BackupDays -BackupTimes $BackupTimes -RetentionLength $RetentionLength -FoldersToBackup $FoldersToBackup -BackupNow\" # Download the AzureBackupConfig.ps1 script Write-Output -InputObject \"Downloading AzureBackupConfig.ps1 script...\" $OutPath = Join-Path -Path $ScriptPath -ChildPath $ScriptName Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $FileUri -OutFile $OutPath # Run the AzureBackupConfig.ps1 script Write-Output -InputObject \"Running AzureBackupConfig.ps1 with provided parameters.\" powershell -Command \"$ScriptPath\\$ScriptName $ScriptArguments\" Restore Restore files and folders using the MARS agent GUI On your desktop, click the Microsoft Azure Backup shortcut.

This article shows you how to create a pool of back-end servers and a load balancer to spread traffic across them. In this example, the load balancer spreads traffic across two web servers. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide, you must have appropriate access to a subscription in the Azure Stack Hub portal. Creating a load balancer In this section we'll create a load balancer with a public IP address. Log in to the Azure Stack Hub portal. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for Microsoft Azure . In the favourites panel, select Create a resource . In the New blade, select Networking . In the Featured section, select Load Balancer . In the Create load balancer blade, enter the following information: Subscription - This is your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure subscription and will be pre-populated by default. Resource group - Select an existing resource group, or create a new one by clicking the Create new link and then typing a name for your new resource group in the pop out window. Name - The name of the load balancer. Region - This will be frn00006 , which is the location of the Azure Stack Hub. Type - You can use internal load balancers to balance traffic from private IP addresses. Public load balancers can balance traffic originating from public IP addresses. For this example we will be creating a public load balancer. Public IP address - The public IP address that will be assigned to this load balancer. To create a new public IP address: Select Create new from the Public IP address options. Enter a name for the public IP address. Select either Dynamic or Static from the Assignment options. We recommend selecting the Static option when creating a load balancer. Click Review + create , then click Create on the review blade. Create back-end servers In this section we'll create a virtual network and two virtual machines which exist on this network. This will form the back-end pool of the load balancer. Create a virtual network In the favourites panel, select Create a resource . In the New blade, select Networking . In the Featured section, select Virtual network . In the Create virtual network blade, enter the following information: Basics tab Subscription - This is your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure subscription and will be pre-populated by default. Resource group - Select an existing resource group, or create a new one by clicking the Create new link and then typing a name for your new resource group in the pop out window. Name - The name of the virtual network. Region - This will be frn00006 , which is the location of the Azure Stack Hub. IP Addresses tab IPv4 address space - The virtual network's address range in CIDR notation (for example, 192.168.1.0/16). Subnet name - The name of the first subnet within the virtual network. Subnet address range - The subnet's address range in CIDR notation (for example, 192.168.1.0/24). It must be contained by the address space of the virtual network. The address range of a subnet which is in use can't be edited. Click Review + create , then click Create on the review blade. Create the virtual machines In the favourites panel, select Create a resource . In the New blade, select Compute . In the Compute blade, select the template that you want to use for your VM. In the Create virtual machine blade, in the Basics step, enter general information about the VM, including a name, credentials and resource group. Click Change size under the currently selected VM size to view all the available sizes. Select the appropriate size for your VM, depending on its purpose, then click Select . For information about the different available VM sizes, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-vm-sizes . Tip By default, the list shows a selection of recommended VM sizes. To see all available VM sizes, click See all sizes . The VM needs to belong to an availability set. To create a new availability set: Select Availability set from the Availability options dropdown. Select Create new under the new Availability set dropdown. In the Create new blade, enter a Name for the availability set, select the number of Fault domains and Update domains , then click OK . After completeing information on the Basics tab, select the Networking tab. Ensure that the Virtual network and Subnet you created earlier are selected, then click Review + create In the Review + create step, review the selections you've made and then click Create to start the deployment. Create another VM, ensuring that the Availability set , Virtual network , Subnet and Network Security Group are the same. Create network security group rules In this section we'll create network security group (NSG) rules to allow inbound traffic. Note For testing purposes, we'll create a rule to allow all inbound traffic on port 80 (HTTP) in order to access the web server home page on both of the virtual machines. Navigate to your network security group by clicking All services in the favourites panel, then selecting Network security groups under the Networking section. Select the network security group your VMs are using from the list. In the blade for your network security group, select Inbound security rules under the Settings section. Click the Add button. In the Add inbound security rule blade, enter the following information: Source - The source filter can be Any, an IP address range, or a default tag. It specifies the incoming traffic from a specific source IP address range that will be allowed or denied by this rule. Source port ranges - Provide a single port, such as 80; a port range, such as 1024-65535; or a comma-separated list of single ports and/or port ranges, such as 80,1024-65535. This specifies which ports traffic will be allowed or denied by this rule. Use an asterisk (*) to allow traffic on any port. Destination - The destination filter can be Any, an IP address range, or a default tag. It specifies the outgoing traffic for a specific destination IP address range that will be allowed or denied by this rule. Destination port ranges - Provide a single port, such as 80; a port range, such as 1024-65535; or a comma-separated list of single ports and/or port ranges, such as 80,1024-65535. This specifies which ports traffic will be allowed or denied by this rule. Use an asterisk (*) to allow traffic on any port. Protocol - Select whether to allow inbound traffic using UDP, TCP or both. Action - Select whether the rule allows or denies the traffic specified. Priority - Rules are processed in priority order; the lower the number, the higher the priority. We recommend leaving gaps between rule priority numbers, for example, 100, 200, 300, so that it's easier to add new rules without having to edit existing rules. Name - The name of the security rule. Description - A description of the security rule. Click Add . Create a back-end address pool To spread traffic load across the VMs, you must create a back-end address pool. This pool contains the IP addresses of the VMs. Navigate to your load balancer by clicking All services in the favourites panel, then selecting Load balancers under the Networking section. From the list, select the load balancer you created earlier. In the blade for your load balancer, select Backend pools under the Settings section. Click the Add button. In the Add backend pool blade, enter a name for the backend pool. Select the virtual network you created earlier. Select Virtual machines for the Associated to option. Click the Add button in the Virtual machines section. In the Add virtual machines to backend pool blade, select the two virtual machines you created earlier amd click Add . Click the Add button at the bottom of the the Add backend pool blade. Create a health probe When creating a load balancer, you can use a health probe to monitor the status of your application. In Azure Stack Hub, the health probe adds and removes VMs from the load balancer back-end pool based on their current status. Note Again, for testing purposes, we'll create the health probe to monitor traffic on port 80 (HTTP). Navigate to your load balancer by clicking All services in the favourites panel, then selecting Load balancers under the Networking section. From the list, select the load balancer you created earlier. In the blade for your load balancer, select Health Probes under the Settings section. Click the Add button. In the Add health probe blade, enter the following information: Name - The name of your health probe. Protocol - The protocol that the health probe uses to monitor the status of your VMs. Port - The port that the health probe uses to monitor the status of your VMs. Interval - The number of seconds between probe attempts. Unhealthy threshold - The number of consecutive probe failures that must occur before a virtual machine is considered unhealthy and is removed from the pool. Click OK . Create a load balancing rule A load balancer rule defines how traffic is distributed between VMs. The rule listens for traffic on a front-end IP address, then distributes it among the back-end pool. Note Again, for testing purposes, we'll create the load balancer rule for port 80 (HTTP). Navigate to your load balancer by clicking on All services in the favourites panel, then selecting Load balancers under the Networking section. From the list, select the load balancer you created earlier. In the blade for your load balancer, select Load balancing rules under the Settings section. Click the Add button. In the Add load balancing rule blade, enter the following information: Name - The name of your load balancing rule. Frontend IP address - Clients communicating with this load balancer on the selected IP address and service will have their traffic routed to the target virtual machine by this NAT rule. Protocol - The protocol that the rule redirects traffic for. Port - The front-end port that the rule listens on. Backend port - You can choose to route traffic to the virtual machines in the back-end pool using a different port than the one clients use to communicate with the load balancer. Backend pool - The virtual machines in the selected back-end pool will be the target for the load-balanced traffic of this rule. Select the pool that you created in the previous section. Health probe - The selected probe is used by this rule to determine which virtual machines in the back-end pool are healthy and can receive load-balanced traffic. Select the probe that you created in the previous section. Session persistence - Session persistence specifies that traffic from a client should be handled by the same virtual machine in the back-end pool for the duration of a session. None specifies that successive requests from the same client may be handled by any virtual machine. Client IP specifies that successive requests from the same client IP address will be handled by the same virtual machine. Client IP and protocol specifies that successive requests from the same client IP address and protocol combination will be handled by the same virtual machine. Idle timeout (minutes) - Keep a TCP or HTTP connection open without relying on clients to send keep-alive messages. Floating IP (direct server return) - Can be enabled to change the IP address mapping scheme to allow for additional flexibility, see here for further details. Click OK . Test the load balancer After installing the application that is being load-balanced on each of the VMs, the load balancer is ready to test. Navigate to your load balancer by clicking All services in the favourites panel, then selecting Load balancers under the Networking section.

Creating a new key vault Before creating a Service Fabric cluster, it is necessary to create a key vault to store the certificates for the cluster. These certificates are used in Service Fabric to provide authentication and encryption to secure various aspects of a cluster and its applications. You can find more information about these certificates here . Log in to the Azure Stack Hub portal. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for Microsoft Azure . In the favourites panel, select Create a resource . In the New blade, select Security + Identity . In the Security + Identity blade, select Key Vault . In the Create key vault blade, enter the following information: Basics tab Subscription - This is your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure subscription. Resource group - Select an existing resource group, or create a new one by clicking the Create new link and then typing a name for your new resource group in the pop-out window. Key vault name - The name of the key vault. Region - This will be frn00006 , which is the Azure Stack Hub region. Pricing tier - Azure Stack Hub only offers the Standard pricing tier. Access policy tab Enable Access to: - Select the first two check boxes to allow access to the key vault for virtual machines and the Azure Resource Manager. Current Access Policies - Select +Add access policy to configure the permissions that a user, group or service principal has to the key vault. Click Review + create . On the Review + create tab, review the selections you've made and then click Create to start the deployment. You can monitor the progress of your key vault's deployment by clicking the Notifications icon. Adding a certificate to the key vault Once the key vault has been deployed, navigate to it by clicking All services in the favourites panel, then selecting Key Vaults under the Security section. Select your key vault from the list. In the Settings section of the key vault blade, select Secrets . On the Secrets page, click the + Generate/Import button. In the Create a secret blade, enter the following information: Upload options - Select the Certificate option. Upload certificate - Select the .pfx certificate to upload. Name - The name of the certificate to identify it within the Key Vault. Activation Date - Specifies when the certificate will become active. Expiration Date - Specifies when the certificate will become inactive. Enabled - Indicates whether or not the secret data can be retrieved. Click Create . Repeat as necessary, depending on how many certificates you require. Gathering key vault and certificate information During configuration of the Service Fabric cluster, you must provide several details relating to the key vault and certificates. Once you have deployed the key vault, navigate to it by clicking All services in the favourites panel, then selecting Key Vaults under the Security section. Select your key vault from the list. In the Settings section of the key vault blade, select Properties . Copy the Resource ID and store it for later use. In the Settings section of the key vault blade, select Secrets . On the Secrets blade, select the certificate you added in the previous section. On the certificate's blade, select the current version. Copy the Secret Identifier . Repeat for each certificate that you are going to use for the Service Fabric cluster. You also need the thumbprint of the certificate(s). For information about how to find this information, see here . Create a Service Fabric cluster In the favourites panel, select Create a resource . In the search bar, search for Service Fabric Cluster . Select Service Fabric Cluster and click Create . In the Basics blade, enter the following information and click OK : Service Fabric Cluster Name - The name of your cluster. Node Type Prefix - Prefix for the name of each node (VM). Primary Node Type Size - Size of the VM scale set for the primary node type. Additional Node Type Sizes - For every additional node type, add an array with a count of the nodes in each node type. For example, if you want two additional node types with three nodes in each, enter 3,3 (separating the amount of nodes for each node type with a comma). Admin Username - The admin username for each node. Password - The admin password for each node. DNS Service - Select Yes to use DNS service, which is an optional system service that enables you to map DNS names to a service name and discover other services using the DNS protocol. If you have applications with existing URLs that you intend to use with Service Fabric, DNS service will help you use the standard DNS protocol (as an alternative to the Service Fabric Naming service) for resolving service names. Repair Manager - Select Yes to use Repair Manager to enable patch orchestration on node types with a durability of bronze, which helps keep your VMs up to date. Service Fabric deployment package URL - Specify the URL to download the Service Fabric deployment package from. For disconnected scenarios, download the service fabric package from the URL specified and upload it to a blob, then enable anonymous access and specify the URL here. Service Fabric runtime package URL - Specify the URL to download the Service Fabric runtime package from. For disconnected scenarios, download the service fabric runtime from the URL specified and upload it to a blob, then enable anonymous access and specify the URL here. Warning There are compatibility issues between the latest release of Service Fabric and its corresponding SDK. Until this issue is addressed, provide the following parameters to the deployment package URL and runtime package URL. Your deployments will fail otherwise. Service Fabric deployment package URL: https://download.microsoft.com/download/8/3/6/836E3E99-A300-4714-8278-96BC3E8B5528/6.5.641.9590/Microsoft.Azure.ServiceFabric.WindowsServer.6.5.641.9590.zip Service Fabric runtime package URL: https://download.microsoft.com/download/B/0/B/B0BCCAC5-65AA-4BE3-AB13-D5FF5890F4B5/6.5.641.9590/MicrosoftAzureServiceFabric.6.5.641.9590.cab For disconnected deployments, download these packages from the specified location and host them locally on an Azure Stack Hub Blob.

    "keywords": "How to create a service principal name for Azure Stack Hub using Azure CLI This article explains how to create a service principal name (SPN) to manage Azure and Azure Stack Hub using Azure CLI. It will guide you through the creation of: An Azure application A service principal name Role assignment Permissions What is a service principal name? An Azure SPN is a security identity used by user-created applications, services, and automation tools to access specific Azure resources. Think of it as a 'user identity' (username and password or certificate) with a specific role, and tightly controlled permissions. It only needs to be able to do specific things, unlike a general user identity. It improves security if you grant it only the minimum permissions level needed to perform its management tasks. To log in and manage your resources via SPN you'll need to create an Azure application and then assign SPN to it. Only then will you be able to perform tasks against your environment. Prerequisites Azure CLI Configure Azure CLI Environment for Azure Stack Hub Active Azure Subscription (required to create SPN if you want to use the same SPN for both Azure and Azure Stack Hub) Microsoft documentation Service Principal Name commands for 2018-03-01-hybrid profile Create an Azure Service Principal Name with Azure CLI 2.0 for 2018-03-01-hybrid profile Note There is currently no documentation for the 2019-03-01-hybrid profile. Overview of the creation process for Azure Stack Hub SPN Prepare your Azure Stack Hub CLI environment - Configure Azure CLI Environment for Azure Stack Hub . Create your Azure Stack Hub environment. Log in to your Azure Stack Hub Subscription with administrator user credentials (needs to have Owner role). Create Azure application, SPN, and assign Role . Note Unlike PowerShell, Azure CLI creates an Azure application, creates an SPN and assigns Roles to the SPN in one command. Log in to your Azure Stack Hub Subscription using the SPN account. Create a new resource group using the SPN account in Azure Stack Hub. Remove the resource group you just created from Azure Stack Hub. Declare variables Enter details below to provide values for the variables in the scripts in this article: Variable Variable description Input Azure Stack Hub DNS Suffix The DNS suffix for Azure Stack Hub (<region>.<External Domain Name>) </form> Username Your AAD username </form> Password Your AAD password </form> SPN Name The name of the SPN to be created </form> Create service principal name for Azure Stack Hub with Set Password # Create your environment az cloud register -n AzureStackUser --endpoint-resource-manager \"https://management. frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com \" --suffix-storage-endpoint \" frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com \" --suffix-keyvault-dns \".vault. frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com \" --endpoint-active-directory-graph-resource-id \"https://graph.windows.net/\" --profile 2019-03-01-hybrid # Set your environment az cloud set -n AzureStackUser # Log in to Azure Stack Hub with user credentials az login -u \" user@contoso.onmicrosoft.com \" -p ' Password123!

    "keywords": "How to create a virtual machine using the Azure CLI Overview With UKCloud for Microsoft Azure, you can leverage the power of Microsoft Azure to create virtual machines (VMs) for your on-premises applications. As UKCloud for Microsoft Azure is built on UKCloud's assured, UK-sovereign multi-cloud platform, those applications can work alongside other cloud platforms, such as Oracle, VMware and OpenStack, and benefit from native connectivity to non-cloud workloads in Crown Hosting and government community networks, including PSN, HSCN and RLI. Prerequisites Before you begin, ensure your Azure CLI environment is set up as detailed in Configure the Azure Stack Hub user's Azure CLI environment . Creating a virtual machine When you've created the resource group, you must choose which image template to use for your VM. To obtain a list of available images run the following command: az vm image list --all --output table You are retrieving all the images from server which could take more than a minute. To shorten the wait, provide '--publisher', '--offer' or '--sku'. Partial name search is supported.

In the Create a managed disk blade, enter the following information: Subscription - This will be your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure subscription. Resource group - Select an existing resource group, or create a new one by clicking the Create new link and then typing a name for your new resource group in the pop out window. Disk name - The name of the disk. Region - This will be the location of the Azure Stack Hub. Source type - Select Snapshot . Source snapshot - Select the previously created snapshot. Size - This will be set to the size of the source disk that the snapshot was created from. Note You can increase the size if necessary, but you cannot decrease it below the original size. When you're done, click the Review + create button and then the Create button to create the disk. You can monitor the progress of the disk creation by clicking the Notifications icon. Creating a virtual machine from a managed disk In the favourites panel, select All services , then, in the Compute section, select Disks . From the list, click the name of the disk that you want to create a virtual machine from. If you have been following this guide from the start, then this will be the disk that you just created from the snapshot. In the new blade for the selected disk, under Overview , ensure that Disk state is listed as Unattached . Important If your disk is not in the Unattached state, you will have to delete the virtual machine object it is attached to. You can only detach data disks, not OS disks, from a virtual machine. At the top of the blade, click Create VM . In the Create a virtual machine blade, in the Basics step, enter general information about the VM, including a name, credentials and resource group. Click Change size under the currently selected VM size to view all the available sizes. Select the appropriate size for your VM, depending on its purpose, then click Select . For information about the different available VM sizes, see here . Change any of the optional settings located in the other tabs, then click Review + create . Important There will be no public inbound ports open on the network security group if left unchanged. Note By default, boot diagnostics will be switched on for the virtual machine. In the Review + create step, review the selections you've made and then click Create to start the deployment. You can monitor the progress of your VM's deployment by clicking the Notifications icon.

Before you begin, ensure your PowerShell environment is set up as detailed in Configure the Azure Stack Hub user's PowerShell environment . High-level Process Overview Generalise the virtual machine. Create a new resource group. Important The image must be created in the same resource group that you are planning to create the new virtual machine in. In other words, we are creating a new resource group to contain the image and the new virtual machine. Create a custom image from the virtual machine, ensuring that it is created in the new resource group. Delete the virtual machine. Deploy a second virtual machine from the image, which can only be created in the new resource group. Delete the resource group which contained the original virtual machine. Warning The last step is only applicable if there are no other resources, such as other virtual machines, in the original resource group.

    "keywords": "How to create a virtual machine using the UKCloud Azure Stack Hub portal Overview With UKCloud for Microsoft Azure, you can leverage the power of Microsoft Azure to create virtual machines (VMs) for your on-premises applications. As UKCloud for Microsoft Azure is built on UKCloud's assured, UK-sovereign multi-cloud platform, those applications can work alongside other cloud platforms, such as Oracle, VMware and OpenStack, and benefit from native connectivity to non-cloud workloads in Crown Hosting and government community networks, including PSN, HSCN and RLI. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide, you must have appropriate access to a subscription in the Azure Stack Hub portal. Creating a virtual machine VMs provide the basic compute building blocks in Azure Stack Hub. You can create VMs using the Azure Stack Hub Marketplace, which provides access to pre-created images to quickly deploy the VMs you need to build your applications. Microsoft makes Azure Marketplace images available for Azure Stack Hub once they have passed an accreditation process. If you cannot find the image you require in the Azure Stack Hub Marketplace please raise a support call via the UKCloud portal and if possible we will make your requested image available in Azure Stack Hub Marketplace. To create a VM from the Azure Marketplace: Log in to the Azure Stack Hub portal. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for Microsoft Azure . In the favourites panel, select Create a resource . In the New blade, select Compute . In the Compute blade, select the template that you want to use for your VM. In the Create a virtual machine blade, in the Basics step, enter general information about the VM, including a name, credentials and resource group. Still in the Basics step, click Change size under the currently selected VM size to view all the available sizes. Select the appropriate size for your VM, depending on its purpose, then click Select . For information about the different available VM sizes, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-vm-sizes . Change any of the optional settings located in the other tabs, then click Review + create . Note For storage, managed disks are selected by default ( Disks step). Important There will be no public inbound ports open on the network security group if left unchanged ( Networking step). Note By default, boot diagnostics will be switched on for the virtual machine ( Management step). In the Review + create step, review the selections you've made and then click Create to start the deployment. You can monitor the progress of your VM's deployment by clicking the Notifications icon. Click the deployment notification for the deployment to view details of the deployment of the VM and its resources. When the deployment is finished, the notification will change to Deployment succeeded . After your VM has deployed, you can view it by clicking Virtual machines in the favourites panel.

    "title": "How to create a virtual machine using Terraform",
    "keywords": "How to create a virtual machine using Terraform on Azure Stack Hub This document explains how to create a VM using the azurestack Terraform provider with Service Principal Name authentication. Prerequisites Prerequisites from a Windows-based external client. Terraform executable Download Terraform An active Azure Stack Hub Subscription (required to create SPN if you want to use the same SPN for both Azure and Azure Stack Hub) Service Principal Name How to create Service Principal Name for Azure Stack Hub in Powershell HashiCorp documentation Azure Stack Hub Provider Website Azure Stack Hub Provider GitHub Repository How to use Terraform with Azure Stack Hub Authentication In order to authenticate with Terraform you will need to have a valid Service Principal Name (SPN) - how to create one is described in the Prerequisites . Note You only need your Service Principal Name (SPN) to be assigned to your Azure Stack Hub subscription, despite what official Terraform documentation says. The process of authentication can be handled in one of two ways, either as Environment Variables or in the Provider Block . Environment Variables Option - you can create your Terraform plan by putting only the plan itself into main.tf and then keeping variables.tf separate. You have to declare the actual values in the terraform.tfvars file. This is the file that you will need to populate with your actual credential details. Example of how variables are used in Terraform: variables.tf variable \"arm_endpoint\" {} variable \"subscription_id\" {} variable \"client_id\" {} variable \"client_secret\" {} variable \"tenant_id\" {} main.tf provider \"azurestack\" { arm_endpoint = \"${var.arm_endpoint}\" subscription_id = \"${var.subscription_id}\" client_id = \"${var.client_id}\" client_secret = \"${var.client_secret}\" tenant_id = \"${var.tenant_id}\" } terraform.tfvars # Configure the Azure Stack Hub Provider arm_endpoint = \"https://management.{region}.{domain}\" subscription_id = \"xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxx\" client_id = \"{applicationId}\" client_secret = \"{applicationSecret}\" tenant_id = \"xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxx\" Argument reference arm_endpoint - The Azure Resource Manager API Endpoint for your Azure Stack Hub instance. This will be https://management.{region}.{domain} . Note For UKCloud, the arm_endpoint is https://management.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com . subscription_id - The ID of your Azure Stack Hub Subscription. client_id - The Application GUID that you configured your Service Principal Name (SPN) to use. client_secret - The Application password that you configured your Service Principal Name (SPN) to use. tenant_id - The tenant ID of your Azure Active Directory tenant domain. It can either be the actual GUID or your Azure Active Directory tenant domain name. Note You can also put the content of variables.tf at the top of the main.tf file. Provider Block Option Provider Block Option - you can create your Terraform plan by putting everything in one main.tf file, which then contains your Provider and variables settings explicitly in said plan. Example of Provider Block: main.tf # Configure the Azure Stack Hub Provider provider \"azurestack\" { arm_endpoint = \"https://management.{region}.{domain}\" subscription_id = \"xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxx\" client_id = \"{applicationId}\" client_secret = \"{applicationPassword}\" tenant_id = \"xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxx\" } Rest of the file (...) Official Variables Guide Creating a VM The examples that follow show how to create VMs using Terraform. The code changes depending on whether you are creating a VM with an unmanaged or managed disk. You can select the type of disk you want to use, which will then update the examples below with the appropriate code. Declare variables Variable Name Variable Description Input arm_endpoint The Azure Resource Manager API endpoint for your Azure Stack Hub instance. This will be https://management.{region}.{domain}. </form> subscription_id The ID of your Azure Stack Hub subscription. </form> client_id The application GUID that you configured your Service Principal Name (SPN) to use. </form> client_secret The application password that you have configured your Service Principal Name (SPN) to use. </form> rg_name The name of the resource group you want to create </form> tenant_id The tenant ID of your Azure Active Directory tenant domain.

From a PowerShell prompt, navigate to the directory that contains your tf files (including your variable files) and run the following commands: # Check if your environment is setup correctly .\\terraform.exe init Initializing provider plugins... The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration, so the latest version was installed. To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking changes, it is recommended to add version = \"...\" constraints to the corresponding provider blocks in configuration, with the constraint strings suggested below. * provider.azurestack: version = \"~> 0.8\" * provider.random: version = \"~> 2.1\" Terraform has been successfully initialized! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"Terraform plan\" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary. # Verify your plan .\\terraform.exe plan -var-file=C:\\<DirectoryName>\\terraform.tfvars # Apply your plan .\\terraform.exe apply -var-file=C:\\<DirectoryName>\\terraform.tfvars Note You can also add -auto-approve to the apply command for it to not ask you to apply changes for full automation.

    "title": "How to deploy and configure the Azure Stack Hub Development Kit",
    "keywords": "How to deploy and configure the Azure Stack Hub Development Kit The Azure Stack Hub Development Kit (ASDK) is a single server instance of Azure Stack Hub. It is not fit for production workloads and has some subtle differences vs the real Azure Stack Hub integrate appliance, however for most test scenarios it will suffice. The ASDK is used in two modes within UKCloud: Physical hardware (pre-production) - Community support with Microsoft. Virtual servers (development and testing) - Not officially supported by Microsoft. Step 1 - Hardware pre-requisites Detailed specifications can be found here Device Details CPU >=16 cores RAM >=192GB OS Disks >=200GB Data Disks >=4 * >=240G NIC >= Windows Server 2012 R2 Certification. No specialized features required. HW logo certification >= Certified for Windows Server 2012 R2 . Virtual Deployment Physical Deployment VMware HW version must be >=11, and CPU virtual extension pass-through must be enabled. Important If you deploy your VM with Hardware Version 11 and Operating System Family as Windows Server 2016 you will not be able to create S2D Cluster as disk UUIDs are not exposed. Either create it with Windows Server 2012 and change it later. Or in Configuration Parameters, click Add Row. In the Name column, enter disk.EnableUUID. In the Value column, enter TRUE. This will show correct disk IDs in Get-PhysicalDisk cmdlets and the cluster should build. The first two drives must be setup in a RAID 1 configuration, with the rest passed through as JBoD (Just a Bunch Of Disks). Additionally, you need to specify your VLAN as ACCESS in the CIMC. Step 2 - Install base operating system Install Windows Server 2016 to the OS disk implementing a static IP address. Virtual Deployment Physical Deployment VMware tools must be installed and the VMware Tools drivers must be exported onto the C: drive (VMwareKB). Additionally, the disks have to be online and initialised as MBR. On the RAID 1 disk, the following drivers must be downloaded, extracted and installed: https://software.cisco.com/download/release.html?mdfid=286281356&softwareid=283291009&os=Windows%202016%2064-bit&release=3.0(3a)&relind=AVAILABLE&rellifecycle=&reltype=latest Step 3 - Initial setup Download the appliance and prep the virtual disk (VHDX) for the ASDK. Implement the following steps from the Microsoft documentation: Download and extract the development kit Prepare the development kit host The following details should be used: Option Parameter NTP 46.227.200.76 DNS Forwarder 8.8.8.8 Drivers Browse to path of either the extracted Cisco drivers or the extracted VMware tools Computer Name Anything but \"azurestack\", for example, \"azurestackhost\" Static IP IP details assigned to the current interface Virtual Deployment Physical Deployment Before running the installer, open C:\\AzureStack\\_Installer\\asdk-installer.ps1 and edit as follows: Line Number Current Code Updated code 1917 elseif ((get-disk | Where-Object {$_.isboot -eq $true}).Model -match 'Virtual Disk') { elseif ((get-disk | Where-Object -FilterScript { $_.isboot -eq $true }).Model -match 'null') { To edit, run: $GetScript = Get-Content -Path \"C:\\AzureStack_Installer\\asdk-installer.ps1\" $GetScript = $GetScript | ForEach-Object { ($_ -replace \"elseif \\(\\(get-disk \\| Where-Object \\`{\\`$`_.isboot -eq \\`$true\\`}\\).Model -match 'Virtual Disk'\\) \\`{\", \"elseif ((get-disk | Where-Object -FilterScript { `$====_.isboot -eq `$true }).Model -match 'null') {\") -replace \"====\",\"\" } $GetScript | Set-Content -Path \"C:\\AzureStack_Installer\\asdk-installer.ps1\" -Force To verify, run: Select-String -Path \"C:\\AzureStack_Installer\\asdk-installer.ps1\" -Pattern \"elseif \\(\\(get-disk \\| Where-Object -FilterScript \\`{ \\`$`_.isboot -eq \\`$true \\`}\\).Model -match 'null'\\) \\`{\" No additional steps. Once step 3 is complete the box will have been rebooted from the VHDX downloaded above. Step 4 - Install ASDK Implement the following steps from the Microsoft documentation: Deploy the development kit The following details should be used: Option Parameter NTP 46.227.200.76 DNS Forwarder 8.8.8.8 Type Azure AD - this should be either your own AAD account where you are the system admin or one you have setup for Azure Stack Hub, for example, contoso.onmicrosoft.com Static IP Different IP than what you currently have, for example, if your current IP is 10.0.0.101 then you could use 10.0.0.191. Virtual Deployment Physical Deployment Note If the installer cannot see any network adapters - you can manually install VMware Tools and reboot the box. After completing the wizard BUT before clicking deploy, copy the command as the install will fail. E:\\AzureStack_Installer\\asdk-installer.ps1 Initialize environment. Please wait... This will just end with nothing after exiting the installer wizard. Then you need to run the copied InstallAzureStackPOC.ps1 command to create the Roles directory, which will contain the below script. Open C:\\CloudDeployment\\Roles\\PhysicalMachines\\Tests\\BareMetal.Tests.ps1 and edit as follows: Line Number Current code Updated code Reference 780 PartNumber = $_.PartNumber.Trim(); PartNumber = $_.PartNumber; https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/f9060fe2-4408-41a4-b387-09a3e9a09f00/ltstacktracegtat-line-762-in?forum=AzureStack 1202 ($physicalMachine.Processors.NumberOfEnabledCores | Measure-Object -Sum).Sum | Should Not BeLessThan $minimumNumberOfCoresPerMachine ($physicalMachine.Processors.NumberOfEnabledCores | Measure-Object -Sum).Sum | Should Not BeLessThan 0 To edit, run: $GetScript = Get-Content -Path \"C:\\CloudDeployment\\Roles\\PhysicalMachines\\Tests\\BareMetal.Tests.ps1\" $GetScript = $GetScript | ForEach-Object { $_ -replace \"$_.PartNumber.Trim\\(\\);\", \"$_.PartNumber;\" } $GetScript = $GetScript | ForEach-Object { $_ -replace \"\\(\\`$physicalMachine.Processors.NumberOfEnabledCores \\| Measure-Object -Sum\\).Sum \\| Should Not BeLessThan \\`$minimumNumberOfCoresPerMachine\", \"(`$physicalMachine.Processors.NumberOfEnabledCores | Measure-Object -Sum).Sum | Should Not BeLessThan 0\" } $GetScript | Set-Content -Path \"C:\\CloudDeployment\\Roles\\PhysicalMachines\\Tests\\BareMetal.Tests.ps1\" -Force To verify, run: Select-String -Path \"C:\\CloudDeployment\\Roles\\PhysicalMachines\\Tests\\BareMetal.Tests.ps1\" -Pattern \"PartNumber = \\`$_.PartNumber;\" Select-String -Path \"C:\\CloudDeployment\\Roles\\PhysicalMachines\\Tests\\BareMetal.Tests.ps1\" -Pattern \"\\(\\`$physicalMachine.Processors.NumberOfEnabledCores \\| Measure-Object -Sum\\).Sum \\| Should Not BeLessThan 0\" After you've modified it, run: $AdminPass = ConvertTo-SecureString -String 'Password123'-AsPlainText -Force $Username = \"azurestackadmin@<domain>.onmicrosoft.com\" $Password = \"<password>\" $Password = ConvertTo-SecureString -String $Password -AsPlainText -Force $Credentials = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList $Username, $Password cd C:\\CloudDeployment\\Setup .\\InstallAzureStackPOC.ps1 -AdminPassword $AdminPass -InfraAzureDirectoryTenantAdminCredential $credentialsS -InfraAzureDirectoryTenantName <domain>.onmicrosoft.com -DNSForwarder 8.8.8.8 -TimeServer 46.227.200.76 Note Before running the installation, make sure only one network adapter is enabled, otherwise the install will fail. For some reason the driver injection does not work and you have to manually add Ethernet Adapters from Device Manager, then disable everything but management-0. Configure its IP address and then run the install. Example of Automated Physical Kit Deployment: $AdminPass = ConvertTo-SecureString -String 'Password123' -AsPlainText -Force $Username = \"azurestackadmin@<domain>.onmicrosoft.com\" $Password = \"<password>\" $Password = ConvertTo-SecureString -String $Password -AsPlainText -Force $Credentials = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList $Username, $Password cd C:\\CloudDeployment\\Setup .\\InstallAzureStackPOC.ps1 -AdminPassword $AdminPass -InfraAzureDirectoryTenantAdminCredential $Credentials -InfraAzureDirectoryTenantName <domain>.onmicrosoft.com -DNSForwarder 8.8.8.8 -TimeServer 46.227.200.76 Important Do not set the InfraAzureDirectoryTenantAdminCredential parameter if the AAD account has MFA enabled as you will not be able to authenticate correctly. Instead, leave it blank and you will be prompted for the AAD account a few minutes after you run the script. Fix for Potential Installation Failure 1803 install failed with the below error: Invoke-EceAction : Type 'Deployment' of Role 'Domain' raised an exception: 'AzS-DC01' failed to start. Virtual machine 'AzS-DC01' could not be started because the hypervisor is not running. 'AzS-DC01' failed to start. (Virtual machine ID DA2A3A2D-F30B-42C3-AB39-C4BF11E07CEE) Virtual machine 'AzS-DC01' could not be started because the hypervisor is not running (Virtual machine ID DA2A3A2D-F30B-42C3-AB39-C4BF11E07CEE). The following actions may help you resolve the problem: 1) Verify that the processor of the physical computer has a supported version of hardware-assisted virtualization. 2) Verify that hardware-assisted virtualization and hardware-assisted data execution protection are enabled in the BIOS of the physical computer. (If you edit the BIOS to enable either setting, you must turn off the power to the physical computer and then turn it back on. Resetting the physical computer is not sufficient.) 3) If you have made changes to the Boot Configuration Data store, review these changes to ensure that the hypervisor is configured to launch automatically. at New-ManagementVM, C:\\Program Files\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules\\NewManagementVM\\NewManagementVM.psm1: line 493 at DeployOneVM, C:\\CloudDeployment\\Classes\\Common\\Image\\VirtualMachineRole.psm1: line 1321 at DeployVms, C:\\CloudDeployment\\Classes\\Common\\Image\\VirtualMachineRole.psm1: line 1501 at Deployment, C:\\CloudDeployment\\Classes\\Common\\Image\\VirtualMachineRole.psm1: line 1600 at <ScriptBlock>, <No file>: line 39 at <ScriptBlock>, <No file>: line 37 At C:\\CloudDeployment\\Setup\\DeploySingleNode.ps1:676 char:5 + Invoke-EceAction -RolePath $masterRole -ActionType $actionPlan @d ... + ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ + CategoryInfo : NotSpecified: (:) [Invoke-EceAction], InterfaceInvocationFailedException + FullyQualifiedErrorId : OperationFailed,Microsoft.HyperV.PowerShell.Commands.StartVM,CloudEngine.Cmdlets.InvokeCmdlet Invoke-EceAction : Action: Invocation of step PhysicalMachineAndInitialConfiguration.15 failed.

To verify, you can run systeminfo and it will show whether the BIOS is set correctly, and so on. In our case it was set correctly, only the boot settings were not. To fix it, run the below from an elevated command prompt: BCDEDIT /Set {current} hypervisorlaunchtype auto Then reboot the box and continue the install. Post-Deployment Troubleshooting Service Principal creation failed during registration process When registering the ASDK, you may experience a timeout during the Service Principal creation. If you inspect the action plan you will see that this is actually caused by an issue with connecting to the below addresses, which are the client and admin portals. TCP connection failed for the following VIPs: 'SDRInternal' 192.168.105.8:19007 'SDRInternal' 192.168.105.8:19000. A potential fix is to try increasing the memory and disk space of the 'AzS' virtual machines in Hyper-V manager. As a general guide, make sure that you assign enough memory to meet the Memory Demand listed in the Memory tab for each virtual machine. After making any changes, you should restart the ASDK as follows: # Create your Credentials $AzsUsername = \"AzureStack\\CloudAdmin\" $AzsPassword = 'Password123!' $AzsUserPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString -String $AzsPassword -AsPlainText -Force $AzsCred = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList $AzsUsername, $AzsUserPassword $Session = New-PSSession -ComputerName AzS-ERCS01 -Credential $AzsCred -ConfigurationName PrivilegedEndpoint -SessionOption (New-PSSessionOption -Culture en-US -UICulture en-US) Enter-PSSession $Session # This will shutdown the machine after a few minutes. You will need to manually start the VM again once it is shutdown (e.g. through VMWare vCloud Director) Stop-AzureStack # When the machine is back up, create the PSSession again and run the below command to retrieve the status of Start-AzureStack Get-ActionStatus Start-AzureStack If the above does not resolve the issue, then you will likely need to redeploy the ASDK from the beginning.

    "keywords": "How to deploy an SQL template to Azure Stack Hub using PowerShell This article explains how to deploy an SQL Always On Cluster using an ARM Template to Azure Stack Hub using PowerShell. It will guide you through the process of: Obtaining an ARM Template Deploying an ARM Template for SQL Always On What is an ARM Template? You can use Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates to deploy and provision all the resources for your application in a single, coordinated operation. You can also redeploy templates to make changes to the resources in a resource group. These templates can be deployed via the Azure Stack Hub portal, PowerShell, Azure CLI, REST API and Visual Studio. The following quick-start templates are available on GitHub . Prerequisites Prerequisites from a Windows-based external client are: PowerShell 5.1 and AzureStack PowerShell Module: Configure PowerShell Environment and Azure Stack Hub Module An active Azure Stack Hub subscription An Azure Stack Hub Service Principal Name (SPN) Microsoft documentation Azure Stack Hub ARM Templates Overview Deploy a template to Azure Stack Hub using PowerShell Understand the structure and syntax of Azure Resource Manager Templates GitHub Template Repository Download SQL Always On template from GitHub SQL Always On Repository - sql-2016-alwayson Note This will download just the sql-2016-alwayson folder from the repository instead of downloading all of it. Change $Env:USERPROFILE\\sql-2016-alwayson below to the desired folder. From an elevated (run as administrator) PowerShell prompt run: mkdir $Env:USERPROFILE\\sql-2016-alwayson cd $Env:USERPROFILE\\sql-2016-alwayson git init git config core.sparseCheckout true git remote add origin -f \"https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-QuickStart-Templates\" \"sql-2016-alwayson*\" | Out-File -FilePath .git/info/sparse-checkout -Encoding ASCII cat .git/info/sparse-checkout git checkout master What does it deploy? This template deploys two SQL Server 2016 SP1 or SP2 Enterprise / Standard / Developer instances in the Always On Availability Group using the PowerShell DSC extension. It creates the following resources: A network security group. A virtual network. Four storage accounts (One for AD, one for SQL, one for file share witness and one for VM diagnostics). Four public IP address (One for AD, one for each SQL VM and one for a public LB bound to SQL always on listener). One external load balancer for SQL VMs with a public IP bound to the SQL always on listener. One VM (WS2016) configured as a domain controller for a new forest with a single domain. Two VMs (WS2016) configured as SQL Server 2016 SP1 or SP2 Enterprise/Standard/Developer. One VM (WS2016) configured as a file share witness for the cluster. Two availability sets, one containing the SQL and FSW 2016 VMs, the other containing the domain controller VM. Notes The images used to create this deployment are: Active Directory (AD) and File Share Witness (FSW) - Windows Server 2016 Datacenter image. SQL Server - SQL Server 2016 SP1 or SP2 on Windows Server 2016 image (Enterprise, Standard or Developer). SQL IAAS Extension 1.2.30. Latest DSC Extension (2.76.0 or higher). Latest custom script extension for Windows (1.9.1, or higher). Warning If you deploy SQL STANDARD, your Availability Group will have limitations as per Basic Availability Groups : Basic Availability Group Limitations Basic availability groups use a subset of features compared to those normally found in advanced availability groups on SQL Server 2016 Enterprise Edition. Basic availability groups include the following limitations: Limit of two replicas (primary and secondary). No read access on secondary replica. No backups on secondary replica. No integrity checks on secondary replicas. No support for replicas hosted on servers running a version of SQL Server prior to SQL Server > 2016 Community Technology Preview 3 (CTP3). Support for one availability database. Basic availability groups cannot be upgraded to advanced availability groups. The group must be dropped and re-added to a group that contains servers running only SQL Server 2016 Enterprise Edition. Basic availability groups are only supported for Standard Edition servers. Basic availability groups can not be part of a distributed availability group. Configuration Each SQL VM will have the number and size of data disks specified, of up to 1TiB each. The SQL extension will configure these into a single volume using storage spaces. The template configures the SQL instances with contained database authentication set to true . The SQL VMs and the file share witness will be configured in an availability set: Integrated systems (fault domains:3, update domains:5) The DNS suffix for public IP addresses.

    "keywords": "How to manage Azure user groups and permissions Overview UKCloud for Microsoft Azure provides you with three default user groups to get you started: AzureStackOperators - Members of this group have Owner permissions and have full access to all resources and can manage access to resources AzureStackUsers - Members of this group have Contributor permissions and can create and manage all resources but cannot manage access to resources AzureStackReadOnly - Members of this group have Reader permissions and can view everything but cannot make changes If these default groups do not meet your requirements, for example, if you've created a custom role and want to grant users the permissions specified by that role, you can create new groups and assign roles and permissions to them. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have global administrator access to the Azure portal and Owner access to the UKCloud Azure Stack Hub portal. Creating a group for Azure users Rather than granting permissions to individual users, we recommend that you first create a group and add your Azure users to that group. To create a group in the Azure portal: Log in to the public Azure portal as a global administrator. For help with identifying your Azure global administrators, see here Navigate to the Azure Active Directory . Tip You can find the Azure Active Directory by selecting All services and scrolling down to the Security + Identity section. Select Groups . Click the New group option. From the Group type list, select Security . In the Group name field, enter a name for the group, for example, AzureStackGroup . In the Group description field, enter a brief, but meaningful description for the group. There are two possible options for the Membership type field: Assigned or Dynamic . Note The Dynamic option requires at least a Premium P1 license in Azure AD. If you do not meet this requirement, the dropdown is automatically set to Assigned and you will not be able to select the Dynamic option. Click Create . To add users to the group, open the group, select Members then click Add members . Granting Azure permissions After setting up the user group in Azure, you need to go to the UKCloud Azure Stack Hub portal to grant the appropriate permissions to the group. To grant Azure permissions to a group: Log in to the UKCloud Azure Stack Hub portal . Navigate to Subscriptions . Tip If you can't see Subscriptions in your favourites panel, click All services and then Subscriptions . You can add Subscriptions to your favourites panel by clicking the star icon.

    "keywords": "How to use the Azure Stack Hub API Overview The Azure Stack Hub API enables you to interact programmatically with your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure environment. For example, you can use API calls to manage your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure tenancy. This article shows you how to get started with the Azure Stack Hub API. When interacting with Azure Stack Hub resources via the API, you must specify an API version. You can find a full list of supported API versions here . Prerequisites To complete the steps in this article, you must have appropriate access to a subscription on Azure Stack Hub and permissions on the resources you are trying to access. Authenticating to the API Azure Stack Hub API authentication uses access tokens to validate requests. To obtain an access token: Send a POST request to the Azure REST authentication/login endpoint: https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant_id>/oauth2/token where tenant_id is one of the following: Your tenant domain, for example: ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com , ukcloud.com , example.mydomain.com Your tenant ID, for example: 8eaef023-2b34-4da1-9baa-8bc8c9d6a490 The default value for tenant independent keys: common Pass the following parameters in the request body: grant_type - The type of authentication scheme to use: password client_id - Hard-coded to a default value of 1950a258-227b-4e31-a9cf-717495945fc2 Other options for specific scenarios are: PowerShell - 1950a258-227b-4e31-a9cf-717495945fc2 LegacyPowerShell - 0a7bdc5c-7b57-40be-9939-d4c5fc7cd417* WindowsAzureActiveDirectory - 00000002-0000-0000-c000-000000000000 VisualStudio - 872cd9fa-d31f-45e0-9eab-6e460a02d1f1 AzureCLI - 04b07795-8ddb-461a-bbee-02f9e1bf7b46 resource - The endpoint of the resource that the token will be used to access, for example: https://management.as2ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com/90ada28c-5aed-4248-90c7-0538504217f1 Note You can obtain the resource endpoint by querying the Azure Stack Hub management metadata endpoint. The resource endpoint is returned in the audiences section of the response. It is constructed like this: https://management.<region>.<AzureStackHubFQDN>/metadata/endpoints?api-version=2017-12-01 For example, to find the endpoint for the users resource, send a request to https://management.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com/metadata/endpoints?api-version=2017-12-01 . Tip For Azure Stack Hub administrators ( operators ) add admin to the request. For example, to find the endpoint for the operators resource, send a request to https://adminmanagement.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com/metadata/endpoints?api-version=2017-12-01 . username - The Azure Stack Hub AAD account, for example: user@contoso.onmicrosoft.com password - The password for the Azure Stack Hub AAD account Note Ensure you format the request body using Content-Type x-www-form-urlencoded . Declare variables Enter details below to provide values for the variables in the scripts in this article: Variable name Variable description Input $Tenant The tenant ID or domain to authenticate to </form> $AzureStackUsername The username of a user for Azure Stack Hub </form> $AzureStackUserPassword The password of a user for Azure Stack Hub </form> $ClientID The application ID to authenticate against the Azure Stack Hub API </form> Windows Linux PowerShell 5.1, PowerShell 7, or Command Line PowerShell 7 or Bash PowerShell Command Line Bash # Declare variables $Tenant = \" contoso.onmicrosoft.com \" $UserName = \" user@contoso.onmicrosoft.com \" $UserPassword = \" Password123! \" $AuthRequestBody = @{ \"grant_type\" = \"password\" \"client_id\" = \" 1950a258-227b-4e31-a9cf-717495945fc2 \" \"resource\" = \"https://management.as2ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com/90ada28c-5aed-4248-90c7-0538504217f1\" \"username\" = $UserName \"password\" = $UserPassword } # Send POST request to Azure REST authentication/login endpoint to retrieve access token. $AuthResp = Invoke-RestMethod -Method \"POST\" -Uri \"https://login.microsoftonline.com/$Tenant/oauth2/token\" -Body $AuthRequestBody -ContentType \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" $AuthResp # Send POST request to Azure REST authentication/login endpoint to retrieve access token. curl -X \"POST\" \"https://login.microsoftonline.com/ contoso.onmicrosoft.com /oauth2/token\" ^ -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" ^ --data-urlencode \"client_id= 1950a258-227b-4e31-a9cf-717495945fc2 \" ^ --data-urlencode \"grant_type=password\" ^ --data-urlencode \"username= user@contoso.onmicrosoft.com \" ^ --data-urlencode \"password= Password123! \" ^ --data-urlencode \"resource=https://management.as2ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com/90ada28c-5aed-4248-90c7-0538504217f1\" # Send POST request to Azure REST authentication/login endpoint to retrieve access token. curl -X \"POST\" \"https://login.microsoftonline.com/ contoso.onmicrosoft.com /oauth2/token\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\ --data-urlencode \"client_id= 1950a258-227b-4e31-a9cf-717495945fc2 \" \\ --data-urlencode \"grant_type=password\" \\ --data-urlencode \"username= user@contoso.onmicrosoft.com \" \\ --data-urlencode \"password= Password123! \" \\ --data-urlencode \"resource=https://management.as2ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com/90ada28c-5aed-4248-90c7-0538504217f1\" If the authentication is successful, the endpoint returns an access token, for example: { \"token_type\": \"Bearer\", \"scope\": \"user_impersonation\", \"expires_in\": \"3599\", \"ext_expires_in\": \"0\", \"expires_on\": \"1512574780\", \"not_before\": \"1512570880\", \"resource\": \"https://management.as2ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com/90ada28c-5aed-4248-90c7-0538504217f1\", \"access_token\": \"eyJ0eXAiOi...truncated for readability...\", \"refresh_token\": \"AQABAAAAAA...truncated for readability...\" } You must include this token in the Authorization header of each subsequent API request, for example: PowerShell Command Line Bash # Add access token to header object for subsequent API requests $AuthHeader = @{\"Authorization\" = \"Bearer $($AuthResp.access_token)\"} # Query the Azure Stack Hub API for subscriptions Invoke-RestMethod -Method \"GET\" -Uri \"https://management.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com/subscriptions\" -Headers $AuthHeader -Body @{\"api-version\" = \"2017-12-01\"} -ContentType \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOi...truncated for readability...\" 'https://management.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com/subscriptions?api-version=2017-12-01' curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOi...truncated for readability...\" 'https://management.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com/subscriptions?api-version=2017-12-01' Calling Azure Stack Hub API endpoints A REST request URI consists of: <URI-scheme>://<URI-host>/<resource-path>?<query-string> where: URI-scheme is the protocol used to transmit the request, for example http or https URI-host is the domain name or IP address of the server where the REST service endpoint is hosted, for example: management.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com resource path is the resource or resource collection used by the service in determining the selection of those resources (the path may include multiple segments), for example: /subscriptions is the resource path to obtain information about Azure Stack Hub subscriptions query-string provides additional parameters, such as the API version or resource selection criteria Note For Bash, you can add the query-string to the end of the request URI following a question mark. For example, to specify use of a specific API version: https://management.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com/subscriptions?api-version=2017-12-01 . For PowerShell, you can provide a query-string in the -Body parameter hash table. For example: -Body @{\"api-version\" = \"2017-12-01\"} The syntax of an Azure Stack Hub request URI is: https://management.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/<provider>/<resource-path>?<filter-expression>&api-version=<api-version> where: subscription-id is your tenant subscription ID resource-group is the resource group you want to query provider is the provider you want to query resource-path is the resource you want to query filter-expression is an optional list of arguments to filter the results of the query api-version is the version of the Azure Stack Hub API being called, for example: api-version=2017-12-01 For example, the following API call returns the VM: Windows-VM located in the resource group: MY-WINDOWS-VM-RG in the specified Azure Stack Hub subscription: https://management.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com/subscriptions/800c4168-3eb1-405b-a4ca-919fe7ee42e9/resourceGroups/MY-WINDOWS-VM-RG/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/Windows-VM?api-version=2017-12-01 Tip To query a top level API resource, such as virtual machines, use the following example: https://management.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com/subscriptions/800c4168-3eb1-405b-a4ca-919fe7ee42e9/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines?api-version=2017-12-01 Next steps For general information about the Azure API, see the Azure REST API Reference at: Azure API documentation page In particular, you may find the following documents useful: Azure Stack Hub REST API AD protocols oauth AD auth scenarios AD V2 protocol oauth Azure Stack Hub resource provider API This is guidance for Azure Stack Hub users.

    "title": "Understanding UKCloud for Microsoft Azure",
    "keywords": "Understanding UKCloud for Microsoft Azure Introduction UKCloud for Microsoft Azure provides you with new options to harness Microsoft Azure alongside other cloud platforms, including Oracle, VMware and OpenStack. This gives you the flexibility to accommodate diverse workloads within a low latency, accredited platform with native connectivity to non-cloud workloads in Crown Hosting and the networks that are vital to the public sector: from PSN to HSCN and RLI. This article provides an introduction to UKCloud for Microsoft Azure and helps you get up and running. Supported features UKCloud for Microsoft Azure supports the following Azure Stack Hub IaaS features: Compute Virtual machines (VMs) provide the basic building block providing compute in Azure Stack Hub. For a list of available VM sizes, see: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-vm-sizes . You can deploy VMs using the UKCloud Azure Stack Hub portal and other tooling. VMs have the following support: Azure Compute APIs - Provides you with programmatic access to virtual machines and their supporting resources. For further information, see the Azure REST API Reference . Azure Stack Hub Marketplace - Provides access to pre-created images that help speed up application delivery. Azure Resource Manager - Enables you to write templates to deploy, update and delete Azure Stack Hub resources in a single co-ordinated operation. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-vm-considerations Network Virtual networks - Azure Stack Hub enables you to configure virtual private clouds, create and manage your private address space within Azure; you can configure this via the UI, API and other tooling. Load balancers (IPv4 only) — You can deploy basic load balancers. VPN gateway — You can use the Azure Stack Hub VPN gateway to create site-to-site VPNs to remote infrastructure. Routing — You can configure basic custom defined routing on virtual networks; Vnet to Vnet peering is not yet supported. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-network-differences Storage Type of storage Description Notes vs public Azure Azure Blob Storage (block) Object storage; good for storing documents, videos, images and so on. Maximum block blob size is 4.75 TB (100 MB x 50,000 blocks) for the 1802 update or newer version. Previous versions are limited to 50,000 x 4 MB (approximately 195 GB). Blob name size differs slightly at 880 characters (1,760 bytes), compared to 1,024 characters (2,048 bytes) for public Azure. Azure Blob Storage (page) Used to support virtual machine disks; good for randomly accessed large files. Maximum page blob size differs greatly at 1TB for Azure Stack Hub, compared to 8TB for public Azure. Azure Blob Storage (append) Used for log files. Azure Queue Storage Message queue as a service to provide asynchronous scale out micro-services, among other things. Azure Table Storage NoSQL database service; good for highly scalable, eventually consistent database support. Maximum table partition key and row key size is 400 characters (800 bytes), compared to 1,024 characters (2,048 bytes) for public Azure. Advanced features Key Vault — Azure Stack Hub provides cryptographic secret storage for applications and services. These services can be consumed via both portal and API. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-kv-intro Design considerations When designing your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure applications, consider the following: Compute Azure Stack Hub supports a subset of Azure VM extensions; UKCloud for Microsoft Azure currently supports the following: Microsoft.OSTCExtensions v1.5.2 CustomScriptForLinux v1.5.5, v1.5.2.2 & v1.5.2.0 VMAccessForLinux v1.5.2 & v1.4.0.0 OSPatchingForLinux v2.3.0.1 DependencyAgentLinux v9.10.6.11730 DependencyAgentWindows v9.10.6.11730 OmsAgentForLinux v1.13.27 & v1.8.11 MicrosoftMonitoringAgent v1.0.11081.5 & v1.0.10900.0 SqlIaaSAgent v1.3.20370 BGInfo v2.1 CustomScriptExtension v1.9.3 & v1.8 JsonADDomainExtension v1.3.4, v1.3.2 & v1.3 VMAccessAgent v2.4.4 & v2.0 DockerExtension v1.1.1606092330 CustomScript v2.0.6 DSC v2.77.0.0 & v2.19.0.0 IaaSAntimalware v1.5.5.9 & v1.4.0.0 IaaSDiagnostics v1.12.2.2 & v1.10.1.1 LinuxDiagnostic v3.0.121 AmdGpuDriverWindows v1.0.4.0 & v1.0.1.0 NvidiaGpuDriverLinux v1.3.0.0 NvidiaGpuDriverWindows v1.3.1.0 For an up-to-date list of the supported extensions, perform the following steps: First, ensure that you've installed the relevant Azure PowerShell modules from the following link: Configure the Azure Stack Hub user's PowerShell environment Then run the following commands: Add-AzEnvironment -Name \"AzureStackUser\" -ArmEndpoint \"https://management.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com\" Connect-AzAccount -EnvironmentName \"AzureStackUser\" Get-AzVMImagePublisher -Location \"frn00006\" | Get-AzVMExtensionImageType | Get-AzVMExtensionImage | ` Select-Object -Property Type, Version | Format-Table -AutoSize Use load balancers to make the best use of IP address quota. Azure Stack Hub API may be a couple of releases behind public Azure API. Single region and single state set (affects availability). VM sets don't support auto-scale, so consider how to handle load. Check Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates to see if they're compatible with Azure Stack Hub. Storage Azure Stack Hub storage is all served from the same pool of disks and does not provide \"limitless\" storage, so you should consider the following: Use blob storage (object storage) to support the application; not for multiple petabytes of data storage. Put large volume data on UKCloud's Cloud Storage . Clean up backups to conserve storage. Consider use of temporary storage. For some blob types, there is a difference in maximum storage between public Azure and Azure Stack Hub. No guarantees around IOPS. Use blob storage for queues to help deliver scalable micro-services. Accessing UKCloud for Microsoft Azure You can access UKCloud for Microsoft Azure from the following location: https://portal.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com/ Further information For more information about Azure Stack Hub, see the following Microsoft resources: Azure Stack Hub User Documentation For more information about UKCloud for Microsoft Azure, see: Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for Microsoft Azure UKCloud for Microsoft Azure FAQs Configure the Azure Stack Hub user's PowerShell environment Related videos UKCloud Azure Stack Hub portal overview video Related repositories UKCloud Azure Stack Hub Repository Feedback If you find a problem with this article, click Improve this Doc to make the change yourself or raise an issue in GitHub.

    "title": "Pricing information for UKCloud for Microsoft Azure",
    "keywords": "Pricing information for UKCloud for Microsoft Azure Overview UKCloud for Microsoft Azure VM pricing can be as low as 3p per hour. Full pricing with all options, including public Azure, licensing and connectivity, is available in the UKCloud Pricing Guide . UKCloud for Microsoft Azure pricing is simple; you only pay for the vCPU and memory you use and any additional storage consumed. Public Azure As a Microsoft Certified Service Provider (CSP), UKCloud can facilitate the sale of Microsoft Azure products and services to customers who are purchasing Azure as part of a broader solution supported by UKCloud's Professional Services, our Managed Services capabilities or as part of a multi-cloud solution in combination with one of our other cloud technologies. UKCloud passes the Azure components at Microsoft list price. This enables you to benefit from consolidated billing and UKCloud's award-winning customer services relationships, including our Service Delivery Managers and Cloud Architects. For the latest Public Azure prices, see https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/pricing/ . Licensing Through the Azure Marketplace, you can select the Microsoft licensing that you require, and you'll be invoiced at the end of each month for your exact usage. UKCloud offers Azure on a multi-tenant basis and, according to Microsoft Azure licensing guidelines , the Azure Hybrid Use Benefit (AHUB) option is not applicable for Windows Server operating systems. This means that you'll be unable to bring your own on-premises operating system licensing. With regards to Microsoft SQL Server, you can either bring your own SQL Server licensing (you must have valid Software Assurance) and utilise License Mobility, or choose for UKCloud to invoice you based on your exact usage under our SPLA contract. Red Hat (once certified by Microsoft) is available via the BYOL process, or we can invoice you based on your exact usage. Pricing example Security domain: Assured OFFICIAL Machine type: A-Series Machine size: 2 vCPU, 4GiB RAM Additional storage used: 100GiB Operating system: Microsoft Windows Server VM cost per month An A-Series VM in the Assured OFFICIAL security domain costs £0.03 per vCPU per hour and £0.013 per GiB RAM per hour. Microsoft Windows Server OS licensing costs £0.035 per vCPU per hour. So, an A-Series VM with 2 vCPU and 4GiB RAM costs (2 x £0.03) + (4 x £0.013) + (2 x £0.035) = £0.06 + £0.052 + £0.07 = £0.182 per hour. In an average 730 hour month, the monthly VM cost works out at 730 x £0.182 = £132.86 . Storage cost per month Additional storage costs £0.10 per GiB per month. 100GiB of additional storage costs £10.00 per month. Total basic cost Calculate the total basic cost by adding together the monthly VM and storage costs. VM cost per month + Storage cost per month = Total basic cost £132.86 + £10.00 = £142.86 Discount options The following discount and purchase schemes are available with UKCloud for Microsoft Azure: Commitment discount Annual subscription discount Cloud Credits For more information about the discount and purchase schemes offered by UKCloud, see the UKCloud Pricing Guide . Additional pricing notes SQL Standard is charged per hour based on the powered-on state of the host VM. SQL Enterprise is charged monthly. You must report, via support ticket, which VMs have either SQL Standard or Enterprise installed so that we can license and bill you accordingly. You do have the option to bring your own licences for SQL under Microsoft Mobility, though you must inform us as soon as you receive confirmation from Microsoft that mobility has been agreed. For more information, see How to license Microsoft applications/software on the UKCloud platform . Microsoft Windows Server licences must be provided by UKCloud and you'll be billed per hour based on the powered-on state of the host VM. If you want to host Oracle solutions on our platform, consult our Cloud Architects, or consider our Dedicated Compute v2 or Private Cloud for Oracle Software services to avoid licensing issues. Billing and payment information Billing for the service is one month in arrears. For infrastructure solutions, you'll be billed by the smallest unit of time, which is one hour for compute and one month per GiB for storage. Payment can be made by direct bank transfer. You can find bank details for payment on your invoice. Termination fees There are no termination fees for the service. You are responsible for extracting your own data from the platform if required. UKCloud may make an additional charge for transferring data out of the service.

    "keywords": "UKCloud for Microsoft Azure Service Scope About this document This document describes the boundaries of the UKCloud for Microsoft Azure service, along with the division of responsibilities between UKCloud and the customer, to facilitate the provisioning and ongoing use of the service. About UKCloud for Microsoft Azure UKCloud for Microsoft Azure harnesses the innovation of Microsoft's Azure Stack Hub platform to deliver Microsoft Azure services from UKCloud's award-winning government-grade multi-cloud environment, addressing the security, service, connectivity and diversity requirements of UK Public Sector organisations and their industry partners. As a Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider (CSP), UKCloud can also manage and support customers in their utilisation of Microsoft Azure public, making UKCloud the one-stop partner for all your Microsoft Azure requirements. Service delivery options UKCloud can deliver an Azure service using either our own Azure Stack Hub from the UKCloud platform, from the Azure public service or a combination of the two. While the functionality and tooling are very similar for both options, there are some differences, including the process of assigning agreements, billing and responsibilities. For clarity, the following are specific to each delivery option. UKCloud Azure Stack Hub This single-tenant service is provisioned from the UKCloud platform, and is owned, maintained and supported by UKCloud as with all other UKCloud technology stacks. UKCloud Azure Stack Hub Service implementation Service management API. Enables customers to programmatically interact with UKCloud for Microsoft Azure resources. UKCloud for Microsoft Azure Marketplace. Provides access to pre-created images, which help speed up application delivery. Azure Resource Manager. Enables customers to write templates to deploy, update and delete UKCloud for Microsoft Azure resources in a single coordinated operation. VM Extensions. UKCloud for Microsoft Azure supports virtual machine extensions that provide post deployment management for automation (for example, PowerShell DSC). Service options Customers can build a tailored solution to meet their requirements by mixing and matching service options. This choice enables the scaling up or down of resources to meet requirements changes, without service or size lock-in. Azure Stack Hub is available only as a private deployment (single-tenant). Customers with private Azure Stack Hub environments can consume Microsoft Azure IaaS services and services built on Azure IaaS templates like Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and also enable PaaS services such as Azure Functions, SQL and MySQL services, IoT Hub and Event Hubs. For a full list of Azure Stack Hub services, see here . IaaS compute Virtual machines (VMs) provide the basic building blocks of compute resource within UKCloud for Microsoft Azure. Each standard machine has a pre-allocated number of vCPUs, amount of memory and a temporary disk. The available sizes and families of VMs are continually increasing. Broadly, the following machine families are supported: Basic and Standard A-Series. CPU performance and memory configurations best suited for entry level workloads like development and test. Standard D-Series and DS-Series. Optimised CPU-to-memory configuration, making them suitable for most general-purpose applications. A subset of the D-series VMs also supports higher memory per CPU, making them suitable for applications that require higher amounts of memory. Basic and Standard F-Series. Optimised for CPU-intensive workloads so have a higher CPU-to-memory configurations. GPU enabled (NVIDIA and AMD) N-Series VM types as follows: NCv3, NVv4 (AMD MI25), NCasT4_v3. For a full list of supported virtual machine sizes, see here . For more information about GPU-enabled VMs, see here . Customers can deploy VMs using the UKCloud Azure Stack Hub portal and other tooling. Warning Each VM contains a temporary disk. The temporary disk provides short-term storage for applications and processes and is intended to only store data such as page or swap files. Data on the temporary disk may be lost during a maintenance event or when redeploying a VM. Storage options There are several ways to address storage requirements in UKCloud for Microsoft Azure: Azure Blob Storage (Page). Page blobs are optimised for representing IaaS disks and supporting random writes that are up to 1 TB in size. An IaaS disk attached to an Azure Stack Hub VM is a Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) stored as a page blob. Azure Blob Storage (Block). Block blobs (generically known as object storage) are optimised for streaming and storing cloud objects, and are a good choice for storing documents, media files, backups, and so on. Azure Blob Storage (Append). Append blobs are optimised for append operations. An append blob can be updated only by adding a new block to the end. Append blobs are a good choice for scenarios such as logging, where new data needs to be written only to the end of the blob. Azure Queue Storage. In designing applications for scale, application components are often decoupled, so that they can scale independently. Queue storage provides a reliable messaging solution for asynchronous communication between application components, whether they're running in the cloud, on the desktop, on an on-premises server, or on a mobile device. Queue storage also supports managing asynchronous tasks and building process workflows. A storage account can contain any number of queues, and a queue can contain any number of messages, up to the capacity limit of the storage account. Individual messages may be up to 64 KB in size. Azure Table Storage. Table storage is Microsoft's NoSQL key/attribute store - it has a schemaless design, making it different from traditional relational databases. With a schemaless data store, it's easy to adapt data as the needs of the application evolve. Table storage is easy to use, so developers can create applications quickly. Table storage is a key-attribute store, which means that every value in a table is stored with a typed property name. The property name can be used for filtering and specifying selection criteria. A collection of properties and their values comprise an entity. Since table storage is schemaless, two entities in the same table can contain different collections of properties, and those properties can be of different types. Table storage is useful for storing flexible datasets, such as user data for web applications, address books, device information and any other type of metadata that a service requires. For today's internet-based applications, NoSQL databases like table storage offer a popular alternative to traditional relational databases. A storage account can contain any number of tables, and a table can contain any number of entities, up to the capacity limit of the storage account. Note All storage in Azure Stack Hub is taken from a common pool. When designing a service for UKCloud for Microsoft Azure, developers should consider the best usage of storage. For example, for a large object storage requirement, consider using UKCloud's Cloud Storage service as part of the solution. Network UKCloud manages the physical firewalls that face public and secure networks. Customers can deploy multiple gateway devices and configure the following using either the UKCloud Azure Stack Hub portal or API: Virtual networks. UKCloud for Microsoft Azure enables customers to configure virtual private clouds and create and manage a private address space within Azure. Customers can configure this via the UI, API or other tooling. VNet peering. Enables customers to seamlessly connect virtual networks inside an Azure Stack Hub environment. Load balancers (IPv4 only). Deploy basic load balancers VPN gateway across Azure environments. VPN gateway. Use the UKCloud for Microsoft Azure VPN gateway to create site-to-site VPNs to remote infrastructure. Routing. Configure basic custom defined routing on virtual networks. Internet-facing solutions have a pool of usable public IP addresses. Contact your Service Delivery Manager (SDM) regarding any additional requirements. Advanced features Key Vault. UKCloud for Microsoft Azure provides cryptographic secret storage for applications and services. Customers can consume these services via both portal and API. For more information, see here . Protection options Customers are responsible for designing their own disaster recovery and backup solutions as part of their adoption of UKCloud for Microsoft Azure. Azure Stack Hub Marketplace UKCloud for Microsoft Azure includes access to a local version of the Azure Marketplace. The Marketplace contains a collection of services, applications and resources customised for Azure Stack Hub that customers can deploy in their environment. Every Marketplace item has: An Azure Resource Manager template for resource provisioning Metadata, such as strings, icons, and other marketing collateral Formatting information to display the item in the portal We've pre-populated the Marketplace with a variety of images and templates that have been identified as the most useful services. Customers can request for additional resources to be added, provided they are approved for use on Azure Stack Hub. For a full list of available items, see here . Customers are responsible for ensuring that they have appropriate licensing and support in place for any items deployed from the Marketplace not licensed by UKCloud. Licensing We can provide: Microsoft operating system and application licensing Red Hat Enterprise Linux licensing For the latest available licences, check the Service Definition . You can bring your own licensing for Red Hat and certain Microsoft application licensing under Microsoft Mobility using software assurance. If customers provide their own licensing, they must inform UKCloud (by raising a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal) for a retrospective discount. For non-UKCloud issued software, customers must obey the licensing requirements of the software provider. This includes being aware of any constraints around using the software in a virtualised environment. VM server images We provide base VM images for the operating systems for which we provide licensing, along with images for various free Linux distributions (such as Ubuntu, CentOS and Debian). Customers can access these from the Marketplace available within the UKCloud Azure Stack Hub portal. Customers can use their own images for non-Windows and RHEL services, where licensing stipulates that to use the VM on our platform it must be licensed (and reported back to the software vendor) by UKCloud. We do not provide anti-virus software as part of the service. UKCloud Azure Stack Hub Service provisioning After we receive a purchase order for a Private Azure Stack Hub, we'll contact the customer to advise when the environment will be available. UKCloud will create the customer's Primary Administrator account and send a Welcome Pack, which includes the URLs for the UKCloud Portal and Getting Started Guide. We've created several articles, guides and FAQs to help customers get up and running quickly and easily. These are available within this Knowledge Centre. UKCloud also has a large ecosystem of partners who can deliver additional services, such as support and professional services. UKCloud would be pleased to introduce customers to the right partner to suit their needs. UKCloud Azure Stack Hub platform management Customers can access, manage and view the UKCloud for Microsoft Azure service, accessing only those features allowed by their role, in any of the following ways: Azure Stack Hub API. Enables the programmatic creation and management of the services inside the platform. Azure Stack Hub portal. Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to access the Azure Stack Hub environment (depending on assigned permissions). UKCloud Portal. Access to incident and request management. Customers cannot access the underlying infrastructure. This includes (but isn't limited to) the hardware. UKCloud Azure Stack Hub customer responsibilities Customers are responsible for: Defining which Azure Active Directory (AAD) to link their UKCloud for Microsoft Azure service to. Customers can link to their existing AAD or ask UKCloud to create a new AAD solely for the use of this service. Assessing whether the UKCloud platform can support the various requirements of their application. The control and management of access and responsibilities for end users, including appropriate connectivity, security and accreditation if required. If access is required over government community networks (PSN, HSCN, Janet or RLI), customers are responsible for adhering to the relevant Code of Connection (CoCo) and for providing evidence of their CoCo to UKCloud upon request. UKCloud is unable to provide access to secure networks where customers have not provided the required evidence. Management and administration of layers above the hypervisor (OS patching, application performance monitoring, user administration). Ensuring only lawful data that supports the UK Public Sector is stored and processed by applications on this environment, and that they fully comply with the UKCloud Security Operating Procedures (SyOPs) and other information assurance requirements as specified in the UKCloud SISP and associated accreditation documentation sets. UKCloud Azure Stack Hub support Service reporting Visibility. Customers can use the UKCloud Azure Stack Hub portal to configure multiple views of their estate and monitor the health of their services in real time. This includes utilisation of individual components, alerts and recent operations. Billing. We provide customers with monthly bills covering their monthly spend. Protective Monitoring We've implemented GPG 13-aligned Protective Monitoring across the Assured and Elevated security domains at the hypervisor level and below. For more information, see Protective Monitoring from UKCloud . We don't provide Protective Monitoring services above the hypervisor (for example, for a VM). It's the customers responsibility to act at this level. In line with UKCloud's System Interconnect and Security Policy (SISP), we provide notification of customer-impacting security incidents. It's the customers responsibility to report similar incidents to us. UKCloud Azure Stack Hub service availability The availability of VMs in UKCloud for Microsoft Azure follows the same principles of the Microsoft Azure public cloud, where customers achieve a higher service level availability based on how they architect the solution. The service levels are as follows: 99.90% (a single VM deployed as a single instance deployed inside a zone) 99.95% (a single VM with two instances deployed inside a zone) Tip To qualify for the higher service level, we advise that customers use on-platform tools, such as availability sets, that ensure VMs are provisioned to different hardware in the zone. We highly recommend duplicating workloads across two separate Azure Stack Hub regions for higher availability. Service background VMs are fully provisioned. The system is configured to automatically balance resources, so VMs may be moved between physical hosts. We actively capacity-manage the cloud platform to ensure customers have access to the resources they request. Customers can specify the site where they would like to have their service provisioned (from sites where UKCloud for Microsoft Azure is available). The UKCloud for Microsoft Azure service is updated regularly with the latest code release from Microsoft. Typically, this is once a month and UKCloud aim to be within two updates from Microsoft, however, we'll control the release of the patches into the live service. Through the UKCloud Azure Stack Hub portal, customers can use availability sets so that VMs do not run on the same physical host. Customers can make additional configurations inside a VM (such as acting as a secondary hypervisor or implementing third-party software technologies), however, we do not support these customer implementations. Service maintenance windows For UKCloud Azure Stack Hub, Planned and Emergency Maintenance are not included in the SLA. For information about Planned and Emergency Maintenance, see Understanding UKCloud service maintenance windows . Azure public cloud UKCloud is a Tier 1 Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) and so is able to offer support and delivery of Microsoft Azure public services. To take advantage of the services, customers just need to nominate UKCloud as their CSP. By nominating UKCloud as their CSP, customers get access to: 24/7 UK-based support with adherence to standard UKCloud response times (P1 in under 15 minutes), with 3rd line escalation support into Microsoft Consolidated billing for all UKCloud services, with UKCloud owning resolving billing challenges with Microsoft Ongoing service optimisation and architecture support For UKCloud to support a customer's Azure public environment, the CSP agreement must be in UKCloud's name as the Tier 1 CSP.

    "title": "Cross Domain Security Zone FAQs",
    "keywords": "Cross Domain Security Zone FAQs Service What is the service? The UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone (CDSZ) enables customers to transfer data securely between the UKCloud Assured OFFICIAL and UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL security domains using NCSC-approved cross-domain security patterns. This allows solutions hosted on the Elevated OFFICIAL security domain that are citizen-facing to be accessed securely from the internet. Note UKCloud Guard is no longer available as an option for CDSZ. All new CDSZ deployments must follow the Walled Garden design. We will continue to provide support to customers who previously added UKCloud Guard to their environment, although we would encourage using Walled Garden instead. Do I have to buy other UKCloud services to use services in the CDSZ? Yes. UKCloud cross-domain services are available only to customers purchasing other UKCloud services, such as IaaS (compute and storage) or PaaS (UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift). Is there a free trial available for CDSZ? The complex assurance requirements mean that trials aren't available. What is the process for applying for a service in the CDSZ? You can find the information you need in the UKCloud Knowledge Centre, including a detailed description of the assurance process, in UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone application process . How do I enable access from the internet to my solution hosted on the Elevated OFFICIAL security domain? For citizen-facing solutions hosted on the Elevated OFFICIAL security domain that need to be accessible from the internet, you can build your own solution using the Walled Garden. With the Walled Garden, you can create your own inspection, anti-malware and security services in the CDSZ between the internet-facing components on the Assured OFFICIAL security domain and the higher-security components hosted on the Elevated OFFICIAL security domain. Use of CDSZ Walled Garden is subject to approval by the data owner SIRO. Direct connectivity into the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL security domain via the internet is possible using a CAPS-approved VPN solution utilising government-grade encryption products (for example, Kryptor). CPA-approved (or equivalent standard) VPN solutions may be used subject to approval by the UKCloud SIRO. UKCloud can host the IPsec VPN gateway device within the Elevated OFFICIAL security domain, but procurement, configuration and ongoing management of the solution are your responsibility. UKCloud also offers Secure Remote Access , a CPA-approved VPN solution that allows access to the Elevated OFFICIAL security domain via a self-managed walled garden within the CDSZ. Are there any bandwidth limitations for traffic traversing the walled garden firewalls in and out of the CDSZ? Yes, there is a 10Gbps throughput limitation to the CDSZ in both Farnborough and Corsham. Is there storage capacity on CDSZ virtual machines (VMs)? The storage capacity of a VM in the CDSZ is 60GB. UKCloud cannot provide additional storage in the CDSZ for designs involving patch repositories. We advise customers to engage a UKCloud solutions architect to create a design that allows use of storage on the Assured or the Elevated security domain. What information do I need to include in my application for a service in the CDSZ? You can find detailed information about how to apply for CDSZ in UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone application process . What is Walled Garden? We provide self-service access to the CDSZ so that customers can create their own walled gardens using the technology and application services of their choice. We provide an assurance wrap by ensuring that customers use appropriate risk management techniques to understand and mitigate identified risks. Is there a setup fee for a Walled Garden? No. What is the assurance wrap? Because a Walled Garden solution is bespoke, we offer an assurance wrap to guide customers towards an effective design that will help to maximise their chances of meeting compliance requirements. The variable nature of Walled Garden solutions means we may charge for complex assurance wraps. This is done on a SFIA Rate Card basis, according to the number of days' assistance needed. What is the process for approving a Walled Garden? You can find detailed information about how to apply for CDSZ Walled Garden in UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone application process . What type of evidence is required to allow use of the Walled Garden? The evidence pack will generally consist of: IT Security Health Check (ITSHC) This must be carried out by an NCSC-approved security organisation Protective Monitoring solution The nature of Walled Garden solutions makes it essential that appropriate audit logging of security events and information is implemented and regularly monitored. Customer SIRO sign-off We need an accreditor's statement confirming their acceptance of the risk assessment, mitigating controls and residual risks, and their understanding of the customer's obligations relating to the use of UKCloud services You can find more information in UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone application process . What are the ongoing requirements? When the Walled Garden is in operation, the customer is responsible for ensuring continuing compliance with security operating procedures (SyOps) and other security obligations. Customers will also be expected to perform an annual ITHC on the environment. How long will the assurance process take? The bespoke nature of the Walled Garden means we can't provide committed timescales for each phase in the process. However, we aim to provide feedback from a named source within five days of each submission. Who makes the final decision to allow or deny the use of a Walled Garden? The UKCloud SIRO is ultimately responsible for deciding which solutions and configurations are allowed. What is the UKCloud Guard? UKCloud Guard is no longer available as an option for CDSZ. All new CDSZ deployments must follow the Walled Garden design. We will continue to provide support to customers who previously added UKCloud Guard to their environment, although we would encourage using Walled Garden instead. Support How do I raise a support ticket?- Our secure online Portal provides service management functionality. Alternatively, you can reach support by phone or email. How do I manage my services? Walled Gardens are managed from the higher-security side of the platform (Elevated OFFICIAL). The security requirements are much stricter and require a PSN-approved connection, UKCloud Secure Remote Access or CPA-approved (or equivalent standard) encryption. What are your service maintenance windows? See Understanding UKCloud service maintenance windows . Billing and legal How will I be billed? CDSZ has a minimum commitment period of one month. Walled Garden billing is based on the solution design. You pay a monthly rental fee, with additional charges based on the number of VMs required to run the solution. The monthly charge applies for each Walled Garden, not per customer. For existing UKCloud Guard customers, billing is based on the amount of data transferred between domains. You buy a starter pack which includes an amount of data that can be transferred. You're billed at an incremental rate for data transferred above the starter pack threshold. How can I pay for the services? Payment for UKCloud services can be made by direct bank transfer (BACS/CHAPS). You can find bank details for payment on your invoice. What are the termination fees? There are no termination fees for CDSZ. We may make an additional charge for professional services associated with transferring data out of the service if this is required. Security What data is suitable for the UKCloud assured security domain? The platform is hosted in the UK and operated by SC-cleared staff. It has extensive independent validation that it is fully aligned with NCSC Cloud Security Principles, making it ideal for all data classified at OFFICIAL (including OFFICIAL SENSITIVE). Is there a protective monitoring service? Protective monitoring is included for our IaaS platform and follows GPG 13.

    "title": "Getting Started Guide for the Cross Domain Security Zone",
    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for the Cross Domain Security Zone Overview The UKCloud Walled Garden provides self-service access to the Cross Domain Security Zone (CDSZ) so that you can design, implement and manage your own cross‑domain solution, using technology and application services of your choice. UKCloud provides an assurance wrap by managing firewalls between the security domains and ensuring you use appropriate risk management to understand and mitigate identified risks. The Walled Garden is ideal if you require more control and flexibility over what is passed between security domains, to support a wider range of use cases. This guide covers the steps you need to follow to get your Walled Garden up and running. Intended audience This guide is intended for customers who have: Completed the CDSZ Walled Garden assurance wrap Been approved to have a Base Implementation of the Walled Garden to allow data to pass between the Assured and Elevated security domains on the UKCloud platform Before you begin Before you can start to implement a walled garden, you must have completed and passed the appropriate application process. For more information, see the UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone application process . After your Walled Garden application has been approved, a service request is raised to implement the Walled Garden virtual data centre (VDC) and, if necessary, Elevated and Assured VDCs. Note If a service request for this implementation already exists, the existing request is used and a new one is not raised. You can track the progress of the service request in the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. During the provisioning of the Walled Garden service, we'll ask you for some additional information via the service request: The customer account in which you would like the Walled Garden VDC to be provisioned, if different from the customer completing the Walled Garden application. Whether you plan to have a single or dual site solution. How many VDCs you need to be set up in each security domain. If you're connecting new or existing VDCs to the Walled Garden VDC. If you're connecting to existing VDCs, we'll need to know information such as network firewall tennant (NFT) details, customer account, and so on. The external source IP addresses from which you'd like to access the Assured VDC (up to a maximum of 50). These IP addresses are the locations from which you can build and test the environment (for example, offices or end user premises). The build phase of the Walled Garden environment can take up to 10 working days depending on the complexity of the deployment. When the environment has been fully provisioned, your Service Delivery Manager (SDM) will send you the information you need to access it. Building your Walled Garden service As soon as you have access to your environment, you can start to build your Walled Garden services. It is important to remember that while the UKCloud Portal for the Assured security domain is accessible from the internet, the Portal for the Elevated security domain and Walled Garden services is accessible only through the PSN Protected network or through UKCloud's Secure Remote Access (SRA) service. Setting up your networking First, you need to replicate the networking that you set out in your Walled Garden application diagrams. This involves the creation of external and internal networking, as well as the creation of rules on the virtual firewall within your environment. For information about creating networks and firewall rules, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware and How to build a virtual machine with UKCloud for VMware . You also need to create the rules that allow connectivity between the different VDCs through the Walled Garden. This involves the creation of firewall rules, static routes and/or network address translation (NAT) rules. Networking examples There are two options for networking between the VDCs in the Walled Garden service: Option 1: Create static routes between the VDCs; this is the simplest option for connecting VDCs Option 2: Use NAT rules on top of the static routes; this option may be appropriate if you want to abstract the static routes The diagrams below provide examples for both options. Note For both options: You cannot route public IP addresses to the vCNS Edges in the Walled Garden The Org VDC networks 192.168.XXX.XX in the examples below are illustrative and you should replace these with your own details You must have one virtual machine (VM) in the Walled Garden VDC connecting to both vCNS Edges Each of the examples below assumes that the appropriate firewall rules are in place You must apply an SNAT rule in the Elevated security domain to enable connectivity to UKCloud services Building your virtual machines The next step is to build the VMs that you outlined in the Walled Garden application. This involves deploying the VMs from either the VMware Cloud Director catalog or from template VMs as Open Virtualization Format (OVF) files. The VMs must be able to access UKCloud services, such as OS repositories, the network time server, the Key Management Server (KMS), and so on. You may also need to access external services, such as antivirus repositories. You must configure this access in your VDC networking. For more information about creating VMs and accessing UKCloud services, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware . Testing your environment When you've built your VMs and networking, you can start to test the environment. If you've configured the networking correctly, your VMs should be able to talk to each other across the Walled Garden. If you have any issues, check your network rules. Performing the IT Health Check As part of the CDSZ application process, you're required to outline any IT Health Check (ITHC) you intend to perform on the environment. The ITHC should be conducted by an independent CHECK Service Provider, approved and classified as Green Light by the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). You can verify appropriate providers on the NCSC web site . Before beginning the ITHC, notify UKCloud by raising a service request in My Calls and completing the External Security Review Test (ESRT) application form . Ideally, we require five working days' notice before the work is due to be carried out. The ITHC scope should be relevant to the environment. For example, if you're using the Walled Garden to pull application and antivirus updates from the internet, then security controls relevant to facilitate this should be in scope. Bear in mind that the end customer accreditor may dictate the scope of the ITHC.

    "keywords": "How to access UKCloud services from Walled Garden and Secure Remote Access Overview If you've implemented either Secure Remote Access (SRA) or a Cross Domain Security Zone (CDSZ) Walled Garden solution and want to access UKCloud services (such as WSUS, KMS or Red Hat Update Service), you'll need to edit your edge gateway settings to enable access. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have VMware Cloud Director administrator access to a virtual data centre (VDC) in the Elevated OFFICIAL security domain. Before you begin Before making network changes to your environment, you'll need the following information: The Transit IP for the Elevated edge gateway of your CDSZ or SRA VDC The Transit IP for the edge gateway of your Elevated VDC The IP of the service you require. To get the last two octets of the IP addresses for the service you require, raise a Service Request on the UKCloud Elevated Portal. Setting up access to UKCloud services You need to add two static routes and an SNAT rule on two edge gateways. In VMware Cloud Director, locate the edge gateway that is attached to the Elevated side in your CDSZ or SRA VDC. Create a static route that directs traffic for the service you need via the Transit IP of your Elevated edge gateway. For more detailed instructions, see How to create a static route . Create an SNAT rule on your Elevated VDC to allow the private IP range from your CDSZ or SRA to have external access. For more detailed instructions, see How to create NAT rules . Amend the firewall to allow the private IP range access to the service you require on your Elevated VDC. For more detailed instructions, see How to create firewall rules Add a static route for the return traffic on your Elevated VDC to point to the Transit IP of your CDSZ or SRA VDC. Next steps Now that you've set up access to UKCloud services, you can register your VMs with those services.

    "title": "UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone application process",
    "keywords": "UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone application process Overview The UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone (CDSZ) enables you to securely transfer data between our Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL security domains using NCSC-approved cross-domain security patterns. Using the CDSZ you can create applications that are accessible to citizens, but ensure data safety. This document provides an overview of the UKCloud process to be used by customers wanting to purchase CDSZ services (Walled Garden and Secure Remote Access). There are two approaches to applying for CDSZ services: A light touch design review/self-assessment route for customers with simple implementations, or those who are experienced at designing secure solutions. This enables customers who are comfortable with the risk associated with their data to choose which controls and evidence they feel is appropriate to self-certify their cross domain solution. An assurance wrap style approach with UKCloud's experienced professionals for more complex implementations or those customers who would like support and guidance when developing their solutions. This enables customers who require more support to submit their proposed solution with confidence that it effectively mitigates against risk. In this document, the customer is the UKCloud customer, who may or may not be the ultimate end user of the application. The customer will be responsible for completing any compliance process with the end user, including obtaining sign-off from the relevant data owner. The data owner should be a permanent employee at the data owning organisation with evidence of data ownership, for example an IT Security Officer (ITSO), Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO) or accreditor. The data owner can choose to sign off for a single CDSZ implementation or setup a Tell Us Once agreement that signs off all future CDSZ implementations for the customer on behalf of the data owning organisation. UKCloud will maintain a list of all Tell Us Once agreements and any subsequent CDSZ applications by the customer on behalf of the data owner should reference this agreement. Process overview The following table provides more detail about each stage: Stage Name Description 1 Initial Contact Customer contacts UKCloud to register interest in CDSZ service. This can be through My Calls or direct contact with a Sales representative, Service Delivery Manager or Cloud Architect. 2a Self-Assessment Customer creates document pack to illustrate the solution design and provide evidence that all necessary sign-offs and compliance have been obtained. 2b Assurance Wrap Review Customer creates document pack with assistance from the UKCloud compliance team and Cloud Architect. 3 Design Review Customer presents the technical solution to Cloud Architect for advice and feedback. 4 Application Submission Customer raises a Service Request and submits document pack. 5 Service Implementation UKCloud provisions service and customer implements their solution. 6 On-Going Compliance UKCloud annually prompts customer to review existing document pack and provide updated information for any changes to design or approvals. Required documents When you apply for a CDSZ service, you must provide the following documents to show that you have identified and mitigated for any risks: Details of your proposed implementation that covers the intended design in the CDSZ, the Assured and Elevated VDCs you are connecting to and data flows. Evidence (for example, email or signed document) of acceptance of risk from the data owning organisation. This should also indicate if this acceptance is a Tell Us Once agreement that will also apply to future CDSZ implementations by the customer on behalf of the data owner. Note If a Tell Us Once agreement is already in place between the customer and the data owner, this evidence is not required, but the customer should indicate that such an agreement is in place so that UKCloud can confirm against our list of trusted partners for the data owner. An explicit statement, as part of the Service Request, that the solution has been reviewed by a named UKCloud Cloud Architect or that you do not require a review. The named Cloud Architect must provide review notes as evidence that the review took place. See Stage 3: Design review . If you're connecting to a PSN Protected enabled VDC, proof of PSN compliance (a copy of PSN CoCo or PSN CoP). Stage 1: Initial contact If you want to use the CDSZ, you can initiate the application process in one of two ways: Raise a Service Request through My Calls , specifying the relevant CDSZ product (Walled Garden or Secure Remote Access). One of our Sales representatives, Service Delivery Managers, or Cloud Architects will arrange a call to discuss your requirements and then close the Service Request. Contact one of our Sales representatives, Service Delivery Managers, or Cloud Architects directly to arrange a call to discuss your requirements. During your initial conversation, our Cloud Architect will discuss your proposed implementation and help determine the best approach for your situation: If your implementation is simple, or you're confident with designing a solution that mitigates the risk associated with your data and choosing the controls and evidence appropriate to that solution, you can follow our self-assessment option. If your implementation is complex, or you'd prefer some guidance to identify risks and how to mitigate against them, we can provide an assurance wrap style approach with our experienced professionals for more complex implementations. The following table lists some examples of simple versus complex designs: Criteria Simple Complex Business case Common use cases, aligned with Government Digital Strategy. Use cases where no precedent has been established. Multi-tenant solutions. Technical architecture Standard architecture compliant with NCSC design patterns or UKCloud published blueprints. Deviations from established models or blueprints. Non-fully virtualised solutions, for example with elements of hosting within our Cloud Enablement service. Risk ownership Clear accreditation by a single recognised SIRO within a UK public sector organisation. Shared accreditation. Accreditation by private sector authority. Stage 2a: Self-assessment If you choose to self-assess your implementation, you must gather all the documents listed in Required Documents. With self-assessment, you can still request a design review from one of our Cloud Architects. See Stage 3: Design review . Stage 2b: Assurance wrap review If you choose an assurance wrap review for your proposed implementation, the UKCloud compliance team and Cloud Architects will work with you to help identify risks to your solution. This includes: Review of design and data flow with a Cloud Architect (see Stage 3: Design review ) Advice and guidance for how to design secure solutions with appropriate monitoring and logging Conversation between UKCloud SIRO and customer SIRO or nominated representative covering risk management and mitigation, with further workshops if required Review of customer-defined ITHC scope and summary with a Cloud Architect Note UKCloud takes no ownership or responsibility for the implementation or running of your proposed solution or ownership for any risks to the data. Note UKCloud reserves the right to charge SFIA day rate charges for time spent on customer projects if you disengage with the assurance wrap review process before completion. At the end of the review period, you will have generated all the necessary documents to apply for your CDSZ service (as listed in Required documents ). Stage 3: Design review The design review is facilitated by a Cloud Architect and will gather a clearer understanding of how the proposed design aligns with recognised good security practice. Present your technical solution to a Cloud Architect. You can do this via teleconference, Webex or face-to-face as appropriate. The Cloud Architect will be looking to see evidence of effective mitigation for common risks (for example, technical controls like firewall, anti-malware and protective monitoring). The Cloud Architect will provide advice and guidance on aspects of the solution that are likely to raise concerns. You may revise your design to incorporate feedback from the design review. Note If you are self-assessing your proposed implementation, this stage is optional but you must provide a statement in your document pack indicating that you do not require a review. Stage 4: Application submission Raise a Service Request, via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal, specifying the relevant CDSZ product (Walled Garden or Secure Remote Access) and attach all the required documents , as well as any review notes from the assurance wrap review. This request will then be assigned to a UKCloud representative to verify that all required information has been provided. If any documents are missing or empty, a UKCloud representative will contact you to ensure that all required documents are provided before the service is provisioned. Stage 5: Service implementation When the assigned UKCloud representative has determined that all the appropriate information has been provided, the requested CDSZ service will be provisioned within five working days. When your service has been provisioned, you can implement your proposed solution. Stage 6: On-going compliance On an annual basis, UKCloud requires evidence of on-going compliance. You will be contacted by your Service Delivery Manager to review the existing documents and inform us if any of the details or approvals have changed. If you're connecting to a PSN Protected enabled VDC, proof of PSN compliance (a copy of PSN CoCo or PSN CoP) must be provided on a yearly basis. Once the relevant PSN certificate (if required) is provided, and provided there are no changes the original design, your CDSZ service will continue without interruption. If, after examination of the existing documents, you identify that there have been changes, for example if the design has changed from the initial solution or there is a different data owner approver, it is your responsibility to submit a revised evidence pack within 15 days. A UKCloud representative will contact you to discuss your changes. Feedback If you find a problem with this article, click Improve this Doc to make the change yourself or raise an issue in GitHub.

    "title": "Cross Domain Security Zone Blueprint",
    "keywords": "Cross Domain Security Zone Blueprint Overview Our customers' requirements range from relatively low-security solutions that are natively accessible on the internet, to solutions that must be more restricted and accessible only over government community networks such as the PSN, JANET or HSCN. To meet these varying needs, we've implemented two security domains on our platform, both of which are accredited for hosting systems and data classified at OFFICIAL: Assured OFFICIAL security domain ― directly connected to our DDoS-protected internet, PSN, JANET and HSCN networks Elevated OFFICIAL security domain — natively connected only to the PSN and RLI, it benefits from increased security as all users and devices that can access this security domain are known and trusted The Government Digital Service (GDS) strategy of \"internet is okay\" is dividing opinion across government. On one hand, many applications that were initially PSN connected and only accessible by a closed community are now being connected to the internet, pushing security from the physical network layer to the services themselves, reducing cost and time to delivery. On the other hand, a lot of data is considered too sensitive to be stored in a directly internet-connected environment, where the attack vector of an internet connection creates too much risk. Where customers choose to host their sensitive data in a non-internet connected environment, but still require internet connectivity for some aspects of their service, they can connect their application components which are on Assured OFFICIAL to application components that on Elevated OFFICIAL. To connect these components, a customer must use a Cross Domain Security Zone (CDSZ), which provides a controlled interconnection between the lower-security domain (Assured OFFICIAL) and the higher-security domain (Elevated OFFICIAL). This Blueprint draws on our experience of working with government customers and NCSC to help architect cross-domain solutions. Key principles The role of the customer's accreditor We provide our Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL security domains. Our customers are responsible for the accreditation of the applications they run on either security domain, including any specific use of the UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone. The customer's accreditor is responsible for identifying, assessing and mitigating the specific risks to their individual solution that are created by the use of the UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone. As part of the customer's own assurance activities, we recommend engaging a CLAS or CCP Security Professional and have an IT Security Health Check carried out by a CHECK test provider. Effective risk mitigation When reviewing a UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone application document set, submitted for approval by a customer, UKCloud will expect to see a number of controls included in the solution to adequately mitigate the risks of exposing an application that uses particularly sensitive data to the internet. It isn't necessarily the case that all of these controls will be needed for a solution to be approved, but aiming to include as many of them as possible will help to ensure that the approval process requires less scrutiny, and that the solution can move to the implementation phase much more quickly. Listed below are the controls we believe UKCloud and customer SIROs will expect to see in place when they review a solution that requires the UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone capability. Controls Protective Monitoring and possibly a Security Operations Centre (SOC) Information Assurance Standard (IS) 1 and IS2 Technical Risk Assessment IS1 is a government standard for risk assessment IS2 is a government standard for risk management and accreditation Risk Management and Accreditation Documentation Set (RMADS) Host-based intrusion detection (HIDS) Agents installed within virtual machines (VMs) that collect log data and alert on unusual behaviour or potentially forward to a SOC IT Security Health Check (CHECK) test Penetration test performed by an NCSC CHECK-approved tester Content type checking Security policy defining which content types are permitted (binary/xml/json etc) Deep content inspection Inspection of an HTTP request/response body, including, for example, things such as XML Schema validation or field length checking Data loss prevention Software that prevents data leaving an organisation without permission Anti-virus Consider how definitions are downloaded and made available to VMs Cross Domain Security Zone service options The UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone enables customers to securely transfer data between the UKCloud Assured OFFICIAL security domain and the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL security domain using NCSC-approved cross-domain security patterns. There are two service options available: Secure Remote Access. We provide a self-service remote access solution so that customers who do not have a PSN or RLI connection to their business premises may have a method of managing their environments within Elevated OFFICIAL. Note that this is for management purposes only, and not for end-user access to the Elevated security domain. This service is not covered within this Blueprint. Walled Garden. Self-service management of a Cross Domain Security Zone Walled Garden, enabling customers to implement security applications of their choice. We provide an assurance wrap by ensuring customers use appropriate risk management to understand and mitigate identified risks. How the Walled Garden works UKCloud Walled Garden is a single-tenant walled garden architecture, within a separate zone of the UKCloud platform that customers can populate with VMs to allow communication between applications on the Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL security domains. Customers have full control of the services within their walled garden, enabling them to transmit communications between security domains using any protocols required. Protocols and traffic include RDP, SSH, binaries, and management protocols such as SNMP and NMI. When a customer implements a walled garden, they need to take precautions to ensure the integrity and availability of data across both security domains. These precautions must be documented in the Cross Domain Security Zone submission. Traffic through the walled garden can originate from either Assured or Elevated OFFICIAL. The walled garden can be a target for single or multiple application servers in either platform, and can contain as many virtual machines as are needed to service application requests across the walled garden. The figure below shows an example of a possible setup, but it should be used as a starting point only; customers may want to populate their walled garden with more services to meet their needs. It's important to highlight that there is no pre-defined architectural pattern that a solution must fit into. To help, UKCloud can make recommendations about the architectures that are likely to be approved by the customer accreditors. However, this will be guidance only — each solution will be approved by the end-customer data owner before UKCloud will allow the customer to build. Assured OFFICIAL security domain The Assured OFFICIAL security domain should have: Firewall rules to tightly control traffic to the applications which will talk across the walled garden Anti-virus Protective monitoring Additional techniques to further secure the solution should be used if possible: OS and application hardening to reduce services running on the server, decreasing the surface of vulnerability Logging of events on the server for auditing purposes, with logs included in the protective monitoring solution Content checking to ensure the integrity of data and provide a defence against content attacks It is recommended that it should have an anti-virus product that differs from other anti-virus products used in the overall solution. Walled Garden The Walled Garden consists of a single-tenant walled garden architecture which should include: A protocol break and re-creation, for example by using a reverse proxy Inspection of the data to validate the message structure or message content, to ensure the messages used to convey the application data are correctly encoded, and to confirm that the content within the messages are as expected IDS and logging of events on the VMs for auditing purposes, and alert generation for messages that fail the validation process as part of a protective monitoring solution Anti-virus Other considerations for the Walled Garden include: OS and application hardening to reduce services running on the server, decreasing the surface of vulnerability Implementation of release controls to enforce a whitelist of the data types and content permitted for release through the Walled Garden Direction control for data moving from either high-to-low or low-to-high domains; for example, best practice is to prevent 'pull' requests from the application in the low domain It's good practice to run non-SSL traffic so the Walled Garden doesn't need to decrypt and re-encrypt to inspect the messages. Customers can have different VMs within a single walled garden instance servicing different requests to span the two domains. For example, a customer could have software updates and protective monitoring traffic being serviced by the same VMs within the walled garden. Elevated OFFICIAL security domain The Elevated OFFICIAL security domain should have: Firewall rules to tightly control traffic to the applications that will talk across the Walled Garden Post-authentication to enable access control and auditing Anti-virus Protective monitoring with IDS Additional techniques to further secure the solution should be used if possible: OS and application hardening to reduce services running on the server, decreasing the surface of vulnerability Logging of events on the VMs for auditing purposes, with logs included in the protective monitoring solution Content checking to ensure the integrity of data and provide a defence against content attacks It should also be configured with an anti-virus product that differs from other anti-virus products used in the overall solution. Networking Applications that communicate across the Walled Garden should be placed on a dedicated network segment that can be securely segregated from other segments using firewall rules, managed through the cloud technology's virtual firewalls such as NSX edges, or customers' own virtual firewalls. The inter-environment connections between the firewalls, from Assured OFFICIAL to the Walled Garden, and from the Walled Garden to Elevated OFFICIAL are all controlled by UKCloud to ensure that correct connectivity is maintained. The networking within the customer's environments, within Assured, Walled Garden and Elevated are the customer's responsibility. Customers can choose between two ways of routing traffic to the walled garden, and must state their choice before implementation: To terminate the connection to the walled garden at the edge, and then NAT the traffic into the walled garden To route the traffic directly into the walled garden The figure below shows the network topography for a typical walled garden. High availability The UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone is highly available within a single site. If site-level resilience is required, customers must buy a second Cross Domain Security Zone, which will be configured with the same policy as the primary site. The two instances can then be used: Active/passive via application configuration updates (for example change Walled Garden target in the event of a failure) In active/active configuration, which is perhaps more useful If Cross Domain Security Zone instances will be used in an active/active configuration, the customer needs to implement a load balancer in the Assured or Elevated tier (depending on the direction of the traffic flow) to send requests to both Cross Domain Security Zones. The approval process Every UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone implementation requires customer Data Owner and UKCloud approval before the customer can carry out any implementation work. The approval process is shown below. More information is available in the UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone application process . Step Description 1 Initial Contact Customer contacts UKCloud to register interest in the CDSZ service. This can be through My Calls or direct contact with a Sales representative, Service Delivery Manager or Cloud Architect. 2a Self-Assessment Customer creates the document pack to illustrate the solution design and provide evidence that all necessary sign-offs and compliance have been obtained. 2b Assurance Wrap Review Customer creates the document pack with assistance from the UKCloud compliance team and Cloud Architect. 3 Design Review Customer presents the technical solution to the Cloud Architect for advice and feedback. 4 Application Submission Customer raises a Service Request and submits the document pack. 5 Service Implementation UKCloud provisions the service and the customer implements their solution. 6 On-Going Compliance Once the implementation is in operation, the customer is responsible for ensuring continuing compliance with Security Operating procedures (SyOps) and other security obligations. UKCloud annually prompts customers to review the existing document pack and provide updated information for any changes to design or approvals. Required documents When you apply for a Cross Domain Security Zone service, you must provide the following documents to show that you have identified and mitigated for any risks: Details of your proposed implementation that covers the intended design in the CDSZ, the Assured and Elevated VDCs you are connecting to and data flows. Evidence (for example, email or signed document) of acceptance of risk from the data owning organisation. This should also indicate if this acceptance is a Tell Us Once agreement that will also apply to future CDSZ implementations by the customer on behalf of the data owner. If a Tell Us Once agreement is already in place between the customer and the data owner, this evidence is not required, but the customer should indicate that such an agreement is in place so that UKCloud can confirm against our list of trusted partners for the data owner. An explicit statement, as part of the Service Request, that the solution has been reviewed by a named UKCloud Cloud Architect or that you do not require a review. The named Cloud Architect must provide review notes as evidence that the review took place.

    "title": "Pricing information for Cross Domain Security Zone",
    "keywords": "Pricing information for Cross Domain Security Zone Overview Cross Domain Security Zone (CDSZ) pricing can be as low as £500 per month. Full pricing with all options is available in the UKCloud Pricing Guide . The self-managed Walled Garden is priced with a baseline monthly fee, with additional charges based on the number of VMs required to run the solution and their Snapshot Protection options. Pricing example VM size: Small Block storage used: 80GiB Tier 2 block storage Protection option: 14-day Snapshot Protection Baseline monthly fee The baseline monthly fee for CDSZ is £500 . VM cost per month A Small POWER VM costs £0.15 per hour. 14-day Snapshot Protection for a Small VM costs £0.12 per hour. In an average 730 hour month, the monthly VM cost works out at: Hours in operation x (VM + Protection = VM cost per month 730 x (£0.15 + £0.12) = £197.10 The Advanced Management bundle is not required so there is no additional uplift. Storage cost per month A Small VM includes 60GiB of free Tier 2 block storage, so an additional 20GiB is chargeable. Tier 2 block storage costs £0.10 per GiB month. 14-day Snapshot Protection for Tier 2 storage costs £0.10 per GiB per month. (Storage + Protection) x GiB used = Storage cost per month (£0.10 + £0.10) x 20 = £4.00 Total basic cost Calculate the total basic cost by adding together the monthly baseline fee and monthly VM and storage costs. Monthly fee VM cost per month + Storage cost per month = Total basic cost £500 £197.10 + £4.00 = £701.10 Discount options The following discount and purchase schemes are available with CDSZ: Commitment discount Cloud Credits For more information about the discount and purchase schemes offered by UKCloud, see the UKCloud Pricing Guide .

    "keywords": "Cross Domain Security Zone Service Scope About this document This document describes the boundaries of the Cross Domain Security Zone (CDSZ) service, along with the division of responsibilities between UKCloud and the customer, to facilitate the provisioning and ongoing use of the service. About Cross Domain Security Zone The CDSZ service provides a secure and flexible way to transfer data between your workloads hosted on the UKCloud Assured OFFICIAL security domain and the UKCloud non-internet connected Elevated OFFICIAL security domain. You can create your own VMs and data flows across the CDSZ in order to satisfy the requirements of your applications. Application process Customers wanting to use the CDSZ need to go through the CDSZ Application Process. This is documented in UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone application process . Service options CDSZ includes a Walled Garden option that provides self-service access to the CDSZ so that customers can create and manage virtual machines to fulfil their requirements using the technology and application services of their choice. Note UKCloud Guard is no longer available as an option for CDSZ. All new CDSZ deployments must follow the Walled Garden design. We will continue to provide support to customers who previously added UKCloud Guard to their environment, although we would encourage using Walled Garden instead. Service architecture The CDSZ Walled Garden is a VMware-only environment, utilizing VMware Cloud Director as the management orchestrator for the service. A CDSZ is a virtual datacenter (VDC) in which you can build virtual machines and virtual networks in order to inspect and protect data moving between Assured and Elevated cloud environments. You can find more information about architecting a CDSZ environment in the Getting Started Guide for the Cross Domain Security Zone Walled Garden . A CDSZ Walled Garden is a VMware only environment, however you can connect it to non-VMware cloud environments within UKCloud, such as Oracle or OpenStack. Storage options All workloads (except Micro) include 60GiB of Tier 2 storage for free. All storage is persistent and resilient to local hardware failures. You can purchase additional storage to support your application. You can use multiple storage options to support different aspects of the application. Tier 1. Our most performant storage for workloads requiring consistently higher disk throughput Tier 2. Persistent block storage with typical performance characteristics for use by production applications or storage Storage policies We provide you with access to two storage policies: Tier 1 and Tier 2. Both policies have a 1TiB soft-quota of storage. We do not guarantee storage performance, as it can be affected by many factors We do not provide IOPs figures for our storage offerings Workloads can use multiple storage profiles Protection Customers have a range of automated, on-platform protection options to choose from for their environments: Catalogue and template-based recovery. All customers have access to catalogue and template-based recovery as standard. This is a configuration management solution that can re-provision stateless servers to a new VM when required, using standard, and catalogue-based VM templates. Snapshot Protection. 14-day or 28-day snapshot policies available. Data protected by the snapshot has an RPO of 24 hours, with RTO determined by the time taken to restore the VM after the service request is raised. See the Snapshot Protection Service Scope for full details. Service availability The service level agreement (SLA) for CDSZ workloads guarantees 99.90% availability. You're entitled to claim Service Credits for outages to services that take you out of SLA. For more about how we calculate SLAs, see the SLA Definition . Service background We maintain the standard VM template sizes that control allocation of CPU and resources. VMs are fully provisioned. The system is configured to automatically balance resources, so your VMs may vMotion between physical hosts. To maintain performance across the platform, UKCloud can perform movements/migrations of VMs, vApps or storage within the infrastructure assigned to a service. We actively capacity-manage the cloud platform to ensure you have access to the resources you request. We control the deployed versions of technology on the platform. This covers internal platform-supporting technologies, and any technology versions available to you. Internally this includes, but isn't limited to, the vSphere and ESX versions, and the hardware version of the platform. Externally this includes the available versions of the edge gateway and VMware Cloud Director. Promiscuous mode is disabled. You can make additional configurations inside a VM (such as acting as a secondary hypervisor or implementing third-party software technologies). We do not support customer implementations inside a VM. Service resilience You can specify Farnborough or Corsham as the site where you'd like to have your CDSZ service provisioned. We'll try to accommodate requests and will advise you if we are unable do so. You can set affinity or anti-affinity rules through VMware Cloud Director so that VMs do, or do not, run on the same physical host. Operating systems Licensing We can provide: OS licensing through the SPLA and academic frameworks for Microsoft Red Hat Enterprise Linux licensing For the latest available licences, see the UKCloud Pricing Guide . You can bring your own licensing for Red Hat and certain Microsoft application licensing under Microsoft Mobility using software assurance. You should inform UKCloud via a Service Request if you're providing your own licensing for a retrospective discount. For non-UKCloud issued software, you must obey the licensing requirements of the software provider. This includes being aware of any constraints around using the software in a virtualised environment. VM server images We provide base VM images for the operating systems for which we provide licensing. You can access these from VMware Cloud Director. You can use your own images for non-Windows and RHEL services, where licensing stipulates that to use the VM on our platform it must be licensed (and reported back to the software vendor) by UKCloud. Update services We make update repositories available for all software for which we provide licensing. We don't provide software update facilities for non-UKCloud licensed software. Anti-virus We do not provide anti-virus software as part of the service. Networks From a customer management experience, you manage all your connectivity rules, such as firewall, IPsec VPN and NAT functionality, through your edge gateway, using either the VMware Cloud Director tenant portal or vCloud API. You can find more information about networking within the CDSZ in the Getting Started Guide for the Cross Domain Security Zone Walled Garden . Edge gateway By default, we assign two edge gateways per Walled Garden VDC: one facing Assured and one facing Elevated. You can have up to nine Org VDC networks per edge gateway. vApp edge vApp networks enable you to create smaller networks within individual vApps that have a vApp edge, similar to the edge gateway on your VDC. Although a vApp edge isn't as feature rich as an edge gateway, it lets you create firewall and NAT rules to separate your VDC networks from your vApp VMs. See How to create a vApp network for configuration details. Site-to-site IPsec VPN You can create IPsec VPN tunnels to connect from CDSZ edges to virtual firewalls in Assured or Elevated. There is a limit of 64 tunnels per edge gateway. Load balancing The edge gateway acts as a basic layer 3 load balancer, including features such as session persistence and health checks. If you need more advanced load balancing, you should consider a third-party product. Protective monitoring We have implemented GPG 13-aligned Protective Monitoring across the Assured and Elevated security domains at the hypervisor level and below. We don't provide Protective Monitoring services above the hypervisor (for example, for your VM); it is your responsibility to act at this level. In line with UKCloud's SISP, we provide notification of customer-impacting security incidents. It is your responsibility to report similar incidents to us. Platform management Users can access, manage and view the CDSZ service, accessing only those features allowed by their role, in any of the following ways: vCloud API. Enables the programmatic creation and management of VMs inside the CDSZ. VMware Cloud Director tenant portal. Provides a graphical interface to access the VMware Cloud Director environment (depending on assigned permissions). UKCloud Portal. Enables the creation of compute services and subsequently VDCs and edge gateways. The Portal also includes an overview of actual and estimated spend, along with service configuration information. Access to incident and request management is also possible through the Portal. You cannot access the underlying infrastructure. This includes (but isn't limited to) the hardware and the vSphere environment. Service reporting Visibility Maintenance notifications and Service Status reports are delivered through the Portal. Billing We provide you with monthly bills covering your monthly spend. Customer service Cloud Architect. UKCloud Cloud Architects support you during the design of solutions for the cloud platform. UKCloud Cloud Architects are ideally placed to help reconcile your requirements with the UKCloud platform. We recommend engagement with a Cloud Architect when implementing a CDSZ Walled Garden. Service Delivery Manager (SDM). An assigned point of contact who will provide any assistance you require during your use of the service, including onboarding, service reviews and incident reporting and escalation. Support Desk. After the initial on-boarding and design phase, you can utilise the standard UKCloud support entitlement, which is documented in the Customer Engagement Factsheet . Customer responsibilities You are responsible for: Assessing whether the UKCloud platform can support the various requirements of your application. Completing and submitting a CDSZ application form in order to be granted access to a CDSZ Walled Garden. The control and management of access and responsibilities for end users including appropriate connectivity, security and accreditation if required. If access is required over government secure networks (HSCN, Janet, RLI or PSN), you are responsible for adhering to the relevant Code of Connection (CoCo) and for providing evidence of your CoCo to UKCloud upon request. UKCloud is unable to provide access to secure networks where such evidence has not been provided by the customer. Management and administration of layers above the hypervisor (OS patching, application performance monitoring, user administration). Ensuring only lawful data that supports the UK Public Sector is stored and processed by applications on this environment, and that you fully comply with the UKCloud Security Operating Procedures (SyOPs) and other information assurance requirements as specified in the UKCloud System Interconnect and Security Policy (SISP) and associated accreditation documentation sets. Service provisioning Within 4 hours of accepting an order (shorter deployment times are typically achieved and can be prioritised upon request), UKCloud will create the customer's Primary Administrator account and send a Welcome Pack, which includes the URL for the UKCloud Customer Portal, and the Getting Started Guide. Customers will have two options when purchasing a CDSZ service. A light-touch design review/self-assessment route for customers with simple implementations, or those who are experienced at designing secure solutions. An assurance-wrap style approach with UKCloud's experienced professionals for more complex implementations or those customers who would like support and guidance when developing their solutions. Both options require the same submission documentation to enable UKCloud to provision the service. Deployment time following validation of the assurance document set is 5 days. This includes the setup and configuration of customer specific firewall requirements. UKCloud has created several videos, help guides, manuals and FAQs to help train and instruct users so that they are up and running quickly and easily. These are available within the Knowledge Centre. UKCloud also has a large ecosystem of partners who can deliver additional services, such as support and professional services. UKCloud would be pleased to introduce you to the right partner to suit your needs.

    "title": "Cloud Storage FAQs",
    "keywords": "Cloud Storage FAQs Service What is the service? Cloud Storage from UKCloud is a secure next-generation storage platform designed to address a wide variety of use cases. It's based on Dell EMC Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS), which is an object storage technology natively optimised for cloud storage in terms of scale, resilience and accessibility. Where will my data be physically stored? Data will be stored in one or both of our highly resilient tier 3, UK-sovereign data centres, which are separated by over 100km. How much data can I store? Our Cloud Storage solution can scale to multi-Petabytes across multiple sites, meeting the most demanding storage requirements. How many copies of my data are included? Object storage technology works in a slightly different way to traditional local storage solutions that tend to use RAID as a method to provide data durability. Instead, Cloud Storage provides data resilience using the Reed Solomon 12 + 4 erasure coding scheme, which splits an object into 12 data fragments and 4 coding fragments. These fragments are spread across multiple nodes in the data centre and the storage engine can reconstruct an object from any of the 12 data fragments, providing protection in the event of a disk or node failure. The ENHANCED service level stores an additional copy of your data in our second, geographically remote data centre. Management How do I access the platform? The service is Application Programming Interface (API) accessible, so is an ideal target for customer applications. It can also be used by existing systems. In addition, the platform can be accessed using a variety of software tools such as cloud storage gateways, file browsers and other software products. Documentation on ways to interact with the platform is available in the Getting Started Guide for Cloud Storage . Is data accessible via the PSN connection also accessible via the internet? Cloud Storage in our Assured OFFICAL domain uses the same environment for both PSN and internet connections. Although it is not possible to bridge between these connections, any objects placed in Cloud Storage via PSN will also be accessible via the internet using the appropriate customer credentials. Can I restrict Cloud Storage access to specific networks? It is possible to lock Cloud Storage accounts down so that buckets are only accessible via a single network (for example HSCN, PSN, Janet), but we cannot lock down a bucket to a customer-specified source IP address or range. Important As we impose this restriction at a Cloud Storage user account level rather than the bucket itself, any new users that you add to the ECS account will be able to access associated buckets from ANY network until you request that we update our blacklist. To request network restrictions, raise a Service Request through https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/support/ivanti . Alternatively, you can contact support by phone or email. Which APIs are supported by the platform? Our Cloud Storage supports an Elastic Cloud Storage S3-compatible API. Documentation for supported API calls is available in the Getting Started Guide for Cloud Storage . How frequently can I back up data? The frequency of data backup is defined and managed by your organisation administrator. UKCloud's object storage is however highly durable and can automatically recover from disk and node failure, negating the need for a backup. What reports can I get about storage usage? We provide tools for monitoring used capacity and storage growth via the UKCloud Portal. What software tools are provided? UKCloud does not provide software tools for accessing the platform as storage is accessed via APIs, supporting S3. You can however directly connect any S3-compatible tools to your storage (for example, S3 Browser and Cyberduck). How do I create new Cloud Storage users? You can create additional users in the UKCloud Portal. For more information, see How to create a new Cloud Storage user in the UKCloud Portal . Support How do I raise a support ticket? UKCloud's secure online Portal provides the most common service management functionality, enabling you to raise support tickets through My Calls . Alternatively, you can contact support by phone or email. How do I manage my services? Cloud Storage on the Assured OFFICIAL domain can be managed over the internet (or other connectivity) via the UKCloud Portal. For the Elevated OFFICIAL domain, security requirements are stricter and require either a PSN-approved connection, UKCloud Secure Remote Access or CAPS-approved encryption. What are your service maintenance windows? See Understanding UKCloud service maintenance windows . Does the Cloud Storage solution support browser-based form POST upload? Cloud Storage fully supports standard REST API commands (Post, Put, Get, Delete, and Head). Cloud Storage's RESTful APIs support the use of HTML forms to create and update objects. Is Cloud Storage object synchronisation (for example, protection offered at each VM type) synchronous or asynchronous? Protection is asynchronous; a single copy is created, and subsequent copies of the data are created when bandwidth allows. During busy periods, this protection can take longer to complete. Onboarding How can I get started with the service? Within five days of accepting your order, we'll create your primary administrator account and send you a welcome pack, which includes the URL for the UKCloud Portal and associated authentication details. Once you've signed up to the service, you can access your unique credentials (User ID, Subtenant ID, resolvable hostname and shared secret) through the UKCloud Portal, which you simply enter into an EMC Cloud Tiering Appliance or other compatible automated solution. Why can't I see my secret key in the UKCloud Portal? For security reasons, the UKCloud Portal only displays a secret key for a short amount of time after it is set. After this time, the secret key is replaced with the text [FILTERED]. If you forget your secret key, or if it is compromised, you can reset it by clicking the Reset secret button in the Storage section of the Portal. When you reset your secret key, you'll be able to see it in the Portal for up to 24 hours before it is hidden. Billing and legal What is the smallest unit of time I will be billed for? Storage is billed on a per-GiB per-month basis, and is based on utilisation of the storage platform across the month. The minimum amount of time is one month. How is my storage bill calculated? Used storage is calculated on a daily basis. The data for a month is collected, and the average consumption calculated and rounded up to the next whole number to provide the number of GiB consumed in a month. The charge for the total storage is based on a tiering basis as per the Cloud Storage Service Definition . When your storage consumption moves into the next tier, only the amount of storage above the previous tier threshold is charged at the lower price. As an example, if you use 520TiB of storage in a month, your charges are calculated as: 250TiB x £0.0200 = £5,000 250TiB x £0.0180 = £4,500 20TiB x £0.0162 = £324 Total cost = £9,824 How can I view billing information? Billing information is provided in an evidence file on the first working day of the month for your previous months spend. How do I pay for the service and what are the termination fees? Billing for the service is one month in arrears and payment can be made by direct bank transfer. There are no termination fees for the service. You are responsible for extracting your own data from the platform if required. UKCloud may make an additional charge for transferring data out of the service. Is there a free trial? Yes, we offer a 30-day free trial so that you can test and evaluate our service without commitment. Your trial provides you with a live environment on the UKCloud platform to test our services and verify whether they are suited to your needs. Security What data is suitable for our cloud? The service is hosted in the UK and operated by security-cleared staff. It has extensive independent validation (including NCSC design reviews) that is fully aligned with the 14 NCSC Cloud Security Principles, and is therefore ideal for all data classified at Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL (including OFFICIAL SENSITIVE). How does traffic route in and out of the virtual data centres? Assured Cloud Storage clusters have access available from the internet, PSN, HSCN and Janet. Traffic does not leave the UKCloud platform. If you're using a government community network, your data never leaves that network. Elevated clusters do not have internet access. How is traffic secured in transit? Traffic in flight is encrypted in SSL packets. How do I encrypt my data-at-rest? Data at rest encryption is an optional feature of our Cloud Storage product, with no additional cost. To enable this feature, when you raise your Service Request to create a new bucket, specify that encryption at rest is required. There are three options available if you're looking to encrypt your data in Cloud Storage: Customer-managed encryption. You encrypt your data prior to moving it into UKCloud Cloud Storage. This avoids having to do any additional development against the ECS S3 API and ensures that you retain the keys used to encrypt the data. Server-side encryption at rest with system generated keys. You enable server-side encryption in the request headers when creating buckets using the S3-compatible API, without specifying the keys. In this case the keys are auto-generated by ECS, simplifying key management. However, you should be aware that the public and private keys used at the top of the hierarchy are shared between all customers encrypting their data through this method. See page 37 of the ECS Architecture whitepaper for more information on this encryption method. Server-side encryption at rest with user-supplied keys. You enable server-side encryption in the request header with user-supplied keys when creating buckets using the S3-compatible API. This increases complexity but ensures that you retain control of your keys when using server-side encryption. There is an example of this method on page 14 of the ECS Security Configuration guide (login required). Ultimately, it is down to you to select which encryption methodology should be used and understand the possible risks involved. Can systems on different UKCloud platforms communicate with one another? UKCloud's Cross Domain Security Zone allows you to use a customer-designed and managed Walled Garden to enable communication between platforms. For more information, see the Cross Domain Security Zone Service Definition . Is there a protective monitoring service? Yes, protective monitoring is included for our IaaS platform and follows GPG 13, more information can be found in Protective Monitoring from UKCloud .

    "title": "Getting Started Guide for Cloud Storage",
    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for Cloud Storage Introduction UKCloud's Cloud Storage service is an object storage solution based on Dell EMC Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS). Access is via a RESTful API, which also provides support for Amazon's S3 API. This Getting Started Guide covers the tasks you need to perform to get Cloud Storage up and running in your environment. It also looks at common use cases for API‑based object storage within web applications and provides information about some command-line tools that you can use to interact with the storage API. Intended audience This article is intended for users who are starting out with UKCloud's Cloud Storage service and want to learn more about how it works. Cloud Storage overview Cloud Storage: Is a secure and highly adaptable storage platform designed to address a wide variety of use cases Is based on object storage technology that is natively optimised for cloud storage in terms of scale, resilience and accessibility Removes the complexity of capacity management by utilising a pay‑as‑you‑go model, so you pay for what you use, when you use it, scaling indefinitely and on demand Natively provides application redundancy to ensure the highest level of data availability, whilst reducing the cost and management of on-premises storage solutions Provides easy access to storage anywhere, any time, to any device, using HTTP(S) to simplify the integration of object storage systems into cloud‑based solutions by removing the need to rely on the availability of web, file or FTP servers Offloads objects (files, media, images) from compute resources, reducing the load on server resources Automatically replicates and distributes objects to give high levels of data durability and availability, eliminating the need for cloud backup and recovery ECS provides an API that you can use to manage your cloud storage. The ECS S3-compatible API enables you to easily migrate applications between Atmos, S3 and other S3‑compatible storage; but not all functionality available in S3 is available on ECS, as shown in the S3 API supported and unsupported features section of the Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS) Data Access Guide . Note The ECS Atmos API has been deprecated, we therefore suggest customers re-engineer their solutions to make use of the defacto S3-compatible API. Cloud Storage use cases The low cost of cloud storage per GiB, as well as its almost unlimited scalability, means there's a large variety of use cases for it. For example, it's ideal for data archives, backups, log files, and media repositories. We anticipate that most web applications can make good use of cloud storage for static content, such as images and downloadable binaries. Storing these items in cloud storage (rather than in primary storage attached to web servers, inside the database or on a traditional file share), can provide significant benefits in terms of cost savings, agility and performance. For example, with an internet-facing application that enables users to download forms and guides in PDF, these items are often stored in primary storage attached to the web servers, which creates several challenges: Whenever a PDF is updated, the updated copy must be replicated to all web servers When an item is downloaded, the bandwidth usage of the web server in question increases Multiple simultaneous downloads could overload the web servers or other components of the network infrastructure Each object is stored multiple times in primary storage, increasing the overall cost of storage On the other hand, storing this content in cloud storage overcomes these challenges because: Only one copy of each item is stored, so updates only need to be made in one place End users connect directly to cloud storage to download PDFs, bypassing the web servers and associated network infrastructure Objects are stored only once, and at a much lower price per GiB, which substantially reduces the overall cost of storage The same principles apply to other static content, such as images and (especially) videos. The more workload you can offload onto an external system such as cloud storage, the leaner your application infrastructure can become. There are often questions around how best to implement this. Ultimately, it's up to the application developers, but a popular approach is as follows: Handle content uploads and creation on the web servers Perform any required modifications or transformations using on-demand processing servers (usually from a message queue) Write the content into cloud storage, storing the resulting object IDs, external URLs and any other relevant metadata in the application database This process provides a relatively simple transition to cloud storage. The application still knows about all the objects, but rather than retrieving, for example, a relative path for an item from the database, its entire URL is retrieved, pointing to cloud storage. Before you begin When you request your Cloud Storage service, UKCloud Support creates a namespace in the specified account. To create S3 buckets, use any S3-compliant tool. To create additional namespaces, you must raise a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. API endpoints Cloud Storage provides different API endpoints to access your storage, depending on the UKCloud site and connectivity type you are using. Make sure you use the correct endpoint to ensure the best possible performance for your solution. Corsham (Assured) Farnborough (Assured) Internet cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com cas.frn00006.ukcloud.com PSN cas.cor00005.psnassured.ukcloud.com cas.frn00006.psnassured.ukcloud.com HSCN cas.cor00005.ukcloud.thirdparty.nhs.uk/ cas.frn00006.ukcloud.thirdparty.nhs.uk/ Contact UKCloud support if you are unsure which endpoint to use. Using the ECS S3-compatible API The S3-compatible API is at: https://<api_endpoint> Check which api_endpoint to use in Before you begin , for example: https://cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com To help get you started, you can find developer resources on the Amazon web site at: https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/s3/ For details of the supported and unsupported S3 operations on ECS, see: http://doc.isilon.com/ECS/3.6/DataAccessGuide/GUID-E21545D1-8529-4E72-A49A-EE0834A201A9.html You may also find the Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS) Data Access Guide useful: http://doc.isilon.com/ECS/3.6/DataAccessGuide/GUID-CA0B1CAA-35BA-433D-8EB3-304DB47BE3CC.html Note Currently, the HSCN DNS service doesn't allow UKCloud to create wildcard DNS entries for our services. This means that S3 URLs that feature the bucket as part of the domain do not work (for example, bucket01.cas.frn00006.ukcloud.thirdparty.nhs.uk ). With most S3 tools, you can choose whether to use prefix buckets or suffix buckets. If you are using the service via HSCN you'll need to make sure your client tools support suffix buckets. Amazon S3 Authentication Tool for Curl The Amazon S3 Authentication Tool for Curl (S3Curl) is a very useful Perl script, developed by Amazon. It's a wrapper for Curl that calculates the required authentication signature automatically for each request. As the authentication signature changes for every request, this allows Curl to interact with the API outside of code, enabling you to validate that your commands are working correctly and view the raw HTML response from the API, which can be useful when troubleshooting. For more information about S3Curl, see https://aws.amazon.com/code/128 . To use S3Curl: Download S3Curl from the following location: https://github.com/UKCloud/s3curl Install the following required dependency: sudo apt-get install libdigest-hmac-perl yum install perl-Digest-HMAC In the home directory, create a file named .s3curl containing your credentials. For example: %awsSecretAccessKeys = ( UKCloud => { id => '<user_id>', key => '<secret_key>', }, ); Where: user_id is your User ID (you can find this in the Storage section of the UKCloud Portal) secret_key is your secret key (if you've forgotten or don't know your secret key, you can reset it in the Storage section of the UKCloud Portal) Change the permissions, otherwise the Perl script will refuse to run. chmod 600 .s3curl Make the following modification to the script itself so that it will work correctly with ECS: a. Open the s3curl.pl file in your preferred editor (for example, vim or nano). b. Scroll down until you find the following comment: # begin customizing here c. The S3 endpoints are defined below this line, so add your Cloud Storage host name to this list as follows: my @endpoints = ('<api_endpoint>', 's3.amazonaws.com', ... For example: #begin customizing here my @endpoints = ('cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com', 's3.amazonaws.com', ... d. Save the file. S3Curl is now ready to use. You can call it as follows: perl s3curl.pl --id UKCloud -- <curl_arguments> The curl_arguments need to contain the host name and port number. For example, to list your buckets, you could use: perl s3curl.pl --id UKCloud -- https://cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com/ Or to delete a file named Lighthouse.jpg in /bucket2 : perl s3curl.pl --id UKCloud -- -X DELETE https://cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com/bucket2/Lighthouse.jpg Using a command-line interface Interacting with Cloud Storage via the API directly is ideal for web-based applications, but having access from the command line can help developers with testing and provide scripting access to Cloud Storage. Command‑line interface (CLI) tools enable access from the command line by translating commands into the relevant API calls. There are lots of CLI tools to choose from; this article examines two for the S3 API: one for Linux and one for Windows. Using S3cmd (Linux CLI) S3cmd is an open-source tool for Linux, written in Python. To use S3cmd: Download and extract the S3cmd files from the following location: https://s3tools.org/download Create the required configuration files by running the following command: s3cmd --configure When prompted, provide the following information: Access Key - your User ID (you can find this in the Storage section of the UKCloud Portal) Secret Key - your secret key (if you've forgotten or don't know your secret key, you can reset it in the Storage section of the UKCloud Portal) Encryption password - create a secure password Path to GPG program - as appropriate for your system Use HTTPS protocol - yes You'll be prompted to test the connection. After the test, even if it fails, save the configuration, which will be written to ~/.s3cfg . Edit the ~/.s3cfg file and confirm that the host_base and host_bucket lines look like the following: host_base = <api_endpoint> host_bucket = %(bucket)s.<api_endpoint> Note Ensure that you use the appropriate api_endpoint , as shown in Before you begin , for example: host_base = cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com host_bucket = %(bucket)s.cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com Save the file.

    "keywords": "How to use file browsers with Cloud Storage Overview UKCloud's Cloud Storage service is an object storage solution based on Dell EMC Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS). Access is via a RESTful application programming interface (API). Web applications can easily interact with the API, but the ability to browse the contents of the storage using a graphical client can be useful, as it provides a user friendly interface to the storage. This enables, for example: Verification by developers that their applications or scripts work as intended with the storage Bulk import or export of content by users Easy maintenance and housekeeping of the objects in the storage system ECS provides an S3-compatible API that you can use to manage Cloud Storage. Note The ECS Atmos API has been deprecated, we therefore suggest customers re-engineer their solutions to make use of the defacto S3-compatible API. In this article, we'll look at a couple of the many applications that enable you to browse an object storage system. The inclusion of applications in this article should not be taken as an endorsement or recommendation of them by UKCloud. However, we have tested them with our Cloud Storage service and verified that they work correctly. A note about S3 browser extensions While there are S3 browser extensions available, none of them include the functionality to customise the server host name, which is a requirement for connecting to Cloud Storage. If we find S3 browser extensions that offer this functionality in the future, we'll update this article. API endpoints Cloud Storage provides different API endpoints to access your storage, depending on the UKCloud site and connectivity type you are using. Make sure you use the correct endpoint to ensure the best possible performance for your solution. S3 API endpoints: Corsham (Assured) Internet: cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com PSN Assured: cas.cor00005.psnassured.ukcloud.com HSCN: cas.cor00005.ukcloud.thirdparty.nhs.uk/ Farnborough (Assured) Internet: cas.frn00006.ukcloud.com PSN Assured: cas.frn00006.psnassured.ukcloud.com HSCN: cas.frn00006.ukcloud.thirdparty.nhs.uk/ Contact UKCloud support if you are unsure which endpoint to use. Cyberduck Cyberduck is an open source cross platform file browser for HTTP based object storage solutions. It utilises the S3 endpoints to establish connectivity with the ECS platform over HTTPS.

Full pricing with all options, including licensing and connectivity, is available in the UKCloud Pricing Guide . Cloud Storage uses a tiering pricing model. Used storage is calculated on a daily basis and the data for a month is collected, with the average consumption calculated and rounded up to the next whole number to provide the number of GiB consumed in a month. Cloud Storage is then charged per GiB per month based on the storage tier applicable to the average monthly consumption. When your storage consumption moves into the next tier, only the amount of storage above the previous tier threshold is charged at the lower price. Calculating the cost To establish your Cloud Storage pricing, follow these steps: Choose the security level your workload needs: STANDARD or ENHANCED. Choose the security domain your workload needs to use: the DDoS-protected, internet-connected Assured OFFICIAL domain or the non-internet facing Elevated OFFICIAL domain.

    "keywords": "Cloud Storage Service Scope About this document This document describes the boundaries of the Cloud Storage service, along with the division of responsibilities between UKCloud and the customer, to facilitate the provisioning and ongoing use of the service. About Cloud Storage Cloud Storage from UKCloud is a secure and highly adaptable storage platform designed to address a wide variety of use cases. As an object storage platform based on Dell EMC's Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS), it is natively optimised for cloud storage in terms of scale, resilience and accessibility. Service options Organisations can choose from two service levels: STANDARD - data is stored in a single named UK-sovereign data centre with data protection using erasure coding. This provides fault tolerance by storing three copies of the data across separate nodes, thus improving data durability. ENHANCED - data is stored in two UK-sovereign data centres, with a copy maintained in a primary named UK data centre and copied to a geographically remote UK data centre. This provides a greater degree of fault tolerance than the STANDARD service level by storing an additional copy of the data in a separate site. If you want more control and visibility of your disaster recovery solution, you can design your solution to write data independently to each data centre at our STANDARD service level, instead of using our ENHANCED service level. Full details of the available service options are outlined in the Service Definition . Service availability UKCloud platform availability is based on the service level you purchase. The service level agreement (SLA) for the STANDARD service level guarantees 99.95% availability. The ENHANCED service level SLA guarantees 99.99% availability. In the event of a site failure, there will be an outage to objects created on the failed site. UKCloud will bring these objects online in the other site within 15 minutes. You are entitled to claim Service Credits for outages to services that take you out of SLA. For more about how we calculate SLAs, see the SLA Definition . Service background We actively capacity-manage the cloud platform to ensure you have access to the resources you request. The UKCloud platform is designed using sites, regions and zones. The relationship between them is shown below: You can specify Farnborough or Corsham as the site where you would like to have your service provisioned. We will try to accommodate requests and will advise you if we are unable do so. We control the deployed versions of technology on the platform. This covers internal platform-supporting technologies, and any technology versions available to you. Platform management Users can access, manage and view their Cloud Storage service, in any of the following ways: APIs. You can use the ECS S3-compatible API. Refer to the EMC ECS Data Access Guide for more information on the features of the API. Note The ECS Atmos API has been deprecated, we therefore suggest customers re-engineer their solutions to make use of the defacto S3-compatible API Command Line Interface (CLI). CLI tools enable access from the command line by translating commands into the relevant API calls. Storage Gateways. These applications can interact with Cloud Storage via the native API on the back-end and translate it into a more traditional file or block storage protocol at the front-end, enabling a wide variety of use cases. For more information see How to install Dell EMC GeoDrive . UKCloud Portal. Contains information about the namespaces and users within your Cloud Storage environment, as well as a graphical representation of your storage consumption. For more information on the Portal functionality, see How to view Cloud Storage information in the UKCloud Portal . To create additional namespaces or users, you must raise a service request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. When requesting additional users, you can specify whether you want these users to have read-write or read-only permissions. Technology constraints We do not currently offer access as an Network File System (NFS) or a Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) enabled account or bucket. You cannot access the underlying infrastructure. This includes (but isn't limited to) the hardware and the ECS Portal. Protection You can protect against accidental deletion or modification of data by using retention policies or versioning. Retention policies add a layer of protection by preventing files from being modified or deleted for a specified period of time, making them best suited to static data. Retention policies cannot be applied at the object level -- these API requests will be rejected. Versioning can protect against accidental deletion and modification by keeping multiple variants of an object. When versioning is enabled, any operation that would have overwritten an object retains the old version of the object, enabling you to retrieve or restore to a previous version using the S3 API. Each version of an object will be billable for the storage it consumes, so you may want to implement versioning expiration policies to manage your storage footprint. Encryption at rest can be enabled when creating a new namespace or bucket. This encrypts data inline, using an AES 256-bit algorithm, before it is stored on drives. If you want your data to be encrypted at the namespace level, you must request this functionality before your namespace is created, as encryption cannot be enabled or disabled after a namespace is created. Networks Cloud Storage is available on a range of Assured and Elevated networks. An overview of the available networks in each region is available in UKCloud Services By Region . Cloud Storage in our Assured OFFICIAL domain uses the same environment for both PSN Assured and internet connections. Although it isn't possible to bridge between these connections, any objects placed in Cloud Storage via PSN Assured will also be accessible via the internet using the appropriate customer credentials. We manage the physical firewalls that face public and secure networks. Protective monitoring We have implemented GPG 13-aligned Protective Monitoring across the Assured and Elevated platforms at the perimeter of your estate. We don't provide Protective Monitoring services within your estate - it is your responsibility to act at this level. In line with UKCloud's SISP, we provide notification of customer-impacting security incidents. It is your responsibility to report similar incidents to us. Service migration You can request a migration through a Service Request. Migrations may be between: Services (for example, STANDARD to ENHANCED) UKCloud sites or availability zones The Assured and Elevated platforms Customer service Cloud Architect. UKCloud Cloud Architects support you during the design of solutions for the cloud platform. UKCloud Cloud Architects are ideally placed to help reconcile your requirements with the UKCloud platform. We recommend engagement with a Cloud Architect when implementing complex solutions. Service Delivery Manager (SDM). An assigned point of contact who will provide any assistance you require during your use of the service, including onboarding, service reviews and incident reporting and escalation. Support Desk. After the initial on-boarding and design phase, you can utilise the standard UKCloud support entitlement, which is documented in the Customer Engagement Factsheet . Customer responsibilities Assessing whether the UKCloud platform can support the various requirements of your application and storage needs. The control and management of access and responsibilities for end users including appropriate connectivity, security and accreditation if required. If access is required over government secure networks (HSCN, Janet, RLI or PSN), the customer is responsible for adhering to the relevant Code of Connection (CoCo) and for providing evidence of their CoCo to UKCloud upon request. UKCloud is unable to provide access to secure networks where such evidence has not been provided by the customer. The customer is also responsible for ensuring only lawful data that supports the UK public sector is stored and processed by applications on this environment, and that they fully comply with the UKCloud Security Operating Procedures (SyOPs) and other information assurance requirements as specified in the UKCloud System Interconnect and Security Policy (SISP) and associated accreditation documentation sets. Service provisioning Within 1 day of accepting an order (shorter deployment times are typically achieved and can be prioritised upon request), UKCloud will create the customer's Primary Administrator account and send a Welcome Pack which includes the URL for the UKCloud Customer Portal, and the getting started guide. The customer can then use these details to configure their application (for example GeoDrive, Cloud Tiering Appliance and Documentum) or access Cloud Storage via the API to begin using the service. UKCloud has created a number of videos, help guides, manuals and FAQs to help train and instruct users so that they are up and running quickly and easily. These are available within the Knowledge Centre, accessed via the UKCloud Portal. UKCloud also has a large ecosystem of partners who can deliver additional services, such as support and professional services.

    "keywords": "Cloud Storage Service Definition What is Cloud Storage? Cloud Storage is a secure and highly adaptable storage platform designed to address a wide variety of use cases. It's based on object storage technology, which is natively optimised for cloud storage in terms of scale, resilience and accessibility. Traditional storage solutions are typically characterised by large capital expenditure and an intensive management and support burden, and forever swing between under and over capacity. Cloud Storage benefits customers as there are no upfront costs and no minimum term commitments – customers merely pay for what they actually use, when they use it. What the service can help you achieve Release your existing Tier 1 storage capacity and avoid unnecessary storage costs by migrating valuable but seldom used data to a secure and cost-effective cloud storage repository Build modern, distributed architecture applications, leveraging the benefits of object storage Assure your data recovery – use it as a UK-based cloud backup target as an alternative to storing backups on unreliable tape media or expensive disk solutions Enhance the durability and availability of your personal data, replacing inflexible network drives with cloud storage that can be accessed by any device from any location Reduce the burden and complexity of managing the unpredictable capacity requirements of your organisation as we enter the era of big data Product options Cloud Storage provides data resilience using the Reed Solomon 12 + 4 erasure coding scheme. This splits objects into 12 data fragments and 4 coding fragments. These fragments are spread across multiple nodes in the data centre making the object recoverable from any of the 12 data fragments. This service is designed to be flexible and enables you to mix and match from a range of pre-defined options and change them when required.

    "title": "General connectivity FAQs",
    "keywords": "General connectivity FAQs What options do I have to connect to my solution hosted on the UKCloud Assured OFFICIAL security domain? The UKCloud Assured OFFICAL security domain is PSN accredited to host OFFICIAL data (including OFFICIAL SENSITIVE) that is accessible via the internet or the PSN service. You can also connect via internet, HSCN and Janet dependent on relevant accreditation. Our Assured OFFICAL security domain follows best commercial practice, so certain insecure traffic types are restricted. In general, it's good practice to connect to your Assured OFFICIAL solution via an IPsec VPN (using commercial-grade encryption), which you configure via your self-managed virtual firewall. Within the VPN tunnel, you can use any protocol, giving you maximum flexibility. You can also configure your solution to allow other traffic encrypted using SSL or TLS. Use of non-encrypted traffic should be minimised. As our Assured OFFICIAL security domain is PSN accredited, you can also connect to your solution via our resilient and scalable PSN service connections. Alternatively, you can use HybridConnect options by, for example, installing your own CAS(T)-compliant private circuit. Can I connect to my solution using SSL VPN? Our Assured OFFICAL and Elevated OFFICAL security domains both support SSL VPN (configured from within the edge gateway), but we do not recommend it other than for occasional remote administration purposes by a small number of administrators. If you need more extensive use of SSL VPN, we recommend you deploy a dedicated VPN appliance, such as OpenVPN. Can I use UKCloud as a transit or gateway between different connections? No. Our cloud platform is designed so that all traffic either originates or terminates within our platform. We can't facilitate routing between connections. If your solution needs to service users on different networks, this will need to be implemented, managed and accredited within your application or an authorised gateway service. Do you provide an SLA on internet/PSN/HSCN/Janet connectivity? We provide an SLA for availability of our core services such as UKCloud for VMware. We cannot provide an SLA on external services as they are outside our control. UKCloud can only provide assurance associated with the native SLAs that are offered as part of the core PSN framework. How is resiliency managed on external networks? Networks such as the internet and PSN, Janet and HSCN community networks are brought into UKCloud via diverse routes to ensure resilience of the connections. In the case of internet connectivity, we also use diverse supplier networks to ensure supplier resilience. Once within the UKCloud environment, we use Border Gateway Protocols (BGP) and our private inter-data centre fibre networks to triangulate the network connections. This means that in the event of an issue with one of the networks within a single data centre, we can reroute external connectivity via the second data centre. Why doesn't the UKCloud SLA extend to external connectivity such as PSN and the internet? The UKCloud SLA provides our customers with assurance that our platform is designed, engineered and operated to deliver high levels of availability and uptime. We've invested in skilled and experienced people, ISO 20000-certified IT service management processes and best-in-class technology - all of which underpin our cloud services and enable us to deliver high availability. When it comes to external connectivity, we depend on services provided by third parties. In some cases (such as PSN and Janet), we have no choice over which connectivity provider to work with, as this is mandated by the government framework. These services are available only as managed connections, so our SLA can only extend to the inside interface of the managed router deployed and maintained by the third party. Although we work closely with third-party providers to engineer a highly available solution, the actual delivery of the service is outside our control. For more open networks, such as the internet, we use multiple connectivity providers to further mitigate the impact of a service failure on the part an individual connectivity provider. Even so, failure scenarios can still occur beyond the UKCloud boundary, which can affect the service that customers receive (for example, congestion on the internet, localised failures within the provider's network or their peering agreement). What is your policy on IP addressing? We've designed our cloud to give you complete control and autonomy over the private ( RFC 1918 ) IP address space you deploy within your virtual data centre (VDC). You can use the self-managed virtual firewall to implement a VPN tunnel and network address translation (NAT) and load balancing to control how you publish the services within your VDC to external networks. For the UKCloud Assured OFFICIAL security domain, we allocate at least five usable RIPE IPv4 addresses , which are fully routable on the internet. With these addresses, you can establish: Source NAT - all outbound traffic to other resources on the internet will appear to come from one of these IPv4 addresses. Destination NAT - all inbound traffic from other resources on the internet must be targeted at one of these IPv4 addresses. You can translate the internet IPv4 address to an internal (RFC 1918) IP address assigned to a virtual machine (VM) or, preferably, to the edge gateway load balancer. A VPN - an IPsec VPN can be established between the IPv4 address of the virtual firewall and the IPv4 address of the firewall at another site. Once the VPN has been established, both sites can directly access the internal (RFC 1918) IP addresses. For PSN connections to either of our cloud platforms, the PSN Authority has provided us with a limited allocation of PSN IP addresses . The PSN Authority requires customers who need more than a few PSN IP addresses to use their own PSN IP allocation and, if more are needed, to justify an additional allocation directly with the PSN Authority. UKCloud will work with customers to facilitate the allocation of their PSN IP addresses to their services hosted on our cloud platform. With the PSN IP addresses, you can establish: Source NAT - all outbound traffic to other resources on the PSN will appear to come from one of these IPv4 addresses. Destination NAT - all inbound traffic from other resources on the PSN must be targeted at one of these IPv4 addresses. You can translate the PSN IPv4 address to an internal (RFC 1918) IP address assigned to a VM or, preferably, to the edge gateway load balancer. A VPN - an IPsec VPN can be established between the IPv4 address of the virtual firewall and the IPv4 address of the firewall at another site. Once the VPN has been established, both sites can directly access the internal (RFC 1918) IP addresses. As both PSN and RIPE IPv4 addresses are in short supply, you must use your addresses as efficiently as possible. Before additional IPv4 addresses can be allocated, you'll need to demonstrate your use of: Load balancing services - enabling a number of web servers to be accessed via a single externally routable IP address Host headers - enabling web servers to accept connections for a number of URLs via a single externally routable IP address VPN tunnelling - enabling the use of internal (RFC 1918) IP addresses for non-production services such as UAT and development Can additional purchased IP addresses be transferred to another VDC? As long as the original VDC is being removed, purchased IP addresses can be transferred to another VDC on the same account within the same region and zone. Other scenarios must be discussed with UKCloud. How do I remotely manage my solution hosted on UKCloud? Your cloud solution is designed to be self-managed via the UKCloud Portal or programmatically via a fully documented API. The Portal and API enable you to configure your VDC including the virtual firewall, load balancer, site-to-site VPNs, networks and VMs. You can deploy and manage operating systems and applications using the Portal's remote console function (Windows and Linux only). You can also configure your virtual firewall to allow direct remote management of each VM independent of the Portal or API, for example via IPsec VPNs or SSH. Using a VPN lets you connect directly to each VM using tools such as Remote Desktop, SSH or other management clients. When will UKCloud offer IPv6 addresses? The UKCloud core network supports IPv6 addressess at the internet layer using our own RIPE IPv6 range, which we advertise to all of our internet services providers. IPv6 deployments must be discussed with UKCloud. IPv6 is not yet available for any community network (such as PSN, Janet and HSCN). How are the two UKCloud data centres connected? UKCloud operates high-bandwidth (multi-Gigabit), low-latency (typically sub-5ms round-trip time) dark fibre connectivity between our two data centres, which is highly resilient as it takes diverse routes. This data centre interconnectivity is highly scalable, as spare fibre capacity is in place to meet future demand. It uses CAS(T) compliant circuits and, within our Elevated OFFICIAL security domain, we provide additional encryption overlay. These are PSN accredited to carry OFFICIAL data (including OFFICIAL SENSITIVE), as well as the PSN service. If I have reserved bandwidth, how do I uplift this? We actively monitor and manage our connections to ensure there is appropriate connectivity to the platform. Customers looking to provide guaranteed connection capacity should include a HybridConnect leased line in their solution. Can UKCloud help me if I don't have a suitable connection for the Elevated OFFICIAL security domain? We recognise that some customers may be affected by the often extended lead times associated with provisioning new connections suitable for the Elevated OFFICIAL security domain; and that some customers may not have adequate bandwidth to handle bulk import/export activities. To help address these issues, we offer two options: A chargeable Data Transfer Facility, enabling you to access the Elevated security domain and carry out import/export activities from our secure office. Although you can bring your data/media into our office and benefit from our readily available and suitably accredited connections to the Elevated OFFICIAL security domain, for large quantities of data we recommend the use of the Mass Transfer Facility A chargeable Mass Transfer Facility, enabling you to send in HDDs or a populated NAS box that can then be uploaded to your cloud environment. This is aimed at customers with large amounts of data to be uploaded, which can be performed by authorised UKCloud members of staff. If you're interested in either of these services, contact our sales team to discuss your requirements. How do I configure my solution to use the UKCloud data centre interconnection? This depends on the use case. If you have a VDC in each UKCloud data centre: Configure an IPsec VPN between the edge gateway instances of each VDC. Once the VPN has been established, VMs within the VDC can connect to each other using their private (RFC 1918) IP addresses. If you have VMs in one UKCloud data centre that need to access published services in the other (for example, VMs hosted in DC1 might choose to access Cloud Storage in DC2): The service (for example, Cloud Storage) will be published using an accessible hostname/IP address. The service should be published on standard ports (for example, HTTP). Configure your VMs to connect to the published hostname/IP over the standard ports. If your private circuits or co-located equipment need to use the data centre interconnection: Contact your account manager, as this will be a non-standard solution, which may require support from our technical specialists (costs will be as per the SFIA Rate Card ). Does UKCloud support RLI connections? Yes, UKCloud does support an RLI connection for customers who have been already authorised by the MOD. We'll then use the HybridConnect service to connect the RLI network to your cloud environment. If I have an MPLS circuit direct into UKCloud, do I still have to go through a PSN connection to access the Elevated Portal? No, you don't need a PSN connection as you can access the Portal from within a VM on the Elevated security domain. Are external Domain Name System (DNS) services available? No, we don't currently offer this service. Customers can implement their own DNS servers within their solution, or configure their virtual firewall to enable connectivity to an externally hosted DNS server (for example, those hosted on Government Secure Networks such as PSN, or those available on the internet such as Google 8.8.8.8). Does UKCloud support Janet connectivity? Yes, UKCloud provides Janet connectivity free for our customers. There is no inbound or outbound usage charge for using the Janet connection to access the UKCloud platform. To utilise this network, you'll need to be authorised by Jisc. For more information, see Requesting Janet connectivity to your UKCloud workloads . Is there a bandwidth restriction on a VRF? Like all our connectivity options, there is no set bandwidth cap on our VRFs, and we capacity manage our VRF network to ensure our customers can consume as much as required. However, we do operate a Networks Fair Use Policy to protect all our users from being impacted by spikes in unpredictable network traffic. To that end, if a customer believes that they'll use large amounts of bandwidth, we always appreciate a heads-up so we can proactively increase bandwidth of the network to avoid having to lean on any policy to protect other users. Outside of the VRF, customers may need to consider the impact of functionality, such as IPSec VPN tunnels over the VRF, that decrease the bandwidth of the network because of edge throughput limits.

    "keywords": "Neustar DDoS Protection from UKCloud FAQs What is Neustar DDoS Protection from UKCloud? Neustar DDoS Protection from UKCloud (previously SiteProtect Advanced DDoS Mitigation) is a fully-managed DDoS protection solution, backed by an industry-leading security operations team, that scrubs your website's malicious traffic to ensure only clean, legitimate traffic is delivered to your site. It's available in multiple deployment configurations to meet your needs and is flexible depending on your specific requirements. The cloud-based service mitigates attacks in the cloud, far away from your infrastructure, with the bandwidth and flexibility to repel today's largest attacks. Using proven methodologies, Neustar's experienced DDoS fighters intelligently match technology to threats, surgically derailing even the most complex attacks. The always-on hybrid managed solution removes the burden of DDoS with an on-site Arbor appliance for smaller DDoS attacks, combined with cloud-based failover for larger, sustained attacks. Remote management of monitoring, detecting and responding to DDoS attacks minimises downtime and frees your valuable resources. Who supplies the DDoS service? The Neustar DDoS Protection from UKCloud service is supplied and managed by Neustar. Who is Neustar? Founded in 1996, Neustar, Inc. (NYSE: NSR) is a trusted, neutral provider of real-time information and analysis to the internet, telecommunications, entertainment, advertising and marketing industries throughout the world. Neustar delivers real-time information and analytics for over 6 billion physical and virtual addresses, provides instantaneous answers to more than 27 billion queries from the internet each day, and answers over 300,000 questions every second. How is this different from standard UKCloud DDoS protection? Our standard DDoS protection is aimed at protecting all consumers on our cloud platform as a 'break glass' solution. It is a 'blunt instrument', as the counter-measures we deploy will primarily protect the community of users first and foremost, which may debilitate the customer who is being attacked. Although only public sector organisations use our cloud platform, there's a wide variety of uses, traffic types from different geographic locations, and varying traffic patterns and throughput. Because of these factors, we advise customers to consider DDoS protection that can be customised for their unique traffic and application use, to ensure uptime and minimise disruption. How is it set up? For internet-bound traffic, we manage an autonomous Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) service, which enables us to intelligently redirect traffic without affecting a customer's IP address allocation. Would the use of this DDoS service cause any disruption to live services? There should be no disruption during your move to the DDoS service, unless your applications are currently under attack. How do I make changes to my DDoS settings? Once the service has been provisioned, you'll receive access details for the customer portal. Via the portal you can supply all relevant information and adjust the settings of the service to suit your needs, expected traffic, and actions in the event of a suspected DDoS attack. How do I get support? Support is made available by Neustar directly. Is there a charge for this service? Yes, there's a one-off setup fee of £3,000, and a £5,000 per-month recurring charge, with a 12-month minimum-term contract. If we use SSL tunnels, will they terminate with Neustar? This depends on the whether they are BGP or DNS: BGP - tunnels - do not terminate at the customer server. DNS without SSL certificate - tunnels terminate at the customer server and Neustar uses SSL pass-through in the proxy. DNS with SSL certificate - tunnels terminate at the scrubbing location as Neustar holds the certificate. An additional tunnel is set up between the scrubbing centre and the server. Can pre-existing IP addresses be moved, or would new IP addresses be needed? This depends on whether they are BGP or DNS: BGP - existing IP addresses can be used. DNS - virtual IP addresses will be used when under mitigation. DNS redirect is done via a proxy so A records will need to be changed to move to the DDoS service.

    "title": "DDoS mitigation service FAQs",
    "keywords": "DDoS mitigation service FAQs What is UKCloud's approach to mitigating DDoS attacks? UKCloud has selected one of the leading providers of DDoS mitigation services and has implemented a hybrid solution. The service comprises both local DDoS mitigation appliances to mitigate smaller attacks, and the ability to leverage additional terabit scale global scrubbing centres if attacks threaten to exceed local capacity. This approach provides a balance between protection against DDoS attacks, without having some of the issues that are seen with an always-on solution (such as affecting legitimate traffic and VPN tunnels) or a manually invoked on-demand solution (where time to mitigate can be excessively long). This mitigation service enhances UKCloud's current ability to absorb small scale DDoS attacks by providing an additional layer of defence against larger and more complex volumetric DDoS attacks. UKCloud utilises a combination of specialist DDoS mitigation appliances hosted within our data centres and terabit scale scrubbing centres, which together implement a suite of DDoS countermeasures as appropriate. This, along with superior incident reporting, enables UKCloud to provide you with the details you need when reporting to GovCERT. You are advised to ensure that suitable application specific protection is in place to mitigate threats at the application layer, such as advanced persistent threats. For this purpose, you can procure an advanced DDoS mitigation solution. For more information, see Neustar DDoS Protection from UKCloud FAQs . DDoS mitigation services are expensive, will UKCloud be passing these costs onto customers? No. UKCloud is committed to continually investing in our platform to ensure that it delivers the highest levels of security, availability and scalability. We believe that customers should expect their cloud service providers to deliver increased value and lower prices over time, and this is just one example of how UKCloud demonstrates this belief to our customers and partners. What is the likelihood that legitimate traffic will be blocked by the DDoS mitigation service? This is commonly referred to as a 'false positive', where the DDoS mitigation technology incorrectly identifies legitimate traffic as an attack. Due to the nature of the UKCloud service, normal interactions between your application and end users will be no different from how they are today. In the event of the UKCloud hosted DDoS mitigation appliances identifying an abnormal traffic, our specialist DDoS mitigation partner will deploy appropriate countermeasures. Impact on legitimate traffic was a high priority consideration during our evaluation process and we are confident that the specialist provider of DDoS mitigation has appropriate controls across people, process and technology to make the likelihood of false positives almost zero. That said, if your system is subject to a sustained, high volume attack, UKCloud may choose to deploy specific countermeasures against the attacked IP address (and sometimes adjacent IP addresses), which would affect both the attack traffic and legitimate traffic to that specific IP address. UKCloud will use all reasonable endeavours to contact affected customers if we take this action. What additional latency will be incurred through UKCloud's use of the DDoS mitigation service? In normal operation (that is, traffic passing directly through UKCloud hosted DDoS mitigation appliances without requiring countermeasures), there is negligible additional latency to inbound or outbound traffic (rated at less than 80 microseconds). During a DDoS attack, there is negligible additional latency to outbound traffic, but inbound traffic will experience some additional latency, which will vary depending on the mitigation measure being taken. For example, when traffic is redirected through the specialist DDoS scrubbing centres, a sub-10 ms additional latency, caused by BGP routing, will affect inbound traffic to the scrubbing centre, and we expect there to be an additional 10ms latency affecting only traffic to the IP addresses under attack (incurred by DDoS mitigation technology within the scrubbing centre). So, customers targeted by the attack should experience additional inbound latency of about 20 ms, whereas all other customers should experience lower additional latency of sub-10 ms. What is the largest attack that the DDoS mitigation service can withstand? The specialist provider of DDoS mitigation is designed to withstand multiple simultaneous DDoS attacks. The service is continually being expanded in line with traffic volumes and the capacity of the scrubbing centres currently exceeds 1.5Tbit/s. The typical DDoS attack 1 is less than 2 Gbit/s but attacks of 50 to 60 Gbit/s are not uncommon and some attacks are beginning to exceed 100 Gbit/s. UKCloud subscribe to a tier of service designed to mitigate a specific level of attack. If the attack begins to exceed this level, UKCloud will work with the customer under attack and implement 'null routing' for the targeted IP address to ensure that all other customers continue to benefit from normal service. 1 https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/analyst/ddos-attacks-advancing-enduring-survey-34700 Does the DDoS mitigation service protect me against all types of 'denial of service' attacks? No. The service is designed to specifically neutralise the impact of highly distributed, volumetric, network layer attacks as these types of attacks most commonly cause 'collateral damage' and 'noisy neighbour' symptoms. The service is not designed to protect specific customers and applications against low-and-slow attacks, advanced persistent threats or application layer threats. Further, if your service is subject to a particularly high volume attack, it is possible that UKCloud will deploy specific countermeasures against your targeted IP address that could effectively make the IP address inaccessible to legitimate users of your service. To ensure you are protected against all types of denial of service attacks, UKCloud recommends that you consider mitigating these application specific threat vectors via appropriate solutions such as Web Application Firewalls, Content Delivery Networks, robust domain name services, and so on. For this purpose, you can procure an advanced DNS based DDoS mitigation solution. For more information, see Neustar DDoS Protection from UKCloud FAQs . What gives UKCloud the right to 'null route' traffic to my service? In common with most cloud service providers and hosting organisations, the Terms & Conditions (for example, G-Cloud Terms of Business) that all customers agree to as part of the provision of our services entitles UKCloud to suspend a customer's right to access or use all or any part of the services immediately upon notice to you if we determine that your use of the services: creates a security risk to the Services or any third party and / or may adversely impact the Services or the systems or Content of any other of our other Customers. Can I use my own DDoS mitigation service if I have more extensive requirements? Yes. UKCloud recommends that customers review their preparedness for DDoS attacks and other attacks such as advanced persistent threats and application layer threats. As an example, some customers choose to use a Content Delivery Network or DNS based DDoS mitigation service to provide additional protection against application layer and DNS layer attacks. Such a solution can absorb and mitigate customer specific attacks before the attack traffic hits the UKCloud platform. UKCloud customers are also able to procure an advanced DDoS mitigation solution. For more information, see Neustar DDoS Protection from UKCloud FAQs . Does the use of these third party DDoS mitigation services affect UKCloud's status as a PSN Accredited service provider? No. UKCloud consulted with NCSC and CERT-UK during our evaluation of the options. As it stands, traffic passed over the internet can be routed through various systems and countries by BGP, the native routing protocol of the internet. You are advised to ensure that your systems use appropriate encryption (for example, SSL, TLS or IPsec) to protect the confidentiality and integrity of your data. These same controls ensure security is maintained even when that data is passed through the scrubbing centres. As with many ISPs, the DDoS mitigation service is not provided by a UK sovereign organisation. Consistent with Principle 8 of the Data Protection Act, no citizen data is transferred to a non-EEA country; rather data packets may merely transit a specialist scrubbing centre located outside the EEA. If a DDoS attack results in a period of unavailability, will I be able to claim service credits? The UKCloud SLA protects you against the unavailability of the UKCloud platform to host your workload or data. A DDoS attack will typically only affect the availability of internet connectivity rather than the workloads and data itself. Due to the variable nature of internet connectivity, the UKCloud SLA does not cover these issues. So, if during a DDoS attack the UKCloud platform continues to run your workloads and provide your data then service credits will not apply. This is because your workload and data might still be available via non-internet connections such as PSN, leased lines, and so on. What reporting will I get as part of this service? If you experience a DDoS attack, you will be informed individually by UKCloud once the attack has been detected by the DDoS mitigation service. When the attack has ended, UKCloud will share a detailed report containing information on the size and duration of the attack, where the attack came from and the type of attack traffic detected (for example, ports and protocols).

    "title": "Emergency Services Network FAQs",
    "keywords": "Emergency Services Network FAQs What is the Emergency Services Network? The Emergency Services Network (ESN) is a network based on 4G that enables communications between emergency services, replacing the previously used radio-based system. Who is responsible for the ESN? EE are responsible for providing the 4G network and Motorola for providing all the equipment and data centres that are connected to the ESN. Vodafone are responsible for the provision of a Direct Network Service Provider (DNSP), the last-mile connectivity from the EE Points of Presence, each control room and every police, fire and ambulance station. How does the ESN work? The ESN shares the same networking space as commercial mobile traffic, however emergency services have a quality of service priority over EE's 4G network. During an emergency, EE prioritises emergency service traffic to allow for a better quality of service in the localised area of the emergency. Can UKCloud connect directly into the ESN? No. Motorola states there is no way to do this directly due to the levels of SLA needed on the network. Any connection to the ESN must be within the Motorola data centre and must go through a strict vetting process to be allowed onto the ESN. There is potential for us to connect indirectly in the future, however it would most likely be through the PSN or the DNSP. How can my application interface with blue-light organisations? Almost all blue-light applications will still connect to end-customers through normal government networks (PSN, HSCN) or internet (as this service is not replacing them), with the exception of specific applications which will be pushed to Motorola devices using ESN.

    "keywords": "HSCN connectivity FAQs General What is HSCN? The Health and Social Care Network (HSCN) is designed to provide a solution for hospitals, medical centres and GPs to collaborate and access services over a secure, high-speed network. It enables third-party software solutions to be presented to frontline patient care organisations. It's a government network like the Public Services Network (PSN), but specifically designed for the health and social care community. Can I use UKCloud's HSCN connection without using UKCloud's cloud services? No. We can provide a HSCN connection only to customers who use our cloud services. Can I use UKCloud's HSCN connection for my PoC on UKCloud's cloud services? Yes. If you are using UKCloud for a PoC and have signed up to the terms within the HSCN Connection Agreement, then we can grant you HSCN access for your PoC. Does UKCloud provide local connections to the HSCN network? No. We can't arrange HSCN connections to third party offices. We only enable our customers and partners to provide services via the HSCN, using applications and solutions hosted on the UKCloud cloud platform. Do you have any answers to general connectivity questions? You can find information about other connectivity methods and answers to general connectivity questions in the General connectivity FAQs . How do I get a HSCN connection from UKCloud? You must sign up to the terms of the HSCN Connection Agreement before you can have access to the HSCN: https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network/new-to-hscn/connecting-to-hscn If you think you have signed the Connection Agreement, go to https://crm.digital.nhs.uk/hscnconnectionagreementsearch/ and search either using your organisation name or ODS code (if you don't know your ODS code, you can find it at https://odsportal.digital.nhs.uk/ ). If you haven't yet received an invitation to complete your Connection Agreement, contact enquiries@nhsdigital.nhs.uk to request access to their online portal. Once you have access to the NHS Digital online portal, sign your Connection Agreement and submit it to NHS Digital. Alternatively, you can request a new UKCloud Master Services Agreement (MSA v11.0 or later), which contains the flow-down of the HSCN Connection Agreement terms. If you sign and submit this, you're automatically signing up to the terms of the Connection Agreement and do not need to sign a separate Connection Agreement with NHS Digital. If you'd like to sign the MSA, contact your Account Manager. UKCloud will validate that you've signed up to the terms of the HSCN Connection Agreement before connecting your UKCloud environments to HSCN. Why isn't my Connection Agreement showing up in the HSCN Connection Agreement Portal? You may find that, although you've signed the HSCN Connection Agreement, it doesn't show up in the HSCN Portal. If this happens you can either: Contact NHS Digial ( enquiries@nhsdigital.nhs.uk ) and ask them to update the Portal. When we can see your organisation agreement in the Portal we can give you HSCN access. For expediency, you can send a copy of your signed Agreement to us, and we can give you HSCN access straight away. We can then request that NHS Digital update their records for your organisation. What is UKCloud's ODS code? The UKCloud ODS code is 8J561. You can find all ODS codes at https://odsportal.digital.nhs.uk/ and connection agreements at https://crm.digital.nhs.uk/hscnconnectionagreementsearch/ . UKCloud are not on NHS Digital's CN-SP list, can you provide HSCN? UKCloud doesn't appear on the NHS Digital list of HSCN Consumer Network Service Providers (CN-SPs) as we are not a connectivity service provider in the same way as BT, Vodafone and Redcentric are, as we cannot provide 'cables in the ground' for consumers of HSCN. We're a Cloud Service Provider (CSP), which means we can allow customers to share our HSCN link as long as they have an ODS code, a valid DSP Toolkit, are signed up to the terms in the HSCN Connection Agreement and are consuming one of our value-add services, such as our UKCloud for VMware, UKCloud for OpenStack or Virtual Desktop services. We can provide more information about this on request. Service Can UKCloud accept dedicated HSCN connections? Yes. Our HybridConnect service option enables customers and partners to provide their own private circuits, including dedicated HSCN connections. If you want a dedicated HSCN connection to our cloud platform, our team can arrange for installation of dedicated HSCN circuits to each of our UK data centres. In these cases, you must complete a HSCN Connection Agreement before we can implement connectivity. What is the resilience of the UKCloud solution? The UKCloud assured cloud platform is connected to the HSCN in geographically diverse locations. In the unlikely event of a circuit failure, we'll continue to provide connectivity to the HSCN via our secure data centre interconnectivity and our secondary HSCN connection. How will I be billed? Billing for HSCN connectivity is monthly in arrears. Charges are included in your monthly invoice, along with charges for your UKCloud services. We charge for each UKCloud environment/service connected to HSCN, for example, each VMware compute service (vOrg) or each OpenStack project. Within each of these services, a customer may have multiple VDCs or routers that can connect to the HSCN. For example, a customer with a VMware compute service in UKCloud Region 5 and a VMware compute service and an OpenStack project in Region 6 wanting HSCN connected to all three of these services will be billed for three HSCN connections. If you have many environments that you want to connect to HSCN, you may find that our Unlimited option, which is a flat monthly fee, regardless of how many services are connected to HSCN, a more cost-effective based on your cloud architecture. UKCloud's HSCN pricing is available via the UKCloud Pricing Guide . Is there a minimum commitment period? UKCloud charges monthly for connectivity solutions, and requires a minimum commitment of one month for HSCN connectivity. Will I incur an upfront cost (setup fee)? Simple implementations of HSCN won't incur any additional setup or onboarding charges. For complex networking solutions, we reserve the right to charge SFIA rates. We'll always tell you in advance if an engagement will incur SFIA Rate Card charges. Does UKCloud provide data encryption? The HSCN is an unencrypted network and we don't provide additional data encryption. You must encrypt the data within your applications, especially personally identifiable data (PID), with an AES256 level of encryption. Can I use UKCloud's HSCN connected service if I'm based outside of England? IT Service Providers can use a share of UKCloud's HSCN connection from outside of England as long as they comply with the criteria specified in the NHS Digital guidance: https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network/hscn-technical-guidance/hscn-private-it-service-provider-connecting-from-outside-of-englands-borders-policy . This guidance does not apply to NHS organisations who would need to seek clarification from NHS Digital for their specific situation. Will I have full and unrestricted access to the entire HSCN network? You'll have unrestricted access to the HSCN but you may not be able to access any services presented onto HSCN until you've reached an agreement with the supplier of those services. Process Is UKCloud a HSCN Aggregator? UKCloud is a HSCN connected Cloud Service Provider and can give you a HSCN connection to environments on our cloud, however there is no longer an aggregation programme for HSCN. Once you're aligned with the HSCN Connection Agreement terms, either by signing your own agreement or by signing to UKCloud's terms, we'll connect you to our shared HSCN connection. How do I get a HSCN connected solution via the UKCloud assured cloud platform? You can get HSCN connectivity in one of two ways. Sign your own HSCN Connection Agreement. Sign up to UKCloud's MSA (version 11.0 onwards) as a consumer of our services and we cover you with the flow-down of the Connection Agreement terms. No need to get NHS Digital to counter-sign an Agreement. Do either of these and we'll enable your access to the HSCN and provide an appropriate HSCN IP address. How long does the Connection Agreement process take? If you get your own Connection Agreement, the time taken will depend on NHS Digital's speed of counter-signing your Connection Agreement. If you sign up to the Agreement flow-down through UKCloud's MSA then it only takes as long as it would for an order to be processed. We'll enable your connection to the HSCN within one working day of your successful completion of the assurance process. Do I need to contact NHS Digital to apply? If you want to sign your own Connection Agreement then yes, you do. However, you can be covered through the flow-down of the Agreement in UKCloud's MSA, in which case, you don't. We're an NHS organisation and already have an HSCN connection, can I use it to connect UKCloud's services? Yes. You'll need to provide us with your Connection Agreement and we can then provide you HSCN connectivity. You may also need to contact NHS Digital once you've been allocated an IP address to change any DNS records. We are a non-NHS customer who already have HSCN connectivity, can we use your HSCN-connected cloud services? Yes. Simply show us your Connection Agreement and we'll be able to connect your UKCloud service to the HSCN. You may also need to contact NHS Digital once you've been allocated an IP address to change any DNS records. I need a solution that's designed to face the HSCN and an additional network. Can UKCloud help? Yes. We can help with best practice advice on designing solutions that face multiple networks. It's important to ensure your design doesn't compromise any other networks or leave the possibility of unauthorised bridging. Usually, you'll need specific components of your solution to be dedicated to each network you want to use. Do I need an NHS sponsor to connect to UKCloud's HSCN? You don't need a sponsor to connect to HSCN, however you may need a sponsor to connect to HSCN-connected services such as Spine or Emis. Do I need to complete a Connection Agreement for each HSCN service I have on your cloud platform? No. you only need one signed Connection Agreement or UKCloud's terms and conditions to present multiple services to HSCN. However, you may need to create an accreditation pack for each individual service to present to the Information Accreditors who are looking at the security of your application before customers will procure it. Do you provide an SLA on HSCN connectivity? We provide an SLA for availability of our core services such as UKCloud for VMware. We cannot provide an SLA on external services (such as the HSCN) as they are outside our control. UKCloud can only provide assurance associated with the native SLAs that are offered as part of the core HSCN framework. How many HSCN IP addresses will I be allocated? You will be given one (1) useable IP address per HSCN edge/router. Any additional IP addresses will need to be justified and are an additional cost. You can be allocated up to 5 IP addresses per connection. If you require more than 5 IPs per connection you'll need to request additional IPs from NHS Digital, which we can advertise on your behalf. How do I justify the need for more IP addresses? As IPv4 addresses are in short supply, you must use your addresses as efficiently as possible. Before additional HSCN addresses can be allocated, you'll need to demonstrate your use of: Load balancing services - enabling several web servers to be accessed via a single externally routable IP address Host headers - enabling web servers to accept connections for several URLs via a single externally routable IP address VPN tunnelling - enabling the use of internal (RFC 1918) IP addresses for non-production services such as UAT and development Is there a cost for additional HSCN IP addresses? Yes. There is an administration fee of £20 for each additional HSCN IP address. How can I create an allow-list of source HSCN IP addresses on the edge gateway? You can log in to VMware Cloud Director via the UKCloud Portal and edit the firewall settings to allow or deny incoming connections from external IP addresses. See How to create firewall rules for more details. How does IP address allocation work on a HSCN network with two front-end servers? You can implement this in two ways: Create an external org VDC network in which UKCloud routes from the ASA firewall. This can then be used for NAT to the HSCN address. Use one of your public IP addresses, which is then translated (using NAT) on the ASA firewall. You can then use NAT rules on your edge gateway from an external org network as described in option 1. How does name resolution (DNS) happen on HSCN? There are two DNS servers on the HSCN network, which are looked after by the NHS Digital DNS team. UKCloud permits access (outbound) on UDP port 53 for DNS queries. To request a DNS change, email dnsteam@nhs.net , who require the following information: Domains that you want to change Old IP address(es) New IP address(es) Date and time of change We recommend a couple of days lead time as there may be scheduling issues, though these can be waived in emergencies. Please note that IP changes are not instantaneous and may take some time to propagate fully. We can perform out of hours changes for NHS customers.

    "title": "HybridConnect FAQs",
    "keywords": "HybridConnect FAQs What is HybridConnect? HybridConnect makes it easy for you to create hybrid clouds by securely connecting to the UKCloud assured cloud platform and supports a variety of flexible private connectivity options enabling hybrid topologies. These include connectivity to Crown Hosting facilities and to secure suites in UKCloud data centres, third-party data centres, at compatible cloud service providers, and in other customer data centre facilities. Available private connections include: CAS(T)-compliant circuits (leased lines and MPLS) with CPA-approved (or equivalent standard) overlay encryption CPA-approved (or equivalent standard) VPN solutions, which may be hosted for secure connectivity over the internet Secure fibre connectivity within UKCloud data centres Are there any specific requirements I need to consider? Yes. If you need to order connectivity from your premises, your provider needs to deliver the circuit to either Meet Me Room 1 or 2 (in SQ17 in our Corsham data centre and A9 in Farnborough). The provider also needs to deliver a fibre enabled router with LC connectors. You'll be set up with a 1G link as standard, however 10G is also available. Fibre runs between the data centres' Meet Me Rooms (MMRs) and the UKCloud suite will be protected using Kopex shielding. All connections are subject to available capacity. If my data centre is on the same campus as a UKCloud data centre, can I connect via direct fibre? Yes. NCSC recognises an intra-campus bonded fibre connection as being equivalent to CAS(T) and therefore appropriate for accessing the UKCloud Assured OFFICIAL cloud platform. CPA‑approved (or equivalent standard) overlay encryption should be used to make the fibre connection appropriate for accessing the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform. Fibre running between the data centres can be protected using Kopex shielding as an alternative. The cost of cabling between your data centre and our data centre is your responsibility, however we can help you arrange the installation with Ark. If my data centre is on the same campus as a UKCloud data centre, what type fibre do I need to order? If your data centre is in SQ17 Cosham or A9 Farnborough, then you need to place an order with Ark for multi-mode fibre with LC connectors. If your data centre is not in SQ17 or A9, single mode fibre needs to be installed with LC connectors. Ark will be able to supply both options. Can I install my own connectivity between UKCloud data centres? Yes. You can implement your own private circuit between our data centres, but it will be subject to costs, accreditation, configuration, support and lead times outside our control. We may charge you for hosting the private circuit equipment and for contributing to your design and implementation. Can I use UKCloud data centre interconnectivity (DCI) to 'triangulate' my private connectivity? Yes. You can deploy a private circuit into each data centre and use the UKCloud DCI to provide additional resilience. If the primary private circuit were to fail, you could get to the primary data centre (DC1) via the private circuit into the second data centre (DC2) and across the UKCloud DCI. In this case, you must use 'reserved bandwidth'. There may be setup costs (aligned to the SFIA Rate Card ), depending on the complexity of the requirement. How will HybridConnect connect to my UKCloud environment? The way that HybridConnect connects to your UKCloud environment depends on the region in which your environment is located and what kind of virtual firewall technology you use. You can discuss your options with your Solution Architect. How do I initiate and process a HybridConnect installation? You need to either contact your Client Director or raise a service request via My Calls in the UKCloud Portal. How much do you charge for a HybridConnect connection? There is a one‑off charge of £1,000 and then a monthly charge of £150 for a 1Gb port and £300 for a 10Gb port. Is there a minimum commit for HybridConnect? There is a minimum commit of 6 months for HybridConnect. In the case of early termination, you will be liable for any remaining balance.

The Law Enforcement Community Network (LECN) is a new network being created by the Home Office. This network will replace the PSN for Policing (PSNfP) network, which is going end-of-life around the end of 2021. When will the LECN be a live network? The LECN is being rolled-out during 2021 for existing services using the PSNfP. If you're already using the PSNfP, you should have been contacted by the Home Office to arrange a migration. Will UKCloud have connectivity to the LECN? We're currently working with the LECN team within Home Office to understand how the network will be presented to consumers so that we can enable connectivity that works in a way for the LECN service provider and our customers. At the current time, we're not yet sure exactly how we'll present the LECN to our customers, but as per the presentation of our existing networks, we'll aim to use either either multi-tenant (like our PSN connections) or individual connections (like our RLI connections). What compliance requirements will there be for access to LECN? The LECN doesn't have a compliance regime like PSN does. Compliance requirements will be driven by a specific service requirement, such as providing a service exclusively to UK policing, which requires connectivity to the network. The services themselves will have assurance requirements driven by UK policing assurance standards from the National Policing Information Risk Management Team (NPIRMT), so each connected service may have slightly different connection compliance requirements. What will the cost of access to LECN be? Cost will largely be dictated by the method of presentation of LECN to UKCloud, so we aren't sure at this moment. We'll update this article when we know more. I have a new service that I need to make available to policing right now, can I use LECN? If you have an immediate requirement to present a new service to the policing community, let us know and we'll work with you and the LECN team in the Home Office to understand the best way to get you connected to your policing end users. It could be that you'll need to use the PSNfP initially before migrating, depending on timescales of LECN rollout, but this will be defined by the Home Office.

The Public Services Network (PSN) is the government's high-performance network, which helps public sector organisations work together, reduce duplication and share resources. Who is entitled to connect to the PSN network? Any organisation that is approved by the PSN authority can connect. If you want PSN connectivity, you must have proven to the PSN authority that your infrastructure is sufficiently secure to connect to or be consumed via the PSN. This means that you must have successfully completed the process of obtaining a PSN Code of Connection (CoCo). In addition, if you're a partner selling a managed service over the PSN connectivity, you must either: Have your own PSN CoCo and PSN Code of Practice (CoP) in place, or Have specific agreement from the data‑owning end customer that you are authorised to be covered by the customer's CoCo You can find more details here .

You can apply for your PSN CoCo via the following links: PSN Service Provision Compliance Certificate PSN Connection Compliance Certificate How do I apply for a PSN CoP? You must have a CoCo before you can apply for a CoP and list the UKCloud Service Numbers in your application. For the current CoP application form, click here . You must have your CoP in place before we can accept your order. What are UKCloud's PSN service numbers? Click here for a list of our PSN approved services. What happened to PSN Assured and PSN Protected? Previously, PSN Assured carried non-encrypted traffic at the network and application layers, whereas PSN Protected carried traffic that contained a shared IPsec encrypted overlay. However PSN has now been flattened into one network as detailed in PSN flattening Do you have any general connectivity questions? You can find information about other connectivity methods and answers to general connectivity questions in the General Connectivity FAQs . Service Can I connect to your Elevated OFFICIAL security domain using the unencrypted PSN Assured Service? No. We currently support connectivity to the unencrypted PSN Assured Service via our Assured OFFICIAL cloud platform only. The PSN Assured Service is CAS(T) compliant and so suitable for some OFFICIAL data (previously IL2 data). Customers wanting to use the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform typically have more sensitive requirements related to the confidentiality and integrity of their data, and so are more likely to require the encrypted PSN Protected Service. Only the encrypted PSN Protected Service can connect to legacy IL3 networks such as GSI. Can I connect to the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform using a private encrypted PSN closed user group (CUG)? Yes, you can use HybridConnect to deploy your own PSN circuit and associated CUG. However, the PSN strongly prefers customers to connect to PSN Services (such as the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform) via the PSN Protected Service, which uses the IPED (Inter Provider Encryption Domain) to provide secure, encrypted connectivity independent of the underlying DNSP access connection. PSN CUGs are DNSP specific, and so potentially lock customers in, as these connections usually have minimum contract periods and other commercial barriers. Can I have a combination of government community networks and private accredited networks into the same UKCloud solution? Yes, subject to compliance with information assurance requirements, as only organisations that demonstrate compliance with the appropriate code of connections (for example PSN compliance certificate or HSCN Connection Agreement) can have access to government community networks. You should be careful not to misconfigure self‑managed components of the solution (OS, application) to 'bridge' between government community networks (PSN) and private networks. This concern must be addressed by accreditation of the customer-managed components - preferably via PSN Accreditation. Local departmental accreditation by a public-sector customer is also allowed. This applies to solutions on both our Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platforms. The UKCloud Assured OFFICIAL security domain features connectivity to the PSN Assured Service (previously IL2). This is provided via resilient, high‑capacity PSN circuits from Virgin Media installed into each of our data centres. The UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL security domain is connected to the encrypted PSN Protected Service (previously IL3) via the IPED. This is provided using circuits from Vodafone into each UKCloud data centre. The PSN Protected Service also provides onward connectivity to legacy government community networks such as PNN and CJX. For both PSN services, we use our data centre interconnects (DCI) to provide additional resilience through triangulation. How have you implemented your GSI connections? UKCloud uses Vodafone for connectivity to the encrypted PSN Protected Service into the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform. This connection uses the IPED to provide native connectivity to GSI and other legacy government community networks, including GSE, PNN and CJX. Scalable, resilient PSN Protected Service connections are installed into each of our data centres. We use our DCI to provide additional resilience through triangulation. Do you have an encrypted PSN Protected Service connection? Our Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform is connected to the encrypted PSN Protected Service (previously IL3) via the IPED. This is provided by circuits from Vodafone into each of our data centres. The PSN Protected Service also provides onward connectivity to other government community networks, such as GSI, GSE, PNN and CJX. How long is the lead time for provisioning PSN service into my solution? You request connectivity to the PSN by raising a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. We typically require two working days to provision the PSN service from receipt of an accepted request. If your solution requires many PSN IP addresses, we may need more time to work with you to get your PSN IP addresses configured to work with your solution hosted on our cloud platform. If you require additional PSN IP addresses , you'll need to request them from the PSN. Do you provide an SLA on PSN connectivity? We provide an SLA for availability of our core services such as UKCloud for VMware. We cannot provide an SLA on external services (such as PSN) as they are outside our control. UKCloud can only provide assurance associated with the native SLAs that are offered as part of the core PSN framework. What is your policy on IP addressing? We've designed our cloud to give you complete control and autonomy over the private ( RFC 1918 ) IP address space you deploy within your virtual data centre (VDC). You can use the self-managed virtual firewall to implement a VPN tunnel, network address translation (NAT) and load balancing to control how you publish the services within your VDC to external networks. For PSN connections to either of our security domains, the PSN has provided us with a limited allocation of PSN IP addresses . The PSN requires customers who need more than a few PSN IP addresses to use their own PSN IP allocation and, if more are needed, to justify an additional allocation directly with the PSN. We will work with you to facilitate the allocation of your PSN IP addresses to your services hosted on our cloud platforms. With the PSN IP addresses, you can establish: Source NAT - all outbound traffic to other resources on the PSN will appear to come from one of these IPv4 addresses. Destination NAT - all inbound traffic from other resources on the PSN must be targeted at one of these IPv4 addresses. You can translate the PSN IPv4 address to an internal (RFC 1918) IP address assigned to a VM or, preferably, to the edge gateway load balancer. A VPN - an IPsec VPN between the IPv4 address of the virtual firewall and the IPv4 address of the firewall at another site. Once the VPN has been established, both sites can directly access the internal (RFC 1918) IP addresses. Before additional IPv4 addresses can be allocated, you'll need to demonstrate your use of: Load balancing services - enabling several web servers to be accessed via a single externally routable IP address Host headers - enabling web servers to accept connections for several URLs via a single externally routable IP address VPN tunnelling - enabling the use of internal (RFC 1918) IP addresses for non‑production services such as UAT and development Is the PSN connection into UKCloud shared by all environments connected to the PSN? PSN is a shared connection and all UKCloud PSN‑enabled customers use a shared bandwidth model. Does each PSN connection have a maximum bandwidth limit assigned to it? We don't publish limits associated with PSN bandwidth as we capacity manage the link to ensure there is always enough bandwidth for our customers. Consumption of PSN bandwidth is based on the actual volume of data transferred (outbound) per month. What is the notice period for PSN termination? The notice period for PSN termination is 30 days. How do I make DNS changes? You'll need to complete the PSN DNS order form, PSN domain name authorisation request form and the PSN customer change form. You can find these forms at: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/psn-dns-change-forms You then need to submit the completed forms to: frameworkschange@vodafone.com If you don't have an existing contract with Vodafone, a billing account and remedy name will need to be created. How do I order PSN connectivity? When placing an order through your Client Director or when raising a service request, you need to provide evidence of your entitlement to connect to the PSN. You will also need to provide updated PSN approval when your certificate expires. How will I be billed for PSN? Billing for PSN is monthly in arrears. Charges are included in your monthly invoice, along with charges for your UKCloud services. Changes depend on whether you're on PSN Assured or PSN Protected and whether you have selected the unmetered data transfer option: If you're on PSN Assured, you'll be charged for outbound data used in the month once you have exceeded 1TB. If you're on PSN Protected, you'll be charged a monthly starter pack fee for the outbound data used which provides 250GB per month. Additional usage will be charged as per the UKCloud Pricing Guide . For either service, if you have the Unmetered Data Transfer option, you'll be charged a set fee for the month. We charge for each separate connection on the UKCloud platform. UKCloud pricing is available via the UKCloud Pricing Guide . How does PSN for Policing work? Cryptographic overlays on top of the PSN network are created that prevent PSN customers from seeing the closed Police network. See the PSN for Policing and enhanced regime FAQs . Please engage with a UKCloud Cloud Architect for more details. What is the suggested Maximum Transition Unit (MTU) for PSN? We suggest an MTU size of 1400 bytes for further information. For more information, see this DDoS mitigation causing VPN failures and slow applications . What PSN Code of Connection (CoCo) do I need to get PSN connectivity on UKCloud? The guidance from PSN Authority is as follows: The PSN CoCo from non-government organisations is called the PSN Service Provision Compliance Certificate. This certificate is the one that is relevant to workloads facing PSN -- there are other PSN CoCos, however are not applicable for non-government organisations. You can present us with one of two CoCos. If you present us with a PSN Service Provision Compliance Certificate then it needs to be applicable to that project or a blanket Service Provision Compliance Certificate, covering many projects that you are doing. The other PSN CoCo, PSN Connection Compliance Certificate , allows the access to connect to PSN to send and receive data from services on it, including creating PSN-connected environments for yourselves on UKCloud. I am a government organisation, what do I need to show you to get PSN connectivity for my UKCloud environment? You must do one of the following: Supply us with a project specific PSN Service Provision Compliance Certificate Supply us with a blanket PSN Service Provision Compliance Certificate that covers all projects you are doing Supply us with a PSN Connection Compliance Certificate, validating that you are connected to PSN I am a non-government organisation but I am supplying a service to a single government organisation. What do I need to show you to get PSN connectivity to my environment? If the government customer is supplying the CoCo, this must be a blanket or project specific PSN Service Provision Compliance Certificate, covering all projects that the government organisation is doing and we must see a statement from the government organisation's SIRO/IA with confirmation to use their CoCo. If the government customer is not supplying them with the CoCo, they will need to apply for a PSN Service Provision Compliance Certificate for themselves. A PSN Connection Compliance Certificate is not an acceptable CoCo. I am a non-government organisation providing a service to multiple government organisations. What do I need to show you to get PSN connectivity to my environment? You will need a PSN Service Provision Compliance Certificate for your organisation. Can I take my assigned PSN IPs with me if I ever migrate away from UKCloud? No, the PSN IPs we have are assigned to UKCloud by the PSN Authority so they are not transferrable. If you apply for your own range of IPs from the PSN Authority, then we can advertise these on your behalf, allowing you to own these IPs and move them if you wish. Can I bring my own PSN IPs to UKCloud? Yes, if you want to bring your own IPs then we can advertise them on your behalf. These are available from the PSN authority. For solutions requiring many PSN IPs we would encourage you to bring your own range.

    "title": "PSN for Policing and enhanced regime FAQs",
    "keywords": "PSN for Policing and enhanced regime FAQs What is PSN for Policing? The Public Services Network for Policing is a closed user group (CUG) operated by Vodafone over the PSN, using cryptographic overlays, connecting all UK police forces. Supplier CUGs are also available. What is the Enhanced Regime? The Enhanced Regime is sometimes referred to as the PSN in Policing (Protect), which is a set of controls over and above the encryption that is run on parts of the PSN that were PSN Protected (PSN-P) when it was a separate network to PSN Assured (PSN-A). It's generally used to exchange data between police and non-police organisations. Why are there two policing networks? Legacy PSN-P was based on the Inter-Provider Encryption Domain (IPED) to enable multiple DNSPs to provide competition. Since the merge of PSN-A and PSN-P this IPED still exists with those connections that were PSN-P before the flattening, however the downside of IPED is that it introduces latency issues and throughput concerns. There were also a lot of non-police organisations on the PSN-P so police had less trust of this community. Due to this, non-police organisations use the PSN-P with additional controls (Enhanced Regime), as this is easier to consume, but police use the CUG over the PSN (PSN for Policing). Can data get between the PSN for Policing CUG and the Enhanced Regime? Yes. There are gateways, external to UKCloud that allow data to traverse the two networks. This is managed and controlled by Vodafone. For questions relating to this gateway please contact Vodafone or the PSN for Policing Authority. How do I get on the PSN for Policing or the Enhanced Regime? You will need to contact the PSN for Policing Information Assurance team: ( information.assurance@homeoffice.pnn.police.uk ) The first stage is for Policing to confirm that there is a business requirement for the organisation (organisation/system/service) to connect to policing - so partners need a sponsoring force or department. Secondly it will be confirmed about how they should connect to Police. Then it should be confirmed that the supplier meets the necessary IA requirements. Design docs / RMADs / Code of Connection templates should be sent to the IA team - they review and then pass to GDS for approval. The supplier will then be granted code of connection by the PSN for Policing IA team. The supplier will need to liaise with UKCloud, Vodafone and the Home Office to get connectivity to the relevant network, as directed by the PSN for Policing Authority. Can I connect directly to the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL platform using a PSN for Policing CUG? Yes. The PSN for Policing the connection will be installed as a private circuit into UKCloud, provided and managed by Vodafone. This means it can be terminated in the Elevated Cloud platform. Please see our HybridConnect FAQs for more information around connecting your own line into the UKCloud platform. Can I connect directly to the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL platform using the Enhanced Regime? Yes. The Enhanced Regime is a set of additional controls over what was the PSN-P, which terminates in the Elevated platform. Can I connect directly to the UKCloud Assured OFFICIAL platform using a PSN for Policing CUG? Yes. As the connection is installed as a private circuit into UKCloud, provided and managed by Vodafone, you can terminate it into the Assured Official platform. It's worth remembering that the PSN for Policing Authority may influence where this connection is terminated. Can I have a combination of government community networks and private accredited networks into the same UKCloud solution, including the PSN for Policing networks? Yes, subject to compliance with information assurance requirements, as only organisations that demonstrate compliance with the appropriate code of connection (for example PSN compliance certificate or HSCN Connection Agreement) can have access to government community networks. You should be careful not to misconfigure self-managed components of the solution (OS, application) to 'bridge' between government community networks (PSN) and private networks. This concern must be addressed by accreditation of the customer-managed components - preferably via PSN Accreditation. Local departmental accreditation by a public-sector customer is also allowed. This applies to solutions on both our Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platforms. What if I have been given some IPs for connection to the Enhanced Regime? You'll need to liaise with Vodafone to ensure that these IPs are associated with your service within UKCloud. You may be asked by Vodafone for your circuit reference numbers. Raise a service request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal to obtain these. You'll then need to have these IPs added to your accounts. You can do this via a service request. UKCloud may need to work with Vodafone to advertise these IPs, which can take up to 10 days to facilitate. Once complete, you'll then be able to provide your service over the new IPs. Can I swap out my existing PSN IPs for Enhanced Regime IPs? Yes. The process is the same as above except there may be an element of disruption to the service as the IP addresses are exchanged. You should liaise with UKCloud to find a suitable time to do this, to minimise any disruption. How do I get PSN for Policing or Enhanced Regime IP addresses? If you are connected to a PSN for Policing CUG, you'll be provided with an IP range by Vodafone. If you are connected to the Enhanced Regime, you'll be provided an IP range by Home Office. You'll need to raise a service request with us via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal to have these IPs added to the UKCloud firewalls. This may have a lead time of a few days. How long is the lead time to get a PSN for Policing network connected to my solution? This varies depending on the solution and the network you want to connect to. It will take time to gain the accreditation needed through the PSN for Policing Authority. There will then be a lead time to get the connectivity provisioned into your solution. When connecting to a PSN for Policing CUG, you'll need to wait for Vodafone to provision the connectivity into the UKCloud data centres. Because of this you'll need to factor in an extended lead time. When connecting to the Enhanced Regime you'll need to obtain IPs from the Home Office and have them made available to your solution by UKCloud. This will have a shorter lead time to implement that a CUG network, however it may still take a few weeks to do. How much does the PSN for Policing networks cost? The PSN for Policing CUG will be provided by Vodafone as a single-tenant installation so will be treated as a leased line. There will be Vodafone charges for this service that are outside of UKCloud's control. UKCloud will treat this as a HybridConnect service and will bill accordingly. For more information, see the HybridConnect FAQs . The Enhanced Regime has additional controls over the PSN and as such customers will be billed in accordance with PSN pricing.

    "title": "DDoS mitigation causing VPN failures and slow applications",
    "keywords": "DDoS mitigation causing VPN failures and slow applications Overview UKCloud utilises a hybrid solution Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) mitigation service to help protect customers against DDoS attacks. The hybrid service comprises local DDoS mitigation appliances to mitigate smaller attacks, failing over to the cloud if attacks exceed local capacity. For more information on this specific service, see DDoS mitigation service FAQ . Issue Although DDoS mitigation is a valuable service, there are some considerations to be aware of that could impact your environment if not accounted for, for example by causing VPN failures or slow applications. These may not be apparent in normal local operation of the DDoS service, but only come to light when larger attacks are mitigated via the cloud. This is because, during cloud mitigation, traffic is tunnelled from our supplier to UKCloud, adding IP overhead. This could potentially cause packet fragmentation, resulting in the issues mentioned above. Recommendation To avoid issues related to fragmentation, UKCloud recommends the following settings/protocols: MTU - As a proactive measure, adjust the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) settings of your IPsec VPN connection from the default (~1500) to a fixed value between 1350 and 1426. You can do this using the VMware Cloud Director GUI or by using the vCloud API (for more information, see How to configure IPsec VPN (GUI) or How to change IPSEC VPN settings via the vCloud API ). IKE - UKCloud recommends using IKEv2, which supports fragmentation. Authentication method - If using certificate-based VPNs, UKCloud recommends using ECDSA over RSA. ECDSA signatures are smaller (avoiding fragmentation) and computationally more efficient. If you're still experiencing connection issues, raise a support request via the UKCloud Portal. Explanation MTU is the maximum size of data that can be sent in a single frame. It's typically set at the data link layer by the Ethernet protocol. Most devices have a default MTU size of 1500 bytes. IP facilitates delivery across networks using IP datagrams (which encapsulate the TCP or UDP message). IP datagrams can accommodate different MTU sizes, for example, by fragmenting a datagram that is larger than the MTU into smaller packages that can then be forwarded. However, some applications may set a DF (Do not Fragment) bit, meaning that the datagram cannot be fragmented. If these packets are larger than the MTU, they are dropped. Fragmented packets add extra overhead and can cause delay as they need to be broken up and reassembled. Also, if just one packet of the fragmented datagram is lost, the entire datagram must be retransmitted.

    "title": "Protection for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks",
    "keywords": "Protection for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks Overview The UKCloud platform is designed to support and enable the government digital strategy and hosts citizen-facing solutions for a number of government departments. Some of these high-profile solutions inevitably attract undesirable attention from malicious actors. Unfortunately, if these malicious actors launch a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) ^ attack of sufficient size, it's possible to overwhelm the capacity of the UKCloud internet connections and affect the ability for users to access other internet facing systems (including those not specifically targeted by the attack). We protect the underlying internet-facing infrastructure used by all customers by focusing on mitigating broad, high-volume attacks, which are most likely to cause collateral damage and noisy neighbour characteristics. For mitigation of low-level application-specific attacks or advanced persistent threats, you should consider implementing additional customer-specific and customer-managed mitigation solutions, such as those provided by Neustar DDoS Protection from UKCloud ). ^ Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is a specific type of attack designed to cause the target system to become unavailable. Specifically, this type of attack is highly distributed as the attack traffic comes from a diverse global network of attackers. This is similar to the analogy 'death by a thousand daggers'. UKCloud implementation for DDoS mitigation We've selected one of the leading global providers of DDoS mitigation services, which provides specialist DDoS mitigation capabilities to the largest online organisations worldwide. The service includes an array of DDoS mitigation technologies and specialist security analysts who operate a 24x7 security operations centre. This enables DDoS attacks to be detected and mitigated typically within five minutes. If your system is the target of a DDoS attack, we'll notify you individually and work with you to provide the necessary information about the attack to submit into CERT-UK and GovCERT. How it works We use the internet standard routing protocol BGP (border gateway protocol) to advertise preferred routes for our entire public IP address space to travel directly into our cloud platform via our multiple Tier 1 ISP connections. This ensures that all inbound traffic destined to workloads hosted on the UKCloud platform has a direct route into our platform and is not subjected to increased latency or additional network hops. Our Tier 1 ISPs pass traffic directly into specialist DDoS mitigation appliances (Netscout), which are hosted within each of the UKCloud data centres. Our local DDoS mitigation appliances are operated by our DDoS mitigation partner and so benefit from specialist 24x7 monitoring and management. All inbound traffic is inspected by the DDoS mitigation appliances, providing a first line of countermeasures and automatically signalling our DDoS mitigation partner. This configuration enables the DDoS mitigation partner to automatically and immediately detect when an attack is being mounted and implement appropriate countermeasures, including redirecting traffic through their terabit-scale scrubbing centres, as appropriate. These solutions typically begin mitigating DDoS attacks within five to ten minutes. All inbound traffic is routed directly to UKCloud via BGP and passes through our onsite DDoS mitigation appliances. The UKCloud DDoS mitigation appliances automatically alert our DDoS mitigation partner, who have specialist engineers, processes and additional DDoS-mitigation technology to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks. Under attack conditions, traffic is re-routed via terabit-scale DDoS scrubbing centres. Workloads on the UKCloud platform are protected from DDoS traffic. They only receive clean traffic and so the impact of the DDoS attack is contained. DDoS attacks can be extremely sophisticated in nature and there may be a dependency for the DDoS solution to be tuned based on the type and volume of the attack. This tuning process can be performed only during the attack and while the attack type is identified. In some cases, this may require customer co-operation and assistance. Risks and considerations It's important to note that the protection that we've implemented is designed to defend the community of our customers rather than any individual customer. We're able to mitigate volumetric network level DDoS attacks that not only affect the target solution, but many other internet-connected solutions too (this is sometimes referred to as noisy neighbour or collateral damage). Hence, during a sustained volumetric attack, the solution is designed to provide cleansing to ensure legitimate users can continue to access the application or service. The solution is not designed to provide a comprehensive security solution for a specific application or service. This is important to understand because if your application or service needs to remain available regardless of the size of the DDoS attack, then an additional, application-tuned DDoS service will be required. Further, it should be noted that volumetric DDoS attacks are often used as a smokescreen for more targeted low-and-slow attacks and advanced persistent threats (APT) that exploit application vulnerabilities higher up the stack (for example, Layer 7 exploits such as cross-site scripting). We recommend that customers consider mitigating these application specific threat vectors via appropriate solutions such as Web Application Firewalls, Content Delivery Networks, robust domain name services, on so on. UKCloud customers can also procure an advanced DDoS mitigation solution (for more information, see the Neustar DDoS Protection from UKCloud Service Scope ).

    "title": "HSCN and SSL certificates",
    "keywords": "HSCN and SSL certificates Overview This article outlines how you can get SSL certificates for web services hosted on HSCN. Domain names Before you can get SSL certificates for your web site, you must get a domain name that you can use on the HSCN. This can come in two forms: nhs.uk domain non nhs.uk domain nhs.uk domain Typically nhs.uk domains are reserved for NHS organisations only, however in some circumstances these may be successfully applied for by private organisations. There is guidance available about domain namespace policy available at https://digital.nhs.uk/services/networking-addressing/namespace-policy . You should apply for an nhs.uk domain by emailing the NHS DNS Team ( dnsteam@nhs.net ). If you have an nhs.uk domain name, you'll get a subdomain on the HSCN internal DNS service with a suitable A record. Non nhs.uk domain If you don't have an nhs.uk domain name, you may use your own domain name that has been adapted for use on HSCN. For example, if you don't already have a domain then you can create the internet domain of example.org then purchase an internet-based DNS service and create an A record in the DNS that maps to your HSCN IP address, for example, hscn.example.org maps to HSCN.IP.x.x . Getting SSL certificates When you have set up your domain, you can then get an SSL certificate. Go to a certificate provider, for example, Comodo or GoDaddy, and go through the validation process. Generally, this involves validation against emails to the specific domain you want to get a certificate for, for example, hostmaster@example.nhs.uk or administrator@example.org , though this process differs between providers. You should also decide what type of certificate you want, and this will affect the validation process. If you're unable to validate against an email address, then you should talk to your supplier about other methods of validation. Neither UKCloud nor NHS Digital provide SSL certificates and neither have preferred suppliers for SSL certs. Installing SSL certificates You are responsible for the installation of the SSL certificates in the appropriate place(s), for example, load balancers, SSL offloaders or web servers, by whoever administers the web site.

Gaining access to the gateway To gain access to the gateway, raise a service request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal containing the following information: Business justification of the requirement The NFT or IP address(es) from which the requests will originate Details of the target for the request (including the full URLs and HTTP methods) HTTPS access is allowed, but the content must be decrypted so that it can be inspected. When a new client is provisioned, you'll be issued with the proxy RootCA certificate, which you need to install in your trusted root authority certificate store. The individual ProxyCA certificates can then be trusted by your application. Business justification review If internet access via the gateway is part of a Cross Domain Security Zone (CDSZ) submission, sign-off authorisation for it is given through the UKCloud assurance wrap process. For an individual request that isn't related to a CDSZ submission, we follow the steps below for sign off: We review the service request to see whether it overlaps with any previously approved requests. We carry out a review to see if the request types fall within the recommended criteria. We make a recommendation to the UKCloud Compliance team detailing whether the request should be approved or rejected. Compliance will approve as a checkpoint. If the business justification is unclear, we may seek validation with the NCSC.

    "keywords": "Internet - permitted standard ports in regions 1 and 2 Overview For UKCloud regions 1 and 2, we consulted with NCSC and the Pan Government Accreditor and agreed a policy to maintain an allow-list of common ports that are open as standard on the platform, and allow interoperability between tenants in accordance with this allow-list. You still need to enable access on your own edge gateway firewall to allow access, but this avoids having to request UKCloud to make similar changes. Note In regions 5, 6, 13 and 14, there is no allow-list of common ports: all ports are open. The security of your estate is your responsibility and we highly recommend that you review your edge gateway configuration, regardless of the region in which it is located, to verify that the access controls in place are in accordance with your own required security policy. We also recommend that you do not disable your firewall, even in test environments. This allow-list policy applies to the Assured OFFICIAL security domain only, where connectivity is established using internet routable addresses and where access is to and from the internet or other customers on the UKCloud platform. Other allow-lists are maintained for other connectivity types. If you require access outside of the standard allow-list, you can request this via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal.

Note Currently, to change the adapter type, you'll need to navigate to the Legacy UI. To do this, in the top-right corner of the VMware Cloud Director tenant portal, click your user name, then select Legacy UI . There are a couple of things you should be aware of when doing this: Guest customisation - depending on the settings for each VM, this may cause the server to change its SID.

Policy scope The networks fair use policy includes: Private networks within UKCloud External networks that UKCloud is providing shared use of for the purposes of data transfer, including, but not limited to, internet, Janet, PSN and HSCN. Policy statements Applications of this policy: The networks fair use policy ensures that all customers who choose a shared network connection get a fair share of the use of that resource, and that no customer is disadvantaged by the conduct of others. The networks fair use policy ensures that UKCloud can monitor network usage and ensure that customers do not excessively use network bandwidth to the detriment of other customers. UKCloud has the right to vary the terms of this networks fair use policy at UKCloud's sole discretion. UKCloud may rely on its networks fair use policy where any customer's usage of the service is deemed to be causing disruption to other customers using the same shared network. Where UKCloud identifies a customer who persistently exceeds their fair share of network bandwidth, we will contact them and work with them to identify ways to more fairly utilise the resource or a more appropriate product or service level for their requirements. If a customer's network usage remains at a level that is disrupting other customers, UKCloud reserves the right to apply a Quality of Service network policy to limit network usage and ensure that fair use is maintained for all customers. This policy is supplementary to customer obligations outlined in UKCloud's Master Services Agreement (MSA).

    "keywords": "Understanding PSN core services Overview This document outlines the responsibilities between you and UKCloud with regards to Public Services Network (PSN) core services, such as DNS. The intended audience is organisations who are either consuming or presenting a service over the PSN --- both PSN Assured and PSN Protected. To be connected to the PSN, you must have a PSN compliance certificate. For more information, see https://www.gov.uk/guidance/public-services-network-psn-compliance . In this article, we use PSN to represent both PSN Protected and PSN Assured unless otherwise specified. PSN core services While you can procure PSN connectivity from multiple service providers, PSN core services are provided by Vodafone (gateways) and Nominet (DNS). Traditionally, this was through the GSI Convergence Framework (GCF), whereby all core services were bundled into a single contract, regardless of whether you used them all. Core services include: DNS Gateways to other networks, both government and public UKCloud has procured PSN connectivity on your behalf, giving you access to the PSN through a shared bandwidth model. We'll supply you with PSN IP addresses, enabling you to present and consume services over the PSN. PSN connectivity does not grant you access to PSN core services. Access to these must be purchased as a separate contract with Vodafone, and is available through Government Digital Marketplace (G-Cloud) or via Direct Award through the Network Services Framework with Vodafone. If you are a commercial organisation then you can take a contract out directly with Vodafone or Nominet for core services. Making changes to PSN core services When you have a contract with Vodafone or Nominet for PSN core services, you can add and change these to suit your service. To add or change the core services, complete the appropriate forms and send them to Vodafone or Nominet for approval to raise a change. Depending on the contract you have with Vodafone or Nominet , you will need to raise these changes differently. GCF contract customers If you have a GCF contract still in place with Vodafone, complete and submit the GCF change form: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gcf-customer-change-form For DNS changes a ticket should be raised with Nominet: https://nominetpsn.atlassian.net G-Cloud, direct award or commercial contract customers If you have contracted through G-Cloud, have been directly awarded a contract or have a commercial contract with Vodafone, complete and submit the PSN change forms: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/psn-dns-change-forms Responsibilities When completing the change forms, it's important that you complete the correct forms and that they are submitted by the correct people. As per GDS guidance, requests for new PSN domain names must be accompanied by the PSN domain name authorisation form. This needs to be completed by the domain contract owner. All requests for changes to the core services must come from the core service contract owner. If anyone else requests changes then they will be referred to the contract owner, which could cause a delay. Customer responsibility When you're given PSN connectivity by UKCloud, we'll provide you with all the IP information you require to submit a PSN core service change request to Vodafone or Nominet. You are responsible for the creation of domain names and additional information that may need to be submitted in the change form. You are responsible for completing and submitting the PSN core service change forms. UKCloud's responsibility UKCloud has no responsibility for facilitating a contract between Vodafone or Nominet and our customers or partners for PSN core services. You must approach and contract with Vodafone or Nominet directly. UKCloud has no responsibility for completing or submitting any change forms for changes to PSN core services on behalf of customers or partners. We may help you complete the form but you are ultimately responsible for validating and submitting the forms. UKCloud does not accept responsibility for incorrect information supplied within the change forms. Complex responsibility In certain circumstances, there may be complex aspects to responsibility: Scenario 1 - If a non-government organisation has not got a direct contract with Vodafone or Nominet, but is contracted through a managed service provider, then responsibilities may be shared between the organisation and MSP. Both parties may need to complete the form, however as per GDS guidance, it is ultimately the domain contract owner who owns the validation and submission of the forms. The domain contract should sit with the non-government organisation and not the managed service provider. Scenario 2 - If a non-government organisation is currently hosted on a different hosting provider, and is thinking about moving to UKCloud, then they need to consider their current contracting relationship for core services with Vodafone or Nominet. If the non-government organisation has no direct contract with Vodafone or Nominet but is contracted through the hosting provider, then when they move to UKCloud they may need to take out a new contract directly with Vodafone or Nominet for PSN core services. Another consideration is the domain contract ownership. As only the domain contract owner can validate and submit change requests, it's important to ensure that the domain is owned by the non-government organisation, and not the hosting provider. If the hosting provider is the current domain contract owner, then the non-government organisation should work with the hosting provider to change the ownership before moving services to UKCloud. New PSN DNS A new PSN DNS is being developed that will be free at the point of use for PSN users, relieving them of the responsibility to contract with Nominet for DNS services.

    "keywords": "PSN flattening Overview The Public Services Network (PSN) has been flattened to converge PSN Assured and PSN Protected into a single network. Traffic can now flow between VMs in our Assured and Elevated security domains over the flattened PSN network. The flattened PSN network enables better collaboration between local government, blue light services and central government departments, allowing for more joined-up services, including counter-terrorism initiatives and centralised intelligence, to improve the lives of UK citizens. PSN and CDSZ Although it may now be possible to bypass the Cross Domain Security Zone (CDSZ) to communicate between Elevated and Assured environments using the flattened PSN, you should consider the following: The connection isn't a short hop in the way that you would create a connection between two environments in the same security domain, where communication uses private links to remain within the UKCloud boundary, even over an external network. Instead, traffic needs to leave UKCloud, go through the service provider gateways and then come back into UKCloud. This introduces multiple hops and increases latency. You also need to consider the security implications of traffic leaving the assured environment of the UKCloud platform. You can only use the PSN for specific functions, as approved by the PSN Authority by way of the different PSN Codes of Connection. If you want to use the PSN to communicate between Elevated and Assured, you would need to fully document the use case and request approval by the PSN Authority before you could implement it. You must have a PSN connection in your Elevated environment. Restricting access to PSN Protected services It is possible to make your PSN Protected addresses unreachable to PSN Assured, if required. To do this, send a request via the PSN team contact centre . If your request is successful, the PSN team will notify all PSN Protected providers. In the event of your PSN Protected addresses being on the same subnet as another customer, the PSN team will decide what needs to be done to meet your request.

    "keywords": "Telecommunications Service Provider engagement Overview The purpose of this article is to outline the engagement process, demarcation points and the responsibilities of all parties involved in the provisioning of connectivity into UKCloud's data centres using the HybridConnect and CrownConnect services provided by UKCloud. This article should be provided with any order made with telco providers to ensure that all parties are of the same understanding with regards to implementation. HybridConnect and CrownConnect enable customers to bring in their own MPLS, leased lines or public network connectivity into the UKCloud data centres. These can be paired with Cloud Enablement - the co-location of network attached devices (firewalls, VPN concentrators, and so on) to enable the overlay of encryption technologies on the connectivity. High level process To facilitate a HybridConnect or CrownConnect order, UKCloud expects that: The end customer or partner will order the connection directly with the service provider that they want to contract with. At the same time, the customer or partner will raise a Service Request through the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal to make UKCloud support aware of the need for HybridConnect or CrownConnect. UKCloud will provide information where needed to help the customer or partner complete forms that the telco provider requires in order to progress the order. The telco provider will liaise with Ark to gain site access to perform a site survey and then a subsequent visit to install any kit required into their racks within the Meet Me Room (MMR). Ark will provide connectivity between the telco termination point and the UKCloud patch panel. UKCloud will liaise with the partner or customer to arrange for onward connectivity from the UKCloud patch panel to the UKCloud environment. This may require additional information gathering. In the case where Cloud Enablement is required, this will involve additional engineer work from both customer/partner and UKCloud. UKCloud will complete the logical and physical connectivity to enable a live service. Telcos with a presence in Ark Telco providers will need to have a presence in the Ark MMR in order to provide a service to the customer or partner. The location where a telco has presence defines whether HybridConnect or CrownConnect can be used. If the telco has presence in a core UKCloud location (A9 or SQ17), then HybridConnect can be used. If the telco has presence in Ark but outside of UKCloud's core locations, then CrownConnect must be used. The following telcos have a presence in Ark MMRs: BT * Vodafone * Lumen (Formerly CenturyLink) * Virgin Media * GTT * Redcentric SSE * - has known presence in core UKCloud locations If a service provider does not have a presence in Ark, then they will need to contact Ark Continuity directly in order to gain presence. It is not the responsibility of the customer/partner or UKCloud to contact Ark on behalf of the telco. Completing telco order form When completing the telco order form, it is important to state the correct address of the Ark data centre that the connectivity will be provisioned in. The addresses of UKCloud's core locations are: Farnborough Building A9, Cody Technology Park, Farnborough, Hampshire, GU14 0LX Corsham Building SQ17, Spring Park, Corsham, Wiltshire, SN13 9GB Please ensure that the correct address is used. If you are unsure which data centre your service is provisioned in, contact UKCloud support who will be able to assist you. It is not the responsibility of the customer/partner or UKCloud to know the exact MMR rack locations of the telco providers. Telco providers do know this information and will be responsible for making sure that they capture this. Installation Telcos are responsible for organising directly with Ark to install their equipment in their racks in the MMR. Customers/partners are responsible for organising any co-location of customer/partner equipment with UKCloud. Important All equipment's onward connectivity to the UKCloud platform must be LC-LC fibre (multimode if HybridConnect or singlemode if CrownConnect). It is the responsibility of the partner/customer and telco to ensure that all equipment has the right interface to connect into UKCloud. UKCloud will not be held responsible for any financial penalty or delays in installation due to the wrong equipment interface being supplied by either the partner/customer or the telco. Demarcation Telcos are responsible for all telco owned equipment. This equipment must be installed within a telco rack within the MMR of the Ark data centre and cannot be installed in a UKCloud rack. This includes all telco NTEs, CPEs and other equipment that is under the ownership and/or management responsibility of the telco. Ark are responsible for the connection between the telco kit and the patch panel for onward connectivity to UKCloud. UKCloud are responsible for the connection between the patch panel in the UKCloud data centre suites and the customer co-located equipment (if Cloud Enablement is being used) and/or the UKCloud infrastructure. The customer/partner is responsible for any customer owned equipment that has been installed in a UKCloud rack as part of a Cloud Enablement service. This includes installation, ongoing maintenance and emergency maintenance.

    "title": "Dedicated Compute v2 Service Scope",
    "keywords": "Dedicated Compute v2 Service Scope About this document This document is for customers considering purchasing our Dedicated Compute v2 service. It describes the boundaries of the service, along with the division of responsibilities between UKCloud and the customer to facilitate the changes required. About Dedicated Compute v2 Dedicated Compute v2 enables you to run VMware compute workloads as a reserved, single-tenanted section of our cloud, where the physical CPU and RAM allocations are known. This service is designed for customers who: Are looking to run abnormal sized VMs - such as those larger than our standard T-shirt sizes Looking to meet specific software licensing requirements Have an increased security requirement that can be met by Dedicated Compute infrastructure Default setup We deliver Dedicated Compute v2 by providing you with dedicated physical hosts on which you control resource allocation. The initial Dedicated Compute purchase is a starter pack consisting of two physical hosts. The standard host specification is dual 18 core and 512 GiB of RAM. You can then scale your estate by purchasing additional upgrade packs (an upgrade pack consists of 1 x dual 18 core and 512 GiB of RAM compute host). After nine upgrade packs, you must buy another starter pack. You choose Tier 1 and Tier 2 storage for your VMs, both of which can include a backup service. For pricing, see the UKCloud Pricing Guide . The storage pool isn't a dedicated hardware resource; it's drawn from our UKCloud for VMware block storage solutions. These resources are grouped in a private virtual data centre (pVDC) which is available only to the individual Dedicated Compute customer. Resilience and resource reservations We operate at least N+1 for hardware resilience on our Dedicated Compute v2 service. However, we recommend sizing your resilience according to your workload profile. We will reserve at least one physical host's worth of resources from your allocation to ensure that, in the event of a hardware failure, the service can continue to run and support your workload. During a failure scenario, VMs will be restarted on surviving hosts within the Dedicated Compute v2 cluster. UKCloud is not responsible for any performance degradation of VMs in the Dedicated Compute v2 cluster caused during a failure scenario due to over contention in the remaining hosts. The table below shows the configuration, the resources available to a customer, the number of physical servers in the configuration, and the UKCloud resources reserved to run it. Total resources Resource reservation Customer available resources Starter pack 72 cores, 1024 GiB RAM 50% (36 core, 512 GiB RAM) 36 cores, 512 GiB RAM Starter pack + 1 upgrade pack 108 cores, 1536 GiB RAM 33% (36 core, 512 GiB RAM) 72 cores, 1024 GiB RAM Starter pack + 2 upgrade packs 144 cores, 2048 GiB RAM 25% (36 core, 512 GiB RAM) 108 cores, 1536 GiB RAM Resource utilisation To improve performance, Dedicated Compute v2 uses all physical resources available in the installation and balances the load across them, without consuming the reserved capacity mentioned above. This means that in general operation within the starter pack, there is a 50% utilisation of both physical hosts: However, you can create VMs of any size and shape you require, up to the maximum size of the physical capacity of one host - 36 cores 512 GiB RAM. A VM cannot span across physical hosts. If you create a VM larger than 50% of the host capacity, the Dedicated Compute v2 installation may carry more of the contingency capacity of one physical host than of the others: You can over-contend the resources on your Dedicated Compute v2 as you see fit. Deployment Dedicated Compute v2 utilises a reservation pool allocation model providing fine-grained control over the performance of workloads that are running in the organisation VDC. The reservation pool allocation model is optimal for dedicated workloads. Platform management Dedicated Compute v2 is managed in the same way as our other cloud services, using VMware Cloud Director, the UKCloud Portal, and APIs associated with both. The Dedicated Compute v2 service will be maintained to the same software patch revisions as our main platform. It's not currently possible to see the level of provisioned/utilised resources against the Dedicated Compute v2 service on the UKCloud Portal. (This is a development item on the UKCloud Portal roadmap.) In the meantime, we can provide this information on request. Service provisioning You can request Dedicated Compute v2 via your Service Delivery Manager or using the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. The minimum commitment period to the service is 30 days. The notice period is 30 days. On receipt of all relevant information, we will deploy the service within 10 working days for standard configurations. Dedicated Compute v2 is available only in UKCloud Regions 5 and 6. Customer responsibilities You need to be aware of the following customer responsibilities relating to deployment of, configuration of and migration into the Dedicated Compute v2 service, which are in addition to the usual responsibilities placed on customers of our UKCloud for VMware service: Creating VMs in the new environment. Migrating VMs from existing environments by cloning and copying turned-off VMs, or by moving turned-off vApps to the new environment. Ensuring you have the right licensing in place for the applications in use in your Dedicated Compute v2 environment. If you select the customer-defined deployment option, you must manage your own reservation levels. It is your responsibility to purchase enough Dedicated Compute v2 starter and upgrade packs to ensure that there is enough resource available to your VMs in the event that one or more hosts fail. If you need any help ensuring you have enough resource in your Dedicated Compute v2 cluster, contact your Cloud Architect.

    "title": "Disaster Recovery as a Service FAQs",
    "keywords": "Disaster Recovery as a Service FAQs General What is Disaster Recovery as a Service? Disaster Recovery as a Service (powered by Zerto) can help you improve organisational resilience. It enables rapid migration of applications between your local VMware or Hyper-V based VMs and UKCloud for VMware disaster recovery-enabled regions. Can I protect parts of my application? Yes, you can configure your protection groups, which can include multiple VMs. This enables you to protect whole applications or just the parts that are mission critical and you just can't afford to lose. Each protection group has synchronised recovery points to simplify your recovery processes. Can I carry out a test failover? Yes, you can test running applications on the UKCloud platform to ensure failover is working as intended. Please note that these failover tests will not affect your active applications. What is the cost to test failover? When you perform a test recovery, any VMs recovered are charged at the prices associated with recovered VM sizes. See the UKCloud Pricing Guide for details on VM prices. It's important to note that you will continue to be charged as long as the failover test is active. Once the failover test is stopped, you will no longer be charged for the VMs. What VMware and Hyper-V versions are supported for recovery on UKCloud? For information about the minimum requirements for Disaster Recovery as a Service, based on the currently deployed version of Zerto Virtual Replication (8.5U2) on the UKCloud platform, see the Interoperability Matrix for All Zerto Software Versions . The hypervisor management plane (such as VMware vCenter server) must be installed for Zerto to be compatible with your environment. This means that free hypervisor versions may not be supported. Is the Zerto protection technology available for physical servers? The Zerto technology that underpins the Disaster Recovery as a Service service only supports virtual machines. Physical hardware is not part of the product support. Is the Zerto licence included? Yes, all licensing for Zerto used within Disaster Recovery as a Service is included. The price of Disaster Recovery as a Service is based on the storage tier that the VM is being replicated to. For more information please see the UKCloud Pricing Guide . What connectivity options do I have? All UKCloud connectivity options are available including internet, PSN, HSCN, Janet and RLI. Can I replicate into the UKCloud Elevated environment? If you currently have a PSN connection in your primary site, then you would be able to replicate over PSN into the UKCloud Elevated environment. However, if you do not have a PSN connection at your primary site but would like to replicate into the Elevated environment, you can use an encrypted private line to do so. Contact your Cloud Architect for more details on this. How do I invoke a recovery if my local Zerto console becomes unavailable? Once the initial configuration has been done using the Zerto Portal on the customer infrastructure, all additional configurations and management, including invoking failover and any testing, can be done in the UKCloud target environment, accessing the Zerto Portal via the UKCloud Portal. Is there a way to include appliance storage? Disaster Recovery as a Service addresses server-attached disks, however for appliance storage this is not currently possible. The Zerto technology will be able to replicate if the storage (file or block) is presented to a VM as a virtual disk. How is it billed? The pricing for Disaster Recovery as a Service is simple. You only pay for the data you have allocated to your local VMs. So, for example if your existing VMs use 100GB of UKCloud protected storage, that's all you'll pay UKCloud to protect based on the tier of storage and retention period chosen. How do I modify replication in the UKCloud Elevated environment? Zerto replication to the UKCloud Assured environment can be controlled from the internet-facing Zerto Portal, however replication into the UKCloud Elevated environment can only be controlled via the Elevated Zerto Portal. To access the Elevated Zerto Portal, you need to be connected to it via the PSN, RLI, private encrypted connection or our Secure Remote Access (SRA) service. Does UKCloud install the Zerto software in my data centre? No, you are responsible for the installation and configuration of the Zerto software within your data centre. Additionally, you must ensure that the software version of Zerto running locally is the same as that running within UKCloud. UKCloud will make the appropriate Zerto software versions available. Can I failback to my own data centre or third party data centre? Yes, once you've tested or performed a live failover you can failback onto your own infrastructure using the self-service Zerto Portal. How do I ensure that I have complete recovery in the event of a disaster? Maintain a full copy of your mission critical workloads (data and applications) outside of your production environment - If your workloads are running on UKCloud we recommend protection to the opposite site (Farnborough or Corsham) from where your production workload resides. Test DR regularly – Remember your DR is only as good as your testing. Ensure tests are clearly defined to provide business confidence. UKCloud's DRaaS solution, powered by Zerto, simplifies testing and has no impact on production workloads. Ensure production changes are reflected in your DR plan – If you make changes to existing workloads or add new workloads, ensure these VMs have been included within your virtual protection groups. Update tests to cover these changes. Document your DR plan - And ensure documentation is easily accessible in the event of a disaster. Training – Ensure knowledge is shared amongst your team. Get the team involved and make sure they're familiar with the recovery processes. For more guidance, see the Zerto and UKCloud Disaster Recovery 101 ebook.

When you have set up DRaaS for your VMs, every write operation to the protected VMs is copied and stored in a journal on the recovery site. This means that in the event of a VM being compromised, you can quickly recover the VM to a point in time before the disaster took place. You add disaster recovery protection to your VMs by adding them to a virtual protection group (VPG). Each VM in the VPG is synchronised to the recovery site on the UKCloud platform, and a journal is created. After this initial synchronisation, each subsequent write operation to the VM is processed as normal on the original site and a copy is asynchronously sent to the UKCloud site and written to the journal. Each journal entry exists in the journal for 2, 7, 14 or 28 days (the journal history) depending on your selected service level. When the journal history is reached, as new journal entries are created, older entries are written to the recovery VM's virtual disks. Every few seconds, a checkpoint is written to every journal for each VM in the VPG to ensure crash-consistency between the VMs. If you need to recover a VM, you select a checkpoint to recover to. For example, in the case of a security incident, you could recover to a checkpoint from before the incident. During recovery, the VMs are created in a vApp on the recovery site and the recovery disks for each VM are attached to the recovered VM. Information in the journal is then promoted to the VM to bring it up to the date and time of the selected checkpoint. Two terms you may hear in connection with disaster recovery are recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO). The RPO indicates the amount of data you can afford to lose in the event of a disaster. For example, if your application data changes fairly infrequently, your RPO can be higher as the data remains fairly static. However, if your application data is constantly changing, you'll need your RPO to be smaller to avoid significant loss of data in the event of a disaster. The RTO is the amount of time you can tolerate your application being unavailable in the event of a disaster. For example, if your application provides critical functionality, you'll need to bring it back online very quickly. However, for a less critical application, you may be able to tolerate a longer outage. Because of the use of regular checkpoints (every few seconds), our Zerto-powered DRaaS provides a minimal RPO. The ability to use recovered VMs even before all the journal data has been promoted provides a good RTO as well. Before you begin When you order DRaaS, UKCloud provides you with: The IP address (from the IP range you provided to UKCloud) of the Zerto Cloud Connector (ZCC) deployed in your recovery VDC; you'll need this to complete the setup of the site-to-site VPN between your local environment and your recovery VDC A link to the appropriate version of the Zerto Virtual Manager (ZVM) for you to deploy in your local environment A ZORG ID to identify your Zerto environment within the UKCloud platform Access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal (ZSSP) in the appropriate UKCloud zone, where you can trigger a failover You should consider the following: VMs must be powered on to be synchronised. The operating system used by the protected VMs must also be supported in the recovery site. Disaster Recovery as a Service captures every action. When a VM is deleted, the associated journal is also deleted. We provide service profiles for 2, 7, 14 and 28 day retention. The details of these are available in the Disaster Recovery as a Service Service Scope . We do not currently provide the option for you to create custom profiles. System requirements To use DRaaS, you must have a valid, centrally managed vSphere or HyperV estate. A single hypervisor is not sufficient. The following table lists the requirements for DRaaS, based on the currently deployed version of Zerto Virtual Replication (8.5U2) on the UKCloud platform: Product Supported Version Management Plane VMware vCenter vCenter Server 6.0, 6.5, 6.5 U1, 6.5 U2, 6.5 U3, 6.7, 6.7 U1, 6.7 U2, 6.7 U3, 7.0, 7.0 U1 Microsoft SCVMM 2016 and Server Core: RTM Rollup 3-5, 6, 7, 8, 2019 and Server Core: RTM Rollup 1 Hosts VMware ESXi 6.0, 6.5, 6.5 U1, 6.5 U2, 6.5 U3, 6.7, 6.7 U1, 6.7 U2, 6.7 U3, 7.0, 7.0 U1 Microsoft Hyper-V Windows 2016 Server, Microsoft Hyper-V Server 2019 Virtual Machines Hardware Version VMware 7-9, 10-11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18 Hyper-V Generation 1 & 2 Disaster Recovery as a Service Connectivity Full duplex internet connection 5Mb/s minimum IPsec VPN NA For a complete list of hypervisor features supported when using DRaaS, see the Interoperability Matrix for All Zerto Software Versions . Getting Disaster Recovery as a Service up and running To get DRaaS up and running in your environment, follow the steps below: Create a recovery VDC Set up your local environment Configure networking on the recovery site Create a virtual protection group Perform a failover test Create a recovery VDC To recover your VMs to the UKCloud platform, you must have a VDC in the intended recovery site. If you already have a compute service in the UKCloud site, you can use an existing VDC or you can create a new one using: The UKCloud Portal (for more information see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware ) The UKCloud Portal API (for more information see the How to use the UKCloud Portal API ) If you don't already have a compute service in the UKCloud site or you'd prefer UKCloud to create the VDC for you, you can request this as part of your DRaaS Service Request. Set up your local environment Before you can start using DRaaS, you need to prepare your local environment by: Installing the appropriate version of Zerto Virtual Manager (ZVM) in your local environment Creating a secure site-to-site VPN between your local environment and the UKCloud platform For more information, see How to install and configure Zerto in your local environment . Configure networking on the recovery site You must configure any internally and externally routed networks in your UKCloud recovery VDC to duplicate those in your local environment. You must also configure the edge gateway with the same firewall, NAT and other rules. You'll create the mapping between these networks when you create your VPG (see How to create a virtual protection group ). In the event of a failover, external access to the recovery VDC will be via a different IP address. You'll need to account for any required DNS changes and external connectivity configuration (such as VPNs), to ensure continued external access. Utilising UKCloud's VMware platform, you can configure this in advance. Alternatively, you can use load balancing technologies to manage a seamless switch between environments. Create a virtual protection group A virtual protection group (VPG) is a collection of VMs that are grouped together for disaster recovery purposes. When you create a VPG, a replica of each VM disk is created on the recovery site. These replica virtual disks are then populated with the data in the protected VMs by synchronising the protected VMs with the recovery site replicas. For more information, see How to create a virtual protection group . Perform a test failover After you create your VPG, we recommend that you perform a test failover to confirm that your VMs will be recovered correctly in the event of a live failover. You should also run test failovers periodically to ensure that your VMs can still be recovered successfully. For more information, see How to perform a failover . Next steps You have now performed all the steps needed to set up DRaaS. If you experience a disaster, you can perform a live failover to recover your VMs on the UKCloud platform and continue operation as usual. For more information, see How to perform a failover .

    "keywords": "How to install and configure Zerto in your local environment Overview If you want to use UKCloud's Disaster Recovery as a Service or Migration to the Cloud services, there are some tasks that you must perform to prepare your local environment. UKCloud's Disaster Recovery as a Service enables you to provide a secure, scalable disaster recovery solution for your on-premises environment by replicating your workloads on the UKCloud platform Migration to the Cloud enables you to move your workloads from a local, on-premises environment onto the UKCloud platform. Our Disaster Recovery as a Service and Migration to the Cloud services are powered by Zerto, a leading provider of disaster recovery software for the cloud, so you'll need to install Zerto software in your local environment to enable the replication of your workloads to the UKCloud platform. You'll also need to create a IPsec VPN to connect your local environment to the UKCloud platform. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide, you must have administrator access to the vCenter Server that hosts the VMs that you want to protect or migrate. Before you begin When you raise a Service Request for Disaster Recovery as a Service or Migration to the Cloud, UKCloud provides you with: A ZORG ID to identify your environment within Zerto A link to the appropriate version of Zerto Virtual Manager (ZVM) for you to deploy in your local environment as well as a site address and port for licensing purposes The IP address (from the IP range you provided to UKCloud) of the Zerto Cloud Connector (ZCC) deployed in your target VDC (for recovery or migration); you'll need this to complete the setup of the site-to-site VPN between your local environment and your target VDC Access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal (ZSSP) in the UKCloud zone where your target VDC is located Installing and configuring Zerto Virtual Manager in your local environment As UKCloud's Disaster Recovery as a Service and Migration to the Cloud services are powered by Zerto, you need to set up Zerto Virtual Manager (ZVM) in your local environment to enable your VMs to be replicated on the UKCloud platform. ZVM is responsible for all the Zerto configuration for a site and performs the replication tasks. UKCloud provides a version of ZVM that is compatible with the Zerto software on the UKCloud platform. If Microsoft .NET Framework is not installed, you'll be prompted to install the required version of .NET Framework, which is included as part of the Zerto installation package. After you install .NET Framework, the machine automatically restarts and the Zerto installation begins. Download and run the executable file from the link provided by UKCloud. Note Install ZVM on a Windows Server 2012 R2, 2016 or 2019 server, ideally with nothing else running on it. On the Welcome page of the Zerto Virtual Replication Installation for VMware vSphere wizard, read the information provided then click NEXT . On the License Agreement page, accept the agreement and then click NEXT . On the Select Installation Folder/Directory page, change the location if necessary and then click NEXT . On the Choose Installation Type page, select Express installation and then click NEXT . On the vCenter Server Connectivity page, in the IP / Host Name field, enter the address of the vCenter Server that hosts the VMs that you want to protect or migrate. In the Username and Password fields, enter the administrator credentials for the vCenter Server. In the Site Name field, enter a name to identify the location of this installation of ZVM and then click NEXT . On the Validation page, fix any issues if necessary and then click RUN . After ZVM has finished installing, on the Install Complete page, select the Open the Zerto Virtual Manager interface checkbox and then click DONE . Log in to the Virtual Manager Web Client using your vCenter Server administrator credentials. The first time you log in, you'll need to enter licensing details. As you are using ZVM as part of a UKCloud service, select Pair to a site with a license and enter the Site Address and Port provided by UKCloud. Click START . In ZVM, select the SETUP tab. Click NEW VRA . The Virtual Replication Appliance (VRA) manages the replication of VMs across the two sites. In the Configure and Install VRA dialog, from the Host list, select the IP address of the server that hosts the VMs that you want to protect or migrate. In the Host Root Password field, enter the root password of the VM host server. Complete the other fields in the Host Details section as required. In the VRA Network Details section, enter a static IP address and the gateway details of the network for the VRA to use. Click Install . After the VRA has finished installing, you should be able to see your new VRA in the SETUP tab. Creating a VPN between your local environment and UKCloud As you'll be replicating your VMs from your local environment onto the UKCloud platform, you need to create a secure connection between the two sites. You can do this by creating a site-to-site VPN. For information about how to create a site-to-site VPN, see How to configure IPsec VPN . The following table lists the minimum firewall rules required for Zerto to pair and replicate with the UKCloud platform. Source device Target service Port Direction Purpose Customer ZVM Service Provider ZCC TCP 9081 Bi-directional ZVM to ZCC communication Customer VRA Service Provider ZCC TCP 4007 * Bi-directional TCP control communication between source and target VRAs and ZCC Customer VRA Service Provider ZCC TCP 4008 * Bi-directional TCP communication to pass data between source and target VRAs and ZCC * We recommend that you use ports 9082 to 9200 to allow for increase in VRA on source and target sites. Next steps Now that you have prepared your local environment for Disaster Recovery as a Service or Migration to the Cloud, you can create a virtual protection group (VPG) to identify the VMs that you want to protect or migrate.

    "title": "Troubleshooting Disaster Recovery as a Service",
    "keywords": "Troubleshooting Disaster Recovery as a Service Overview This guide describes some of the issues you may encounter when using UKCloud's Disaster Recovery to the Cloud service: Starting a test failover takes a long time RPO alerts and bitmap syncing Recovery storage errors and journal size alerts during test failovers Test failover VMs do not perform as expected Important During the failover process, any change in the configuration or state of the live or failed‑over VMs (for example, power on or power off) will cause failure of the failover and may corrupt the VPG. This could make a full resync necessary and, in a disaster recovery situation, could prevent failover completely. Starting a test failover takes a long time Cause When you initiate a failover, Zerto creates VMs in vCloud (referred to as testing recovery VMs) and then performs further tasks to provide the correct data for those VMs to boot from. VM creation and other operations in vCloud unavoidably take some time, therefore when performing a simultaneous failover of many VMs, it can take a while before the VMs are powered on and ready for use. Zerto automatically powers on the testing recovery VMs when it has completed the operations necessary to make the correct data available to the VMs. Powering on a VM prematurely will cause it to be corrupted and will impact live replication. Additionally, manually powering-off a testing recovery VM will cause live replication to stop; testing recovery VMs must remain powered on for the duration of the test failover. Solution If you're failing over many VMs simultaneously, you should anticipate that it will take some time before the VMs are powered on and ready for use. Important Do not manually power on or power off recovery VMs during a failover. Doing so will corrupt the VPG. RPO alerts and bitmap syncing Cause Some application and database servers have a high change rate. Limited VPN bandwidth from the on-premises sites means that often changes to the live VMs occur faster than the rate of replication. Solution We recommend that, unless there are specific reasons otherwise, you set the priority of your Disaster Recovery to the Cloud VPGs to Medium to ensure the necessary VPN bandwidth. You can set the priority of VPGs for which a short RPO is essential to High, however, this will cause the other VPGs to have a higher RPO. If your environment includes virtual disks that are used purely as log or temporary file systems, you can designate these disks as Temp Disks. This will mean that the data is synced during the initial sync (to bring over the partitioning/formatting), but ongoing changes that that disk will not be replicated. This can reduce the WAN bandwidth required to keep acceptable RPOs. This will also prevent rapidly changing transaction log file systems from filling up the journal. However, you should carefully consider and test this configuration to make sure that this data is not required in a disaster recovery situation. Recovery storage errors and journal size alerts during test failovers Cause Due to the way that testing recovery VMs are instantiated, Zerto is unable to flush the oldest journal entries into the base recovery disks while a test failover is in progress. This means that the journal size continuously grows while the test failover is in progress, at a rate dependant on the change rate of the live VM. This will cause alerts when the journal reaches 75% of its maximum size. When the journal reaches 100% of its maximum size, replication of the live VM stops since there is nowhere to place new checkpoints. At this point, the VPG will show a state of Recovery Storage Error and will be required to perform a lengthy sync when the test failover is stopped. Solution If it is essential that the journal is continuous, then you should avoid long failover tests, or make arrangements for the live applications to be shut down or quiesced during the failover test. Additionally, you will see Recovery Storage Error and other transient errors in the Zerto console while a test failover is in the process of starting; you can ignore these in all cases. Test failover VMs do not perform as expected Cause Testing recovery VMs (and live failed-over VMs before they are committed) do not run from normal virtual disks. To remove the need to fully clone all data, when Zerto does a test failover (or a live failover before committing) it creates a simulated view onto the VM's disks at the checkpoint time you select. All reads from the disks are intercepted by Zerto's ESXi kernel driver and then processed with reference to the journal to ensure that the correct data for that checkpoint's point-in-time is returned. Additionally, any writes made to the testing recovery VM are diverted to a temporary file. While the test failover is in progress, Zerto is unable to flush the oldest journal checkpoints into the base VMDK disks in order to preserve the integrity of the replicated base disks and journals. Solution Zerto test failovers are intended to give confidence that the data on the VM disks is being correctly replicated. We recommend that you should not use test failover VMs for detailed application testing for the following reasons: If the test failover goes on too long, new changes from the live VM will cause the journal to fill, halting replication of the live VM A large volume of writes to the testing recovery VMs will cause those VMs to fail Storage performance of the testing recovery VMs is very poor, potentially up to 50% slower than native performance These issues are also applicable to live failovers that have not yet been committed. When the commit operation is completed, the resulting VMs are running from normal VMDK files and are no longer subject to these problems. When performing a live failover, we recommend that: You stop the applications on the on-premises site VMs before triggering the failover. This ensures that the application state is consistent at the point of failover and will avoid Recovery Storage Errors due to the journal filling while the VPG is in a live Failover Before Commit state. Do not perform any application testing on the failed-over VMs that might cause too much new data to be written to the VM's disks before commit. If possible, you should complete the commit operation before the failed-over VMs serve production workloads. Additionally, you should consider the following during a live failover: We do not recommend the use of auto commit; this option causes the commit to occur automatically after the failover is initiated. Do not enable reverse replication unless you fully understand all the potential implications of doing so. Enabling reverse replications causes the VMDK disks of the source VMs to be altered to seed the reverse replication. The VPGs in Zerto enter a Needs Configuration state after the failover is committed. We recommend that you delete the VPGs from Zerto at this stage to ensure reverse replication cannot be configured accidently. If reverse replication isn't enabled, the source VMs will remain untouched (even post-commit). It's likely that the live failover (excluding the commit operation) will take a similar length of time as a test failover. The commit operation converts the failed-over VMs into normal vCloud VMs not subject to the limitations inherent to test failover (or live failover before commit) VMs. The commit operation is performed while the VMs (on the UKCloud side) remain running and will take several hours (dependant on the size and change-rate of the live VM).

    "title": "Disaster Recovery as a Service Service Scope",
    "keywords": "Disaster Recovery as a Service Service Scope About this document This document explains what is and isn't included in the scope of our Disaster Recovery as a Service service. Disaster Recovery as a Service provides a seamless way to failover from your own data centre to the UKCloud for VMware service. You can use this service as part of your own business continuity or disaster recovery processes. With this service, you're charged for the amount of data that you're protecting and are only charged for VMs when they are powered on during a live or test failover. About Disaster Recovery as a Service Disaster Recovery as a Service is a powerful, self-service replication and recovery tool that can improve organisational resilience and enable seamless migration of applications between your local VMware or Hyper-V powered data centre and UKCloud's disaster recovery enabled regions. This means that, in the event of a VM being compromised such as a local hardware failure, a power outage or security incident, such as theft or WAN connectivity disruption, you can quickly recover your VMs to the UKCloud platform and ensure that the disruption to your service is minimised. Once configured, you can protect VMs by adding them to a virtual protection group (VPG). Each VM in the VPG is synchronised to your recovery site on UKCloud, and a journal is created. After this initial sync, each subsequent write operation to the VM is processed as normal on your site and a copy is asynchronously sent to the recovery site and written to the journal. When the specified journal history length is reached (for example, 14 days), as new journal entries are created, older entries are written to the recovery VM's virtual disks. Every few seconds, a checkpoint is written to every journal for each VM in the VPG to ensure crash-consistency between the VMs. If you need to recover your VMs, you select a checkpoint to recover to. For example, in the case of a virus you could recover to a checkpoint from before the virus attack. During recovery, the VMs are created on the recovery site and the recovery disks for each VM are attached to the recovered VM. Information in the journal is then promoted to the VM to bring it up to the date and time of the selected checkpoint. Note that each VPG recovered into the recovery site will appear as a vApp within UKCloud. Customers Responsibilities Given the nature of this service, with part of the solution hosted on your site, you are responsible for the following: Your environment must meet the minimum specification required by the solution (that you can find here ). This covers software versions, limitations around the types of VMs that can be protected and the minimum WAN connectivity speeds Installation and configuration of Zerto components including the ZVM (Zerto Virtual Manager) and VRA (Virtual Replication Appliance) Creation of a VPN to connect to UKCloud Ensuring that the local instances of Zerto are upgraded to remain compatible with the current version utilised by UKCloud. You will be notified when the version is upgraded on the UKCloud platform Local network tuning and firewall configurations We'll work with you to help you identify if any issues encountered are within your estate or on the UKCloud platform. You are responsible for troubleshooting issues within your own estate. If you require support managing your local Zerto installation, we have a wide ecosystem of partners that can assist. Frequency and timing UKCloud's Disaster Recovery as a Service is designed to provide recovery points that are only seconds behind the running VM. Our standard profile provides: Target RPO of 5 minutes Journal history of 2, 7, 14 or 28 days At present, we've not enabled the ability for you to configure custom profiles. If the target RPO is exceeded, you and UKCloud will be notified via the Zerto Self-Service Portal (ZSSP). Factors that can affect the RPO are: Rate of change of the data on a VM. VMs with a large rate of change in the data will potentially achieve a slightly longer RPO than VMs that have a lower rate of change Any network latency or storage performance challenges. We monitor our estate to ensure that network and storage performance are in line with platform expectations. Any deviations are alerted to our technical teams to resolve. WAN network performance. Low throughput WAN connections are unlikely to be able to transfer large amounts of data to UKCloud. This can make the initial sync challenging for larger VMs. Additionally, the service raises an alert if the size of a VM's journal exceeds 75% of the original VM. This alert helps to understand if your solution is adequately protected. Disaster Recovery as a Service captures data only while a VM is powered on. If a VM is deleted in VMware Cloud Director, it will IMMEDIATELY delete the associated journal. What SLA do you offer on Disaster Recovery as a Service? We don't offer an SLA around the VMs protected by our Disaster Recovery as a Service. However, the status of VMs is monitored continuously, and the UKCloud support team investigates all failures or service degradation. Other The service is not backed by Service Credits. On occasion, planned maintenance may disrupt the operation of the Disaster Recovery as a Service. This may lead to the service being unavailable, or a temporary increase to the RPO you may be able to achieve on the platform. If there's a potential disruption, we'll highlight this to you via the UKCloud Service Status page . Disaster Recovery as a Service management You can self-manage your protected environment via the ZSSP. This portal enables you to: Configure virtual protection groups Opt VMs into the VPGs Monitor the performance of your platform View the current RPO of your applications and current available history Perform test failovers Perform live failovers We've disabled some areas of the ZSSP as they're for services we don't presently support. These include: Backup to external systems. At present, you cannot export your journal to external backup targets (such as UKCloud Cloud Storage). We've identified a compliance issue with this solution, which we're working to address. Until this is addressed, the feature will remain unavailable. Additionally, the following scenarios cannot be protected: VMs with virtual disks with individual disks greater than 3TB VMs that are clustered using shared virtual disks Alerting and reporting The ZSSP provides live real-time reporting of your solution and the current level of protection being provided to your VMs. The portal also raises alerts if the target RPO of your VPG exceed the threshold, or if the associated journal size grows beyond the expected size. In both these scenarios, UKCloud also receives a platform monitoring alert and will investigate the cause. Additionally, the ZSSP provides an activity log of the actions against a particular VM and a list of any errors captured on the platform. Failover The ZSSP enables you to failover to your recovery site. When this is initiated, Disaster Recovery as a Service fails over the VMs inside a VPG, restoring the data and state of the VMs to the desired point from the journal. Disaster Recovery as a Service can also replicate any internal networking rules. You need to: Manually configure external networking configurations, including configuring VPNs and making any external firewall or DNS changes Check for application consistency Licensing UKCloud provides licensing for VMs protected by Zerto that utilise UKCloud as their recovery site. At present, you cannot bring your own licensing. Feedback If you find a problem with this article, click Improve this Doc to make the change yourself or raise an issue in GitHub.

After this date, anyone using the PSN will not be able to use email over this network, including all email services from UKCloud on the PSN. Internet-connected email services from UKCloud will continue to function after this date. Overview UKCloud offers an Email and Collaboration service, powered by Zimbra, to enable you to have a cloud hosted, secure email service, connected to government networks or the internet. You can connect this mail service through your normal mail applications (for example, Microsoft Outlook), to send and receive mail as well as use lightweight collaborative features. This Getting Started Guide walks you through the process of configuring your Email and Collaboration service. Intended audience This guide is intended for users who want to set up their Email and Collaboration as a Service. To complete the steps in this guide you must have login credentials for an administrator account and access to the Zimbra administration console. Introduction to Email and Collaboration as a Service The Zimbra Collaboration Suite that underpins UKCloud's email offering provides a wide range of client connectivity options. An advanced webmail client allows the full feature set within the suite to be accessed from anywhere that internet connectivity is available and from virtually any platform via a wide-range of supported browsers A cross-platform desktop application is provided extending the functionality of the web client by enabling email to be read and composed while offline IMAP and POP3 clients are supported Calendar and contacts can be accessed via the CalDav and CardDav protocols Full Microsoft Outlook integration is supported using the Zimbra Collaboration Suite Connector for Outlook, which utilizes a full MAPI provider that leverages the Microsoft-standard MAPI interface for contacts, calendar, and other functionality not supported by IMAP or POP The service provides enterprise-class functionality for end-users, on a per-mailbox, per- month pricing model. It offers several options for mailbox access, including POP3, IMAP4 and SMTP --- all with TLS (SSL) encryption --- as well as HTTPS. Exchange ActiveSync is also supported. Although the service was designed with end-users in mind, there's nothing to stop you using the supported protocols to allow an application to access a mailbox in order to send or receive email. This will generally be achieved via SMTP or POP3 over TLS. It's worth noting that there's a minimum commitment of 25 mailboxes with this service --- but they don't all have to be used. Before you begin To start using the Email and Collaboration service, you first need to decide on a domain name, which must be a real-world, registered domain name. You can use a new domain name, or simply delegate a sub-domain of your organisation's existing domain name. You'll need to configure your chosen domain's MX record as mail.skyscapecs.net . Once you've decided on a domain name and submitted your service request, UKCloud will configure your domain name on our platform and create an administrator account. You'll receive a welcome email with details of your administrator account with delegated rights for your email domain. This account will usually be in the following format: admin@<yourdomain> For example: admin@example.com You'll receive the account details as part of the onboarding process; we recommend that you change the account's password immediately. This is the account you'll use to create mailboxes on the platform. You'll need to create a mailbox for each email address you want to be able to send or receive from. Supported browsers Refer to the Zimbra Collaboration Supported Systems document for the most up to date list, at: https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/8.7.0/Supported_Systems Firefox and Chrome on Windows, Mac, Linux Internet Explorer on Windows Safari on Mac and Windows Accessing the Zimbra administration console The Zimbra administration console is a browser-based user interface for managing your mailbox server and mailbox accounts. The Assured OFFICIAL console is accessible from the internet. We'll provide you with the URL for the administration console along with your account details. Creating a user account Creating a user account sets up the appropriate entries in the LDAP directory server. When the user logs in for the first time, or when the first email is delivered to the user's account, the mailbox is created on the mailbox server. To create a user account: In the administration console, select Manage and then Accounts . Click the gear symbol in the top-right of the main panel and select New . Enter an Account name and the user's Last name (the other fields are optional). If the new account will be an administrator, select the Administrator checkbox in the Account Setup section. Scroll down to set the initial Password then click Next . Enter the new user's contact information then click Next . Enter any aliases required for the account then click Next . Add the account to any required distribution lists then click Next . If the account is an administrator account, you need to add it to the administration group at this point, to grant the necessary rights within the domain. To do this: In the Find field under Add distribution lists to the account , enter admingroup and click Search . Select the resulting admingroup@<yourdomain> , for example admingroup@example.com . Click Add at the bottom of the dialog box to make the new account a member of the group. Specify any forwarding rules. Click Finish to complete creation of the account. The user can log in to and use the account immediately. It will take up to an hour to add the account to the Global Address List, during which time the account name won't be listed as an auto-complete option for users composing emails. Getting to know the Zimbra web client Zimbra offers standard HTML, advanced JavaScript, and mobile web clients that you can log into. The web clients include mail, calendar, address book, and task functionality. You can select the client to use when you log in. The advanced web client includes Ajax capability and offers a full set of web collaboration features. This web client works best with newer browsers and fast internet connections. The standard web client is a good option when internet connections are slow or if you prefer HTML-based messaging for navigating within your mailbox. The mobile web client provides an experience optimized for smaller screen formats available on mobile devices. Typically when you log in, you'll see the advanced Zimbra web client. You can switch to a different version if you prefer by using the Version list on the login screen. If the Zimbra web client detects that the screen resolution is 800x600, you're automatically redirected to the standard web client. You can still select the advanced web client but will see a warning message suggesting the use of the standard client for a better screen view. When connecting to Zimbra using a mobile web browser, Zimbra will automatically detect and default to the mobile web client. To access the Zimbra web client: Go to the following location: https://mail.ukcloud.com/ Log in using your account's email address and password. Installing the Zimbra desktop client The Zimbra desktop client delivers a consistent user experience offline, so email, social media, calendar, contacts, files and documents are synchronized and locally accessible when on the road. Zimbra Desktop aggregates information across accounts (Zimbra, Yahoo! Mail, Gmail, Hotmail, etc.) and social networks (Facebook, Digg, Twitter, etc.) to help make communicating and sharing information easier than ever. Download Zimbra Desktop from: https://www.zimbra.com/downloads/zimbra-desktop/ Note The desktop client is supported on Windows, Mac and Linux. Once installed open the client and click the Add New Account button. From the Account Type list, select Zimbra and complete the form as shown in the image below, substituting the Email Address and Password with your account details. When you're done, click Validate and Save . The new account will be listed. Click Launch Desktop . Configuring IMAP and POP3 clients A wide variety of IMAP and POP3 clients are available natively, or for download and use within Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS and BlackBerry. There are far too many to cover in detail so examples of setting up the more common desktop applications will be detailed here. The following settings should work with any application that adheres to the IMAP or POP3 protocol standards. IMAP is the preferred protocol and should be used if available. Incoming mail server (IMAP): mail.ukcloud.com Encrypted connection type: SSL IMAP/S port: 993 Incoming mail server (POP3): mail.ukcloud.com Encrypted connection type: SSL POP3/S port: 995 Outgoing mail server (SMTP): mail.ukcloud.com Encrypted connection type: SSL/TLS SMTP/S port: 465 Configuring Microsoft Outlook To configure Outlook: In Outlook, select File then Add Account .

This can be referred to as an electronic mailshot. IMAP The Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is a mail protocol used for accessing email on a remote web server from a local client. LDAP Lightweight Directory Access Protocol is an Internet protocol that email and other programs use to look up information from a server. LDAP is mostly used by medium-to-large organisations. POP POP stands for Post Office Protocol. POP3 is version 3 of the protocol. When an e-mail is sent to your address, it is stored on the mail server until it is downloaded via your e-mail client (Outlook, your mobile, etc.) using POP3. After the e-mail has been downloaded to your client, it is removed from the server altogether. SMTP Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. SMTP is used when email is delivered from an email client, such as Outlook Express, to an email server or when email is delivered from one email server to another. SMTP uses port 25. TLS Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), both frequently referred to as \"SSL\", are cryptographic protocols that provide communications security over a computer network.

Use your Windows Mobile device's File Manager to select the MyCertificate.crt.cer file. You should receive a message that the file was imported. Enable SSL in ActiveSync on your device. Zimbra Mobile Connector for BlackBerry Enterprise Server With the Zimbra Mobile Connector for BlackBerry Enterprise Server (ZCB), users can access the Zimbra Collaboration Suite (ZCS) server using their BlackBerry mobile devices. ZCB is a plug-in that enables synchronization of mail, address books (including GAL), calendars, and tasks between ZCS and a BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) for Microsoft Exchange, using MAPI. To install and run ZCB, you must have the most recently updated versions of servers, software, and equipment. Preparing for ZCB Installation Before installing ZCB, you must install MAPI/CDO, BES, and Outlook, along with the latest service packs. Following this, you must stop the BlackBerry Controller service. Installing CDO, Outlook and BES Use the appropriate software documentation to install the following: Install Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and the latest service packs. Install Microsoft Exchange Server MAPI/CDO 1.2.1 and the latest service packs. Install BlackBerry Enterprise Server for Microsoft Exchange 4.1 or BlackBerry Professional Software for Microsoft Exchange 4.1 Note During the BES installation, after you enter your SRP information, you may be prompted to enter profile creation information in a Microsoft Exchange Server dialog. Press OK to skip this step. Ignore any subsequent BES profile errors, such as an Invalid properties error. During the BES installation ignore warnings such as Exchange Server is not detected errors or could not verify the Microsoft Exchange permissions errors. Install Outlook 2007 with Service Pack 2. Before continuing, make sure that you have completed setting up MAPI/CDO, BES, and Outlook. Stop the BlackBerry Controller Service. The BlackBerry Controller service that controls the BlackBerryAgent process is a MAPI client. In order to install ZCB, all MAPI clients must be inactive.

Open the .msi file to start the Installation Wizard, accept the license agreement and click Next . The ZCB is being installed. Click Next and then click Close to complete the installation. Provisioning accounts Before you can provision accounts, the following must be set up: Create a Zimbra administrator account for BES. For ZCS 5.0.19 or earlier you create a Zimbra administrator. For 6.0.0 or later, you create a global administrator account. (This is the same administrator account, but in 6.0 the name was changed to global administrator). Recreate the BlackBerry Manager and BlackBerry Server mail profiles. Following this, you can provision user accounts. After user accounts have been provisioned, restart your BlackBerry Controller service. Creating a BES Zimbra administrator account on ZCS Create a BES administrator account on the ZCS server in order to provision user accounts. Having a BES administrator account separate from the ZCS administrator account will allow you to specifically monitor BES use and statistics. Use the following steps to create this account: Log in to the Zimbra administration console. Go to Accounts . From the New menu, select Account . Complete the fields in the New Account dialog box. For 5.0.19 or earlier, select Administrator . For ZCS 6.0.0 or later, select Global Administrator . Note The user name and password will be used to create the BES manager and server mail profiles. Click Finish . Creating new BlackBerryManager and BlackBerryServer profiles Before you can provision BES accounts, you must delete and recreate the BES BlackBerryManager and BlackBerryServer mail profiles, using the account information from the BES Administrator account. Both of these profiles are configured identically. Use the following steps to create these two mail profiles. Important Before you can create the two mail profiles: The BlackBerry Controller service must be stopped. Because the process of installing ZCB may have caused the BlackBerry Controller service to restart, verify that it is not running before continuing. If your BES profiles will be opened with Outlook, when creating the mail profiles, select prompt for a profile to be used . Do not use the default. To create the BlackBerryManager profile Start the Mail Control Panel applet. Go to Control Panel > Mail > Show Profiles . Select the existing BlackBerryManager profile, and click Remove . Click Add to create a new profile. Enter BlackBerryManager in the New Profile dialog box, then click OK . In the Server Type dialog box, select Additional Server Types , then Click Next . In the Additional Server Types dialog box, from the Additional Server Types list, select Zimbra Collaboration Server . In the Zimbra Server Configuration Settings dialog box, on the Server Configuration tab, enter the following information: Server Name - This should be set to your Zimbra Server name and port number. This should be in the form of example.domain.com:7071 Note This must be the mailbox host name. It must be a direct access to the mailbox server, it cannot be the proxy server. ZCS proxy is not supported at this time. Select Secure Connection Email Address - This should be the name of the BES administrator account that you created on the ZCS server. This should be in the form of adminname@example.com Password - This should be the password of the BES administrator account that you created on the ZCS server Click OK . Create the BlackBerryServer profile Select the existing BlackBerryServer profile, and click Remove . Click Add to create a new profile. In the New Profile dialog box, enter BlackBerryServer then click OK . In the Server Type dialog box, select Additional Server Types then click Next . In the Additional Server Types dialog box, from the Additional Server Types list, select Zimbra Collaboration Server . In the Zimbra Server Configuration Settings dialog box, on the Server Configuration tab, enter the following information: Server Name - This should be set to your Zimbra Server name and port number. This should be in the form of example.domain.com:7071 . Select Secure Connection . Email Address - This should be the name of the BES administrator account that you created on the ZCS server. This should be in the form of adminname@example.com . Password - This should be the password of the BES administrator account that you created on the ZCS server. Click OK . Restart your BlackBerry Controller service. When your BlackBerry Controller service restarts, BES begins to synchronize the Global Address List (GAL). Provisioning accounts with the BES Manager Once the GAL has finished syncing, use BES Manager to provision user accounts and create the Activation Password. Note It may take several minutes before BES is able to synchronize the GAL. Larger GALs may take longer to synchronize. You may be unable to provision users until the GAL has been fully synchronized. ZCB SMB only supports over the air (OTA) activation, so you must set an activation password. For more information on provisioning accounts using the BES Manager, refer to your BES documentation. Multi-agent configuration When a single instance of BES used with the Zimbra Collaboration Suite Connector is expected to support more than 100 users, the Zimbra multi-agent configuration (MAC) for BES must be used. In the multi-agent configuration, processing of users provisioned on BES is distributed among multiple static agents. Activating devices When user accounts are provisioned in BES, ZCB syncs with the ZCS server to build a local cache of each user's data. Once this synchronization is complete, users can activate their devices over the air (OTA). OTA activation is performed through the Enterprise Activation application on users' devices. To activate a device, users use the email address that was provisioned for them in BES and the enterprise activation password. Important If users reprovision their BlackBerry mobile device, they must first wipe the device before activating their accounts.

We will continue to support all existing customers who are using this service, however, we are no longer providing this service for new workloads. This article provides existing Email and Collaboration customers with access to support documentation and we will continue to update it as required. For new requests, contact your Account Manager or Service Delivery Manager. Important PSN Email Relay provided by Vodafone is end-of-life as of 31 March 2021. After this date, anyone using the PSN will not be able to use email over this network, including all email services from UKCloud on the PSN. Internet-connected email services from UKCloud will continue to function after this date. Overview Zimbra Collaboration Server Network Edition with Zimbra Mobile enabled integrates natively over the air with the Mail, Contact and Calendar applications on any Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. By using the ActiveSync protocol no additional download is required, only that WiFi or a wireless data plan is enabled. After a simple configuration step you can work virtually anywhere with your Zimbra account on the go. You can use the Apple iPhone to access your Zimbra account three primary ways: Enter Zimbra Mobile settings for email, contact and calendar sync View Zimbra in the Safari mobile web browser Enter IMAP/POP3 email settings For more information about ActiveSync, go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActiveSync . Important Performing the following steps may delete all of the existing contacts on your iPhone. This is a common problem for iPhone users when creating a new ActiveSync account. You should ensure that you have backed up all of your contacts before proceeding. Installation and setup for iPhone On your iPhone Home screen, tap the Settings icon. Scroll down and select Passwords & Accounts . Select Add Account . Choose Exchange . Enter your account information. Email: This is your company email address (for example, user@example.net ) Password: This is your Zimbra password (the same one used for the Zimbra Web Client) Description: This is a description for yourself; use your preferred name for this account Domain: If iOS asks for a domain, leave the field blank Click Next . Enter your server details as supplied by your UKCloud Service Delivery Manager (SDM). Synchronise Mail , Contacts , and/or Calendars as you prefer by setting the appropriate sliders to on. If you already have contacts, a screen displays asking if you want to keep your current contacts on your iPhone. If you select Keep on My iPhone , you may see duplicate entries of your contacts. Click Save . Your Zimbra Mobile account is now set up and will synchronize to your iPhone. You can now edit your global or account-specific settings as described in the next section. Changing Your Account Settings When you have successfully set up your account, you should begin to see mail folders, contacts, and your calendar(s) appear on your device. When the synchronization completes, you can edit your global or account-specific settings. In Passwords & Accounts you can set global or account-specific usability controls for your email account(s), including setting the number of messages to show, how many lines of an email to preview, font size, how often to sync, and more. Note When you make a global setting, all your email accounts are affected. When you make an account-specific setting, only the selected email account is affected. Calendar Sync Filter Select your Zimbra Account and then select Account Info to adjust whether you want any of the syncing options changed, how many days of email and which folders you want synced. Important If you have a large calendar, you may have some issues if you are syncing more than 200 appointments. Email Sync Filter Select your Zimbra Account and then select Account Info to adjust whether you want any of the syncing options changed, how many days of email and which folders you want synced. Important If you select No Limit and you have a large amount of email, you may have some issues syncing. Accessing ZCS using Zimbra Mobile Web Client All devices with an HTML‑compatible browser can access Zimbra email, contacts, calendar, and briefcase using the Zimbra Mobile Web Client. To use the Zimbra Mobile Web Client, open the HTML-compatible browser on your phone (the Safari icon on your iPhone) and type in the URL of your Zimbra Server with /m/ at the end of the URL. For example, https://domain.servername.com/zimbra/m/ . If you have Zimbra Collaboration 8.x or above, you can use the new Touch Client. You must have a License 1.2 for your server. n your mobile type the URL of your Zimbra Server. For example, `https://domain.servername.com/'. You can see Emails, Contacts and Calendars for now, and it uses an HTML5 interface, so you can see it in your iPad too. Getting Zimbra email using IMAP/POP3 You can read your email on your iPhone just like you would with a desktop email client by setting it up for IMAP or POP3 access. This option is available to both free Open Source users and paying Network Edition users. Note This method only syncs email messages. To access your Zimbra contacts and calendars, use either Zimbra Mobile Web client in the Safari browser or upgrade to Zimbra Network Edition. Under Mail settings, select Add Account . Select Other . Select IMAP , POP3 or Exchange as appropriate. Fill in the Name , Address and Description fields. In the Incoming Mail Server section, provide the Host Name , User Name and Password . Your iPhone automatically detects IMAP over SSL if your server requires it. If your server requires a non-default TCP port specification, use the hostname:port format in the Host Name field. You can adjust SSL settings laster under the Advanced section in the main account settings. In the Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP) section, provide the Host Name , User Name and Password . As with the incoming mail server, the Host Name setting accepts the hostname:port format if the outgoing mail server uses a non-default TCP port. Save the configuration. Note To enable the browsing of child folders of your inbox, but not peer folders such as Sent, Drafts, Trash and Junk, in the Advanced section of your account settings, set the IMAP Path Prefix to INBOX . Accessing Zimbra with Tethered Sync Options It is possible to sync iPhone contacts and calendars using Connector for iSync (Apple) or Connector for Outlook (Windows) or on Linux via iTunes. These options are unsupported by Zimbra and we recommend using Zimbra Mobile instead. SSL Certificates, the iPhone, and Zimbra Mobile The iPhone prefers non self-signed SSL connections. If you have a self-signed certificate, you should install the iPhone Configuration Utility to deploy a self-signed certificate on the iPhone. For more information, see: http://www.apple.com/support/iphone/enterprise/ . An iPhone client must address the Exchange ActiveSync server using the primary name of the server's SSL certificate. This is important when the Zimbra server is being run in a split‑horizon DNS environment, because the name by which you address the EAS server must resolve to the same (public) IP address, no matter where you are. If the Zimbra server does not use the primary server name, if you want to use SSL, you must rebuild the certificate using the primary name. Creating New Mail Notification via SMS You may wnat the Zimbra server to send you a text message when you receive a new email. Click Options . Choose Mail . Select Enable address for new mail notifications . Enter your SMS address in email format. For example number@txt.att.net . Click Save . Now the server will send you a text message when you receive a new email. Text messaging rates may apply.

After this date, anyone using the PSN will not be able to use email over this network, including all email services from UKCloud on the PSN. Internet-connected email services from UKCloud will continue to function after this date. Overview Many customers who use UKCloud's IaaS need to be able to send email from, or receive email into, their applications. Although we don't have an SMTP relay service dedicated to this purpose, you can use our Email and Collaboration service to meet your needs. This can be particularly valuable if you're using secure government networks such as HSCN, where few mail relay providers are available. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process for configuring your application to use our Email & Collaboration service. UKCloud Email and Collaboration as a Service The service provides enterprise-class functionality for end-users, on a per-mailbox, per- month pricing model. It offers several options for mailbox access, including POP3, IMAP4 and SMTP --- all with TLS (SSL) encryption --- as well as HTTPS. Exchange ActiveSync is also supported. Although the service was designed with end-users in mind, there's nothing to stop you using the supported protocols to allow an application to access a mailbox in order to send or receive email. This will generally be achieved via SMTP or POP3 over TLS. It's worth noting that there's a minimum commitment of 25 mailboxes with this service --- but they don't all have to be used. Getting started with Email and Collaboration To start creating mailboxes on the Email and Collaboration service, you first need to decide on a domain name, which must be a real-world, registered domain name. You can use a new domain name, or simply delegate a sub-domain of your organisation's existing domain name. You'll need to configure your chosen domain's MX record as mail.skyscapecs.net . Once you've decided on a domain name and submitted your order form, the UKCloud team will configure your domain name on our platform and provide you with credentials for an administrator account. You'll be able to use this account to create mailboxes on the platform. A mailbox will be needed for each email address you want to be able to send from, or receive to. Configuring a mailbox for use with an application This section takes you through the process of configuring a mailbox on UKCloud's Email and Collaboration platform for use with an application. The first step is to create a mailbox for this purpose. Once your domain name and administrator accounts have been configured, you can do this by logging on to the Administrator console at https://mail.ukcloud.com:9071/zimbraAdmin/ Create a new mailbox --- configure the account name and password as you normally would, but make sure you don't choose the option to force a password change: Configure the remaining options in the New Account wizard to suit, then click Finish to complete the mailbox creation. You're now ready to configure your application to connect to the mailbox to send and/or receive mail. Sending outbound email To send outbound email, your application needs to support SMTP authentication and TLS encryption. Provided this is the case, simply configure the following settings in your application: SMTP Server/Mail relay host: mail.ukcloud.com Port number: 465 Use TLS*: Yes Username/Password: as configured From Address: as configured Note The mail server doesn't support upgrading from an insecure connection via the STARTTLS command. Your application will need to establish a secure connection before submitting SMTP commands. Receiving inbound email To receive inbound email, your application needs to support POP3 or IMAP4 over TLS. Provided this is the case, simply configure the following settings in your application: Mailbox server: mail.ukcloud.com Protocol: POP3S or IMAPS Port number: 993 (POP3S) or 995 (IMAPS) Username/Password: as configured Applications without TLS support Unfortunately, not all applications support sending or receiving mail over TLS. Some older applications may not support TLS at all, and some require use of the STARTTLS command for sending mail. In this situation, you could consider using a 'wrapper' application, which will create the TLS tunnel independently of your application. A good example of such an application is stunnel: https://www.stunnel.org/index.html Stunnel can secure SMTP, IMAP4, POP3 (or any other protocol) as follows: A listener is created on your local system on a designated TCP port Applications open unencrypted connections to this port When an application connects, stunnel will open a secure connection to the UKCloud mail server All commands sent by the application will be proxied directly to the UKCloud mail server over the secure connection When the application terminates the insecure connection, stunnel terminates the secure connection The diagram below shows stunnel encrypting SMTP traffic. Note An example working stunnel config is below to send smtp traffic on port 25 to zimbra on TLS port 465 [smtp] accept = 25 client = yes connect = mail.ukcloud.com:465 ;delay = yes You can get full documentation, how to and FAQ guides from the stunnel website.

This article provides existing Email and Collaboration customers with access to support documentation and we will continue to update it as required. For new requests, contact your Account Manager or Service Delivery Manager. Overview This article outlines what is considered to be fair use of UKCloud's Email and Collaboration (Email) service. Policy scope The Email and Collaboration fair use policy includes all UKCloud's Email services and any ancillary services that support or are under the product description of Email. Policy statements Application of this policy: The Email and Collaboration fair use policy ensures that all customers who use Email get a fair share of the use of that resource, and that no customer is disadvantaged by the conduct of others. UKCloud can monitor Email volumes and ensure that customers do not excessively use the Email service. Examples of excessive use that may affect other customers include, but are not limited to: a. Sending more than 30 emails per minute from a single account, affecting the mail forwarding system. b. Retaining more than 1,000,000 emails within a single mailbox, affecting the system backup schedule. UKCloud has the right to vary the terms of this Fair Use Policy at UKCloud's sole discretion. UKCloud may rely on its Fair Use Policy where any customer's usage of the service is deemed to be causing disruption to other customers using the same service. Where UKCloud identifies a customer's Email usage is disrupting other customers, UKCloud reserves the right to suspend specific customer Email accounts and ensure that fair use is maintained for all customers. UKCloud will then contact the customer and provide evidence showing the disruption to other users. UKCloud will work with the customer to identify ways to either utilise the resource in line with this policy or suggest a more appropriate product for their requirements. Examples of where UKCloud would demonstrate that a customer's email usage is disruptive to other customers could be: a. Metrics showing excessive queueing in mail forwarders where a customer's account(s) are shown to be sending more than 30 emails per minute. b. Metrics showing failed backups of the Email system, where the backup of the system database containing customer's account(s) can be seen failing 2 in 3 times. This policy is supplementary to customer obligations outlined in any contract agreed between the two parties. Responsibilities UKCloud will exercise its discretion and judgement in the administration of this policy.

    "title": "How to migrate edge configuration data to another edge",
    "keywords": "How to migrate edge configuration data to another edge Overview When moving VMware workloads between regions on the UKCloud platform, if you want to apply same edge configuration data to an edge in the new region, you need to export edge configuration data to an XML file and then migrate that data to the new edge. As part of the migration, some aspects of the environment may change, therefore you'll need to edit the exported XML file to make those changes before applying the configuration to the new edge. While the migration of edge configuration is not a common process, there are certain activities that may require this to make the transition from one edge to another much simpler and quicker. The main reason this would likely be needed is when migrating workloads between regions, where, for the most part, the edge configuration needs to remain the same, but some amendments, such as a change in IP address, are required. This article explains how to use the Cloud Director API to export configuration from an NSX edge, make the necessary amendments and then apply this configuration to a different edge. Before you begin Before using the Cloud Director API to migrate edge configuration data, you should install a REST client to enable you to easily access the Cloud Director API and interact with the relevant endpoints. This example uses the RESTClient browser plug in, but you can use an alternative API client if you prefer. You also need to obtain your API credentials. For more information, see How to access VMware Cloud Director through the Cloud Director API . Obtaining an authorisation token To start interacting with the Cloud Director API, you first need to obtain an x-vcloud-authorization token; to do this you need to adjust some settings in RESTClient. In your browser, click the RESTClient icon. From the Method menu, select POST . In the API field, enter the API URL you recorded earlier and append the following: /api/sessions Next, add a Basic Authentication header. To do this, from the Authentication menu at the top of the REST Client, select Basic Authentication . In the Basic Authentication dialog box, in the Username field, enter your API username recorded earlier from the API page. In the Password field enter your UKCloud Portal password and then click Okay . The Request section now includes an Authorization header. Next, add an Accept header. To do this, from the Headers menu, select Custom Header . In the Request Header dialog box, in the Name field, enter Accept In the Value field enter application/*+xml;version=34.0 and then click Okay . The Headers section should now be displayed, containing the Accept header. The RESTClient has now got all the required settings in place to make a request to the Cloud Director API to obtain a x-vcloud-authorization token, so click the Send button. When a response is received, the Headers tab in the Response section will be populated, including an x-vcloud-authorization token. The x-vcloud-authorization token will replace the Basic Authentication header added earlier. To do this highlight and copy the string of characters displayed after the word x-vcloud-authorization . Note If at any point while following the instructions in this guide, the output displayed in the REST Client does not look similar to that shown in the images, you can use the value of the Status Code field to determine what went wrong and needs investigation. In this case above, the Status Code received was HTTP 200 OK , which means that the request succeeded. For a list of HTTP response codes, see HTTP Response Codes . To add an x-vcloud-authorization header, from the Headers menu, select Custom Header . In the Request Header dialog box, in the Name field enter x-vcloud-authorization . In the Value field, paste the string of characters copied in the previous step, then click Okay . Now that you've obtained an x-vcloud-authorization token, you can remove the Basic Authentication Header. Click the x in the upper right-hand corner of the header. Retrieving organisation details via the API Now that you've obtained an x-vcloud-authorization token, you can call the Cloud Director API to retrieve the information that you need about your organisation to extract your edge configuration data. Set the Method to GET . In the Response section, select the Preview tab. This view lists the links that you can use to drill down into the various objects exposed via the Cloud Director API. Of interest in the output below is a link that will, when queried, return details about the organisation and the objects contained within it. The link should look something like: https://<api_url>/api/org/<org_id> Copy the URL and paste it into the Request URL field. Click Send . After a short amount of time the contents of the Response Preview tab will be updated to reflect the response from the Cloud Director API to your latest request, including links to each virtual data centre (VDC) in the organisation. Retrieving virtual data centre details via the API When locating the VDC and exporting the edge configuration, perform this for both the existing environment and the new environment that you'll be migrating to. To retrieve details about the VDCs in an organisation: Copy the link for the VDC that contains the edge gateway. The link should look something like: https>//<api_url>/api/vdc/<vdc_id> Click Send . The contents of the Response Preview tab will be updated again. Retrieving edge gateway configuration via the API To retrieve details of the edge gateway configuration: The response this time will probably be quite long. To easily locate a specific section in the response, use your browser's search utility. You can invoke this in Firefox by pressing CTRL+F . In the search dialog window at the bottom of the screen, enter edgeGateways and then click the down arrow button to locate a section that looks similar to the one shown below: <Link rel=\"edgeGateways\" href=\"https://<api_url>/api/admin/vdc/<vdc_id>/edgeGateways\" type=\"application/vnd.vmware.vcloud.query.records+xml\" /> Copy the link ending in /edgeGateways and paste it into the URL field at the top of the RESTClient. Ensure that the Method drop down is set to GET and click Send . If this request is successful, the response will contain a link to the edge gateway which, when queried, will return the configuration of the edge gateway. Once you've received a response, use your browser's search utility to locate the EdgeGatewayRecord section within the response. <EdgeGatewayRecord gatewayStatus=\"READY\" haStatus=\"UP\" isBusy=\"false\" name=\"<edge_name>\" numberOfExtNetworks=\"1\" numberOfOrgNetworks=\"8\" vdc=\"https://<api_url>/api/vdc/<vdc_id>\" href=\"https://<api_url>/api/admin/edgeGateway/<edge_id>\" task=\"https://<api_url>/api/task/<task_id>\" isSyslogServerSettingInSync=\"true\" taskOperation=\"networkConfigureEdgeGatewayServices\" taskStatus=\"success\" taskDetails=\" \" /> Within the EdgeGatewayRecord section of the above from the response, locate the link to the edge gateway that starts with the following: https://<api_url>/api/admin/edgeGateway/ At the end of the URL will be a unique identifier for the edge gateway within the VDC. Copy this link, paste it into the URL field and then click Send . After a short amount of time the current configuration of the edge gateway will be displayed in a block of XML. Reviewing and updating the edge gateway configuration The edge configuration information is contained between <Configuration> and </Configuration> tags. This block of XML is split into sections that detail the configuration settings applied to a specific item, function or service available on the edge gateway. The example below shows a high‑level overview of the structure of the XML block returned: <EdgeGateway> <Configuration> <GatewayBackingConfig> </GatewayBackingConfig> <GatewayInterfaces> </GatewayInterfaces> <EdgeGatewayServiceConfiguration> <FirewallService> </FirewallService> <NatService> </NatService> <GatewayIpsecVpnService> </GatewayIpsecVpnService> <StaticRoutingService> </StaticRoutingService> <LoadBalancerService> </LoadBalancerService> </EdgeGatewayServiceConfiguration> </Configuration> </EdgeGateway\\> This is the configuration that you'll need to amend prior to posting it back to your new edge. Depending on your specific configuration and requirements, different sections of the configuration may or may not require editing. Copy and paste all of this configuration into a text editor, for example Notepad++, for editing. Configuration that must be changed As you can see above, the edge XML configuration is split into each configurable item. When amending and applying the configuration, you may want to apply this section by section, rather than as a single XML block. Firewall and NAT rules When migrating configuration between edges, particularly when moving between regions, your external IP allocation will change. This means that any references to your externally assigned IP addresses within your edge configuration will need to be amended. You'll be assigned the same amount of external addresses as before, so we'd recommend pairing a new IP with each of your old IP addresses and then performing a find and replace to ensure all IPs are updated correctly. When you create NAT rules, they're applied to a single interface on the edge. Each interface is referenced within the configuration file as an href with its own interface ID. When applying the configuration to the new edge, these interface IDs will be different and will therefore need to be replaced. The interface name will also likely change. By exporting the configuration of the new edge as an XML file, you can identify the interface name and its href that the rules will need to be applied on. Providing you keep your private address ranges the same as your original environment, you should not need to make any changes to these within the new configuration. <NatService> <IsEnabled>true</IsEnabled> <NatRule> <Description></Description> <RuleType></RuleType> <IsEnabled></IsEnabled> <Id></Id> <GatewayNatRule> <Interface href=https://<api_url>/api/admin/network/<interface-id> name=\"nft00xxxxx\" type=\"application/vnd.vmware.admin.network+xml\" /> <OriginalIp>x.x.x.x</OriginalIp> <TranslatedIp>y.y.y.y</TranslatedIp> </GatewayNatRule> </NatRule> </NatService> VPNs and load balancers With your external IP allocation likely to change, this will also affect any configured VPNs and load balancers that you may have previously had on your original edge. For VPN configuration, you'll need to replace the interface references and names for your local networks. For the load balancer configuration, you'll need to replace the external network interface reference and name. As above, each of these interfaces have their own ID and href that you'll need to add to the new configuration. Exporting the XML configuration of the new edge will provide you with the required information for these new interfaces. Remember that when amending VPN configuration, and particularly the local endpoint IP address, you'll also need to make configuration changes on the peer side to mirror those amendments. If you're using a Pre-Shared Key (PSK) for IPsec VPN authentication, the key will not be exported as part of this configuration. You can retrieve the key either through the VMware Cloud Director GUI or by querying an additional API endpoint (see How to obtain full IPsec VPN configuration via the vCloud API ). Applying the new configuration When you've amended the configuration with the necessary elements of the new edge gateway, you can apply it to the edge gateway. To easily identify and resolve any possible issues when applying the configuration, posting the configuration to the edge in the individual configurable items may be easier. For example, apply the amended firewall rules, then apply the NAT rules and so on. The steps below outline how to apply the amended configuration to your new edge gateway: Enclose the new configuration in a pair of <EdgeGatewayServiceConfiguration> tags, for example: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?> <EdgeGatewayServiceConfiguration xmlns=\"http://www.vmware.com/vcloud/v1.5\"> <NatService> <IsEnabled>true</IsEnabled> <NatRule> <Description></Description> <RuleType></RuleType> <IsEnabled></IsEnabled> <Id></Id> <GatewayNatRule> <Interface href=https://<api_url>/api/admin/network/<interface-id> name=\"nft00xxxxx\" type=\"application/vnd.vmware.admin.network+xml\" /> <OriginalIp>x.x.x.x</OriginalIp> <TranslatedIp>y.y.y.y</TranslatedIp> </GatewayNatRule> </NatRule> </NatService> </EdgeGatewayServiceConfiguration> Copy and paste this configuration into the Request Body section of the RESTClient. From the Method list, select POST . Append the following to the URL of the new edge gateway in the URL field: /action/configureServices For example, if the original contents of the URL were: https://<api_url>/api/admin/edgeGateway/<id> The updated URL would be: https://<api_url>/api/admin/edgeGateway/<id>/action/configureServices You must also add another header to the RESTClient prior to submitting the new configuration. From the Headers menu at the top of the RESTClient select Custom Header . In the Name field, enter Content-Type . In the Attribute Value field enter the following: application/vnd.vmware.admin.edgeGatewayServiceConfiguration+xml Click Okay . To submit the new configuration, click Send . The status of the edge gateway as viewed from VMware Cloud Director will briefly show as Updating Configuration . Once this process has completed, click the edge gateway and select Configure Services . In the Configure Services window, verify that the configuration has been applied successfully.

    "keywords": "How to obtain full IPsec VPN configuration via the Cloud Director API Overview Due to changes in VMware Cloud Director and how edge configuration is stored and retrieved, the current documented process for retrieving the edge gateway configuration does not include the full IPsec VPN configuration, specifically the Pre-Shared Key (PSK). Through testing, UKCloud has identified how to obtain the full IPsec configuration, but unfortunately not as a single configuration file. You must obtain and query the IPsec VPN configuration separately. This article provides instructions on how to obtain the PSK of your configured IPsec VPNs on an edge gateway via the Cloud Director API. This can also be achieved via the VMware Cloud Director GUI. The PSK is not necessarily required when updating edge or VPN configuration. Changes in configuration to an existing VPN can be applied to an edge via the API without the PSK being present in the XML body. In this case, the PSK will remain unaltered. If you're configuring a new VPN or updating the PSK, then this information will need to be present in the XML body. For instructions on how to export, amend and post the configuration from one edge gateway to another, see How to migrate edge configuration data to another edge . Retrieving the edge gateway API endpoint Follow the instructions in How to migrate edge configuration data to another edge , up to and including Retrieving edge gateway configuration via the API . As per this section of the article, you should be able to retrieve the API endpoint of your edge gateway. For example: https://<api_url>/api/admin/edgeGateway/<edge_id> The endpoint you need to obtain the full IPsec configuration is slightly different to this, however, following this method you'll be able to retrieve the edge ID that you need. Append the edge ID to the following endpoint: https://<api_url>/network/edges/<edge_id> Obtaining edge gateway configuration Performing a GET request against the API endpoint shown in the previous section will return a more detailed configuration of your edge gateway, including additional parameters for your IPsec VPNs that weren't previously returned. However, the PSK will be obfuscated. To display the PSK, you need to amend the endpoint to only obtain the IPsec configuration and append an additional switch to display the sensitive data: https://<api_url>/network/edges/<edge_id>/ipsec/config?showSensitiveData=true A GET request against this endpoint should now return the full IPsec configuration, along with the PSK in plain text. Applying the new configuration Unfortunately, you cannot post this XML configuration back to an edge, and will also be unable to modify the edge via this API endpoint. You'll need to format your XML configuration and apply it as documented in the Modifying the IPsec VPN configuration and Applying the new configuration sections of How to change IPsec VPN settings via the Cloud Director API . As mentioned earlier in this article, you can post the VPN configuration to the edge without the PSK being present in the XML configuration. The PSK will remain the same. However, if you need to amend the PSK or configure a new VPN, you can find instructions for this in the Amending the shared secret section of the article linked above.

    "title": "How to migrate your workloads between UKCloud regions",
    "keywords": "How to migrate your workloads between UKCloud regions Overview Journaling Protection is a powerful, self-service replication and recovery tool that can help you improve your organisational resilience. However, you can also use UKCloud's Journaling Protection solution to migrate your UKCloud for VMware applications into a different UKCloud for VMware-enabled zone. This enables you to move your workloads into the regions within the UKCloud platform that are best suited for their requirements. Our workload migration service is powered by Zerto, a leading provider of disaster recovery software for the cloud. Note The migration of VMs within the UKCloud platform is very closely aligned to the disaster recovery of VMs within UKCloud; the small difference being that when you have failed-over the VMs from one region into another, you don't then failback to your primary region. As such, you'll find that the articles linked to from this article refer to disaster recovery and failover, however the steps also apply to migration. Intended audience To complete the steps in this article, you need to have access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal. Before you begin When you request Journaling Protection to migrate a workload within the UKCloud platform, UKCloud provides you with: A ZORG ID to identify your environment within Zerto Access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal (ZSSP), where you can create and manage your VPGs You should consider the following: Migration is provided on a vApp basis (not for individual VMs). This is worth considering if you intend to migrate only some parts of your vApps. VMs must be powered on to be synchronised prior to migration. Our Journaling Protection service option captures every action. When a VM is deleted from your vApp, the associated journal is also deleted. This means if you delete a VM before migrating it, that VM will not exist in your target region. We do not currently provide the option for you to create custom service profiles. Migrating workloads between UKCloud regions You begin the migration process for your VMs by adding Journaling Protection to the vApp that contains those VMs. This creates something called a virtual protection group (VPG). Each VM in the protected vApp is synchronised to the target migration region and a journal is created. After this initial synchronisation, each subsequent write operation to the VM is processed as normal on the source region and a copy is asynchronously sent to the target region and written to the journal. Each journal entry exists in the journal for a specified number of days (the journal history). When the journal history is reached, as new journal entries are created, older entries are written to the migration target VM's virtual disks. Every few seconds, a checkpoint is written to every journal for each VM in the VPG to ensure crash-consistency between the VMs. When you're ready to migrate a VM, you select a checkpoint to recover to. This isn't strictly necessary for workload migration, but is a feature associated with the Journaling Protection aspect of Zerto. It means that you'll have a known point at which the VM will be restarted from in the new region. During migration, the vApp and its VMs are created on the target region and the recovery disks for each VM are attached to the migrated VM. Information in the journal is then promoted to the VM to bring it up to the date and time of the selected checkpoint. The process for getting Journaling Protection up and running ready for workload migration within the UKCloud platform is as follows: Create a migration VDC Configure networking in the migration target VDC Create a virtual protection group in the primary region Perform a test migration Migrate your workloads Create a migration VDC To migrate your workloads to a different UKCloud region, you must have a VDC in the intended target region. If you already have a compute service in the target region, you can use an existing VDC or you can create a new one using: The UKCloud Portal (see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware ) The UKCloud Portal API (see How to use the UKCloud Portal API ) If you don't already have a compute service in the target region or you'd prefer UKCloud to create the VDC for you, you can request this as part of your Journaling Protection service request. Configure networking in the migration target VDC You must configure any internally and externally routed networks in your migration target environment to duplicate those in the source region. You must also configure the edge gateway with the same firewall, NAT and other rules. You'll create the mapping between these networks when you create your VPG (see How to create a virtual protection group ). When you initially migrate your workloads, external access to the target region will be via a different IP address. If you want to keep the same IP addresses for your new environment, you'll need to request an IP move from UKCloud. We'll move the IPs from your old edge to your new edge. Note that you should raise this service request in good time so we can move the IPs as soon as you need us to. Alternatively, you can use the new allocation of IP addresses in your new environment. You don't need to configure vApp networks in advance as they'll be replicated within the VPG. Create a virtual protection group in the primary region A VPG is a collection of VMs that are grouped together for migration. As workload migration within the UKCloud platform uses Journaling Protection, VPGs are created from vApps. When you create a VPG, you specify the vApp you want to migrate and all the VMs in that vApp are replicated. For example, in a standard three-tier application, you'll likely have three VMs: one for your application, one for the database and one for the web server. As best practice, you should create these three related VMs in a single vApp, which you can then add to a VPG so that all the VMs are migrated together. For more information, see How to create a virtual protection group (this article is the same for failovers and migrations). Tip For migration between regions, use the Migration to the Cloud 1 Day Retention service profile. Perform a test migration After you create your VPG, we recommend that you perform a test migration to confirm that your VMs will be recovered correctly when you do the real migration. For more information, see How to perform a failover (this article is the same for failovers and migrations). Migrate your workloads If you're happy with your test migration, you can now choose when to migrate your environment from your primary region into your new region. You don't have to migrate everything in one go; you can choose which VPGs you migrate and you can perform a staged migration. Within Zerto, you have two options for migrating your workloads: Move the VPG to the target region. This method performs an end-to-end migration, including removing the VMs from the source region after they've been moved. For more information, see the steps below. Perform a live migration. This method provides more flexibility for you to control what happens in the primary region after you move the VMs to the target region. For more information, see How to perform a failover . To move a VPG: Log in to ZSSP . Use the ZSSP login link for the zone in which your target VDC is located. At the bottom of the page, select Move , then VPG . In the Move wizard, on the Select VPGs page, select one or more VPGs that you want to move then click Next . Note When you move a VPG, you cannot select which checkpoint to use. Zerto uses the most recent checkpoint. On the Execute Parameters page, the commit policy gives you the opportunity to check the integrity of the migrated VMs before committing the move. To change the commit policy, click the Commit Policy field and select: Auto-Commit if you want to automatically commit the move after a specified amount of time if there is no user interaction. Set the amount of time in the After field, up to a maximum of 1440 minutes (24 hours). If you want the move to be immediately committed, enter 0. Auto-Rollback if you want to automatically roll back the move after a specified amount of time if there is no user interaction. Set the amount of time in the After field, up to a maximum of 1440 minutes (24 hours). If you want the move to be immediately rolled back, enter 0. None if you do not want to apply a commit policy. You must manually commit or roll back the move. The source VMs must be powered off before they can be migrated. If the VMs cannot be gracefully shut down, you can force a shutdown. To force shutdown, select the Force Shutdown check box. If you do not select this option and the VMs cannot be gracefully shut down, the move process fails. Reverse protection ensures that when the source VMs are migrated to the target region, the source region becomes the new target region. Reverse protection is enabled by default, but you should disable it by clicking the Reverse Protection field and deselecting the Reverse check box. Click Next . On the Move page, review the diagram to see the number of VPGs and VMs included in the move and where they'll be moved to, then click Start Move . The move process creates the VMs in the target region. Note If a VM already exists on the target region with the same name as one of the source VMs, a number is added to the end of the target VM name to ensure that it is unique. If you set a commit policy with a time greater than zero, you can check the integrity of the migrated VMs before committing (or rolling back) the migration. When you've finished testing, you can either wait for the time to elapse before the auto commit or auto rollback, or on the VPGs tab, click the VPG Name and then click the Commit or Rollback icon as required. After the migrated VMs are up and running and committed in the target region, the powered off VMs in the source region are removed from the source region and data from the journal is promoted to the migrated VMs. You should have disabled reverse protection to stop your migrated VMs from being protected on the source region. Next steps After you've completed the migration, you can continue working with your applications as before. If you used failover to migrate your workloads, when you've determined that the migration has been successful, you should remove the original VMs from the source region to remove any workloads that are no longer required. You can use Journaling Protection to protect your newly migrated VMs by replicating to another region within UKCloud. Note While you can set up Journaling Protection for migration purposes in regions 1 and 2, the target environment for Journaling Protection for failover is available only in regions 5 and 6.

Inbound ports TCP ports UDP ports VPN ports SSH - 22 DNS - 53 AH SMTP - 25 ESP HTTP - 80 and 8080 IPsec - UDP 4500 HTTPS - 443, 444 and 8443 ISAKMP --- UDP 500 Secure SMTP - 465 FTPS (Control) - 990 IMAPS - 993 POP3S - 995 Outbound ports TCP ports UDP ports VPN ports SSH - 22 DNS --- 53 AH SMTP - 25 NTP - 123 ESP HTTP -80 and 8080 IPsec - UDP 4500 HTTPS - 443, 444 and 8443 ISAKMP - UDP 500 Secure SMTP - 465 FTPS (Data) - 989 Connectivity By default the Assured data upload PC is connected to your environment's internet gateway. You can connect from the PC to an external IP in your environment. The IP address of the data upload pc can be added to a firewall rule in your environment to secure access Access to environments on other networks (e.g HSCN or PSN) will require additional configuration. Please discuss this with your Service Delivery Manager if required Platform performance The speed of data transfer to the UKCloud platform isn't guaranteed. However, during tests of the upload and download speeds, an average of 8 Mbit/s was achieved for VM import/export and 40 Mbit/s for data transferred over FTPS. For a transfer time calculator, go to https://techinternets.com/copy_calc?do . If you use FTPS to upload data to or download it from your environment, you can transfer up to 1TB of data in a day. Anticipated transfer speeds Transfer speeds will vary based on a number of factors such as the protocol being used or the system being targeted. The following table can help you calculate the time required to upload data based on estimated speeds derived from our testing and simulations: Upload type Protocol Estimated transfer speed vCloud VM import SSL 8 Mbit/s vCloud data store file upload SSL 8 Mbit/s vCloud multi-threaded upload SSL 16 Mbit/s File upload to virtual machine SCP 20 Mbit/s FTPS 40 Mbit/s FTP 40 Mbit/s If the Data Transfer Facility doesn't provide the performance you need, you can engage a Cloud Architect to discuss other options.

    "keywords": "Mass Transfer Facility - Service Scope About the facility You can use UKCloud's Mass Transfer Facility to move virtualised environments into and out of your UKCloud environment using your own network attached storage (NAS) device, hard disk drives (HDDs) or USB drives. You can use the Mass Transfer Facility to move: Into or out of your UKCloud environment Between the Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL security domains Between our data centres in Farnborough and Corsham For example, it's useful if you don't have enough network bandwidth for large transfers, or if you don't have a Cross Domain Security Zone (CDSZ) service in place. NAS Your NAS is securely installed in the mass transfer bay and connected into your UKCloud environment. HDD Your HDD is securely installed in an eSATA enclosure and connected to our NAS device in the mass transfer bay. Our NAS is connected into your UKCloud environment to carry out the transfer. Your HDD must be compatible with our eSATA enclosure: 3.5\" SATA NAS hard drive, optimised for use in one to five-bay enclosures and formatted as NTFS, Fat32, EXT3, EXT4 or HFS Plus (exFat is not currently supported). USB Your USB is connected to our NAS device in the mass transfer bay. Our NAS is connected into your UKCloud environment to carry out the transfer. Scheduling your transfer To schedule a transfer, raise a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal, providing us with at least 10 days' notice. You should also arrange delivery of your device to the UKCloud office, quoting the Service Request number, no later than the working day before the scheduled transfer day. When raising the Service Request, provide as much information as possible. For example, for UKCloud for VMware environments, provide: The number of VMs and their total size Details of the originating VDC and data centre (if applicable) Details of the originating vApp (if applicable) Details of the target VDC and vApp (if applicable) The data centre location If using a NAS device for the transfer, also provide: The make and model of the NAS Login credentials for the NAS, so that we can configure it for the transfer Network connection details (IPs) to connect to the device Before sending us your device Your SIRO, compliance officer or other person responsible for your IT security must provide confirmation that your device is free of any viruses or malware. We'll send you a form to fill in and send back to us by email before sending the NAS, HDD or USB, to ensure there are no issues ahead of its delivery. Booking conditions This service is based on the transfer of whole artifacts, for example VMs, not individual files. For UKCloud for VMware, your VMs can be in OVF or OVA format. The hardware version must be 11 or lower and you need to remove any network cards and any mounted media files, such as ISOs, from the VM's hardware configuration prior to the creation of the OVA or OVF file. Use of the Mass Transfer Facility is charged per the current SFIA Rate Card , based on the Enable rate. You'll only be billed for the time it takes for the engineer to set up, manage and detach the device. Due to the nature of the service and the time to transfer data, you won't be charged for the time it takes to transfer the data. We reserve the right to add additional charges should any remediation work be required during the process. The minimum charge is half of a business day. Anticipated transfer speeds Artifacts are transferred to and from your UKCloud environment over a 1 GB connection running at approximately 110 Mbps. We've established that it's quicker to upload and download many smaller artifacts, rather than fewer large ones. Artifacts will be put into batches that can be completed during the business day. This will continue until the transfer is completed. After transfer completion Once we've transferred your artifacts into or out of your environment in the format that they arrived in, it's your responsibility to set up / reconfigure your environment in the way you want to use it. This includes, for example, networking, templates and catalogues. We'll contact you to check that the transfer has been successful before we remove the device from the enclosure and advise you when you can arrange to collect your device.

    "title": "Smart Hands Service Scope",
    "keywords": "Smart Hands Service Scope About this service UKCloud offers a Smart Hands service, available for customers using our Cloud Enablement service. You can use this service for a number of different requirements, such as a physical 'push-button' task, replacing hardware or checking the status of equipment. This service is subject to the availability of UKCloud engineers to perform the work. UKCloud reserves the right to turn down or reschedule requests where they conflict with other planned or emergency work, or are outside the scope of the Smart Hands service. We'll communicate with you if this happens. Inclusions The following are examples of the core tasks that Smart Hands can be requested for: Visual inspection or verification of status, for example checking and relaying whether an equipment LED is lit, or information a display panel is presenting Install customer hardware Physical power cycle of equipment Toggle a switch or push a button Replacement of existing equipment Check and/or re-seat cables Confirm a serial number or other printed information on equipment where visible Connectivity testing Supervising customer provided third-party installations and visits Basic troubleshooting of customer equipment Note The Smart Hands service is available only within the data centre halls and cannot be used for transportation of hardware between different areas of the data centre. UKCloud can assist with uninstalling and moving equipment to loading bays but cannot transport equipment between different areas of the data centre. How do I use Smart Hands? Step 1: Raise a Service Request/Incident For routine non-urgent requirements, raise a Service Request in the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal providing your detailed needs of the activity you would like us to perform and if there are any specific needs to be co-ordinated with you. For urgent requirements following raising a Service Request and contact UKCloud Support on 01252 303300, option 2 . We will treat your urgent request as a Service Down event and act to help resolve as quickly as possible. Step 2: Confirm requirements If the instructions in the Service Request are unclear, you will be contacted by an Engineer to confirm your requirements before the activity is performed or in the case of hardware being installed or replaced, to establish when the hardware will be delivered and the potential installation date subject to the hardware arriving on time. All hardware deliveries must be co-ordinated with us to ensure they are accepted by the data centre. Your non-urgent requirements such as installing new hardware, will be carried out during our business hours - 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday and won't be possible during public holidays or our published Change Freeze periods. An estimation of the time it will take to complete the activity will be provided. Step 3: Carry out task A Data Centre Engineer will carry out the task based on the instructions received. The length of time that the activity takes is dependent on the task being undertaken, and the Data Centre Engineer may call the requestor on their registered number if any further information is required. Step 4: Confirm task completion Once the task requested has been completed, the Engineer will contact you to confirm the work is completed successfully. The Service Request will be updated to show that that the task has been completed and the duration of the activity before closing the ticket. Smart Hands Standby If you need to reserve a UKCloud engineer to perform Smart Hands work during a time window, but do not know specficially when the engineer will be required within that window, you can use Smart Hands Standby. For example, you may need to power-cycle colocated hardware at random times during an overnight upgrade. With Smart Hands Standby, you can reserve a UKCloud engineer for an 8-hour window to be on call to perform tasks as required. Smart Hands Standby is charged at the SFIA Rate 'Follow – Client Interface'. This is in addition to the standard Smart Hands hourly rate, which is applied when the engineer is performing the activities. In the event that the reserved engineer is required to perform emergency maintenance for UKCloud during the Smart Hands Standby window, this will take priority over the on-call reservation. In the event this happens we'll communicate this to you and we'll make best efforts to accomodate your work during the emergency maintenance. How much does Smart Hands cost? The cost for Smart Hands is charged in hourly increments at a rate of £85 per hour with a minimum of 1 hour. You will be charged to cover the time the engineer is on site to carry out the required activity and this charge will appear on your next invoice.

    "keywords": "Data Transfer between Assured and Elevated Service Scope About this document This document describes the boundaries of the UKCloud Data Transfer between Assured and Elevated service, along with the division of responsibilities between UKCloud and the customer, to facilitate the provisioning and ongoing use of the service. About Data Transfer between Assured and Elevated The Data Transfer between Assured and Elevated service enables customers to move their workloads between the Assured and Elevated security domains to better meet data sensitivity requirements. Due to the enhanced sensitivity of data and workloads on the Elevated domain, and the restriction on connectivity, we use the UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone (CDSZ) service to facilitate this transfer. Application process Customers wanting to transfer data between the Assured and Elevated security domains will only be required to complete their own self-assessment in order to ensure that technical controls, compliance and security assurance are implemented to protect their data and workloads. To commence the service, there is a ticket template available under service requests within My Calls. Complete the template, and this will be used to create the transfer environment for you to use. Implementation To transfer data between the Assured and Elevated domains, customers must use a CDSZ Walled Garden to create and manage the virtual machines (VMs) required to perform the transfer using the technology and application services of their choice. The figure below shows an example of a possible setup, but it should be used as a starting point only; you may want to populate your walled garden with more services to meet your needs. Service architecture UKCloud will provide access to a CDSZ environment for the transfer of data between the security domains. A CDSZ Walled Garden is a VMware only environment, utilizing VMware Cloud Director as the management orchestrator for the service. For additional information regarding the CDSZ, see the Service Scope . The actual CDSZ service will be provided without charge for the transfer of data, with the following restrictions: The service is free of charge for the first 10 working days. After working 10 days, the service will be charged as per the standard CDSZ pricing in the UKCloud Pricing Guide . The 10-day free-of-charge service is available only for single site applications. For dual or cross-site applications, there will be an additional charge as per the CDSZ price matrix in the UKCloud Pricing Guide . There is no Service Level Agreement for this service. Customers utilising this service will not qualify for Service Credits due to unavailability or loss of performance during the transfer. Customers are responsible for the setting up of the applications within their service to facilitate the transfer. If required, UKCloud can provide assistance via our Professional Services team, which can be arranged via your Service Delivery Manager. A CDSZ Walled Garden provides a virtual data centre (VDC) in which you can build VMs and virtual networks to inspect and protect data moving between Assured and Elevated security domains.

About Data Transfer - Region to Region The Data Transfer – Region to Region service enables customers to move their UKCloud for VMware workloads between regions on the UKCloud platform. To complete this task as efficiently as possible, we utilise the Zerto recovery tool as it's already implemented and tested on the platform for data migration and restoration. Note This service is specifically designed for UKCloud for VMware workloads that are Zerto-enabled. Application process Customers wanting to transfer UKCloud for VMware workloads between regions on the UKCloud platform will need to raise a service request for the Zerto tool to be implemented in their environment. To commence the service, raise a Service Request within the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. Implementation To transfer UKCloud for VMware workloads between regions, customers must use the Zerto recovery tool, which will be provisioned and set up for their use to transfer the workloads. This tool is made available free of charge for 10 working days for the migration only. Zerto is also available for UKCloud for VMware workloads for Journaling Protection at additional cost – which is outside of the functionality provided for this specific Data Transfer - Region to Region service. Important While the data transfer service is free of charge for 10 working days, customers will be charged for all compute and storage resources that are consumed in both the source and target regions. It is the customer's responsibility to ensure that the compute and storage in the source region is deleted once the transfer is complete in order to avoid unnecessary charges. Service architecture UKCloud will provide access to the Zerto recovery tool for the transfer of data between regions. Currently, Zerto is only enabled for UKCloud for VMware and will be provisioned for the purpose of transfer only between specific regions. Note that there is no functionality to transfer to region 1 or region 2. Workloads can only be transferred to regions 5,6,7 and 8. Also note that this is dependent on the security domain of the source region as this service can only be used to transfer workloads between: Assured to Assured region Elevated to Elevated region If you need to transfer workloads between security domains (Assured and Elevated), then you'll need to use the Data Transfer between Assured and Elevated service . The actual Zerto transfer service will be provided without charge for the transfer of workloads, with the following restrictions: The service is free of charge for the first 10 working days. After 10 working days, the service will be charged as per the standard Journaling Protection costs in the UKCloud Pricing Guide . Customers are required to inform UKCloud via a service request to confirm that the transfer is complete. The service will then be stopped, which will prevent further billing. There is no Service Level Agreement for this service. Customers utilising this service will not qualify for Service Credits due to unavailability or loss of performance during the transfer. Once the Zerto tool has been provisioned, customers are responsible for the selection of VMs and data, and the actual transfer. If required, UKCloud can provide assistance via our Professional Services team, which can be arranged via your Service Delivery Manager. The How to migrate your workloads between UKCloud regions article on the Knowledge Centre provides all the information you'll require to understand the tool as well as configuration details and step-by-step instructions.

    "keywords": "Anti-Virus as a Service FAQs Service What is the service? As customer solutions start to expand beyond their own data centres into embracing the benefits of leveraging multi-cloud, the day-to-day management and control of anti-virus and endpoint protection across various technology stacks and locations become highly complex and resource intensive. Anti-Virus as a Service helps to reduce these challenges, whilst increasing your level of trust and confidence in the security health of of your solution stack. Anti-Virus as a Service provides you with the confidence that your environments are protected from the dangers of viruses and malware, all without the usual headaches associated with the deployment, management and operation of an anti-virus solution. What technologies do you use? Building on the capabilities of our Managed Monitoring as a Service , UKCloud uses the industry-leading endpoint security platform SentinelOne as the engine for Anti-Virus as a Service, harnessing the power of machine learning to providing protection that goes beyond that of traditional anti-virus or anti-malware solutions. For further details as to how we leverage SentinelOne as an approved third party in the delivery of this service, see the Anti-Virus as a Service Service Scope . What actions will UKCloud perform on positive detection? Our service uses the following two detection types: Detection Type Description Default Actions Malicious SentinelOne has detected a file or process as being harmful Quarantine the affected file Notify the customer Suspicious SentinelOne has detected a file or process as having the potential to be harmful Notify the customer Take no action on the affected file How do I get alerted on events? All alerting will be performed via a support ticket or any special escalation process agreed between UKCloud and the customer. How does UKCloud provide urgent maintenance notifications and incident reports? We don't envisage any scenarios that prevent UKCloud from meeting the Anti-Virus as a Service platform availability KPI defined within the Service Scope for this service. Current Service Status and past incident reports are published on the UKCloud Service Status page . Note Should the central Anti-Virus as a Service platform become unavailable, any SentinelOne agents installed locally to the endpoint will remain active and continue to provide protection. About SentinelOne What is SentinelOne? The SentinelOne Singularity platform is an industry-first data lake that seamlessly fuses together the data, access, control and integration planes of its endpoint protection (EPP), endpoint detection and response (EDR), IoT security and cloud workload protection (CWPP) into a centralised platform. How good is SentinelOne? SentinelOne is regularly apprised by industry-leading analyst firms and independent third-party testing such as: Gartner Best Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Solutions as Reviewed by Customers. Gartner Best Endpoint Protection Platforms (EPP) as Reviewed by Customers. SentinelOne received 100% ratings across all testing categories in Protection Accuracy, Legitimate Accuracy and Total Accuracy in SE Labs's Breach Response Test . MITRE ATT&CK APT29 report: SentinelOne Singularity Platform had the highest number of combined high-quality detections and the highest number of automated correlations. SentinelOne grouped all data over the 3-day MITRE test into a mere 11 console alerts, with each alert containing all the details within. Fewer alerts in the Management console are better than more alerts, and Singularity successfully grouped together relevant related data, context and correlation, making it easier for analysts to understand and act. SentinelOne had the highest number of tool-only detections and the highest number of human/MDR detections. Analysts are drowning in data and simply aren't able to keep up with sophisticated attack vectors. SentinelOne helps turn data into stories, so analysts can focus on the alerts that matter most. Which certifications does SentinelOne have? SentinelOne participates in a variety of testing and has won awards. The most recent third-party tests and awards include: MITRE ATT&CK APT29 report: Highest number of combined high-quality detections and the highest number of automated correlations, highest number of tool-only detections and the highest number of human/MDR detections. The first and only Next Gen cybersecurity solution to receive VB100 certification from Virus Bulletin. The VB100 certification is a well-respected recognition in the anti-virus and malware communities due to its stringent testing requirements. Gartner Best Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Solutions as Reviewed by Customers. Gartner Best Endpoint Protection Platforms (EPP) as Reviewed by Customers. Passmark's January 2019 performance test compares SentinelOne to several legacy AV products. Testing showed that SentinelOne performs better than other vendors when the agent is under heavy load. During normal user workload, customers typically see less than 5% CPU load. Endpoint security What is endpoint security software? Endpoint security software is a program that is installed on laptops, desktops and/or servers that protects them from the slew of attacks that can infect an endpoint – malware, exploits, live attacks, script-based attacks, and more – with the purpose of stealing data, profiting financially or otherwise harming systems, individuals or organizations. Is endpoint security the same as anti-virus? Endpoint security solution is not an anti-virus. Anti-virus is an antiquated, legacy technology that relies on malware file signatures. SentinelOne Endpoint Security does not use traditional anti-virus signatures to spot malicious attacks. Instead, it uses a combination of static machine learning analysis and dynamic behavioral analysis to protect systems. All files are evaluated in real time before they execute and as they execute. Because SentinelOne technology does not use signatures, you don't have to worry about network intensive updates or local system I/O intensive daily disk scans. SentinelOne provides \"Next Gen endpoint protection\". What is this? Next Gen endpoint security solutions are proactive. They preempt and predict threats in a number of ways. By evaluating all activity in a network, both in the kernel and in user space, these tools keep a close eye on anything that looks suspicious. Machine learning processes are proficient at predicting where an attack will occur. Security tools may use things like out-of-band monitoring to make the surveillance more robust and to catch viruses, malware and other kinds of attacks early. What detection capabilities does SentinelOne have? SentinelOne utilises multiple cascading engines: reputation, StaticAI and ActiveEDR capabilities to prevent and detect different types of attacks at different phases. Detection - Patented Behavioral AI recognizes malicious actions regardless of vector. SentinelOne is the only endpoint security vendor to detect fileless, zero-day and nation-grade attacks in real time. Prevention - Static AI on the endpoint prevents attacks inline in real time. Consistently ranked for highest efficacy and lowest false-positives, SentinelOne's static AI model replaces legacy antivirus. Does SentinelOne provide malware prevention? SentinelOne is designed to prevent all kinds of attacks, including those from malware. SentinelOne's Endpoint Prevention (EPP) component uses StaticAI Prevention to analyse (online or offline) executable files pre-execution; this replaces the need for traditional signatures, which are easily bypassed, require constant updating and require resource-intensive scans on the device. The SentinelOne engine also performs analysis of PDF, Microsoft OLE documents (legacy MS Office) and MS Office XML formats (modern MS Office) as well as other kinds of files that may contain executable code. The goal of StaticAI in the product is to detect commodity and some novel malware with a compact, on-agent machine learning model that serves as a substitute for the large signature databases used in legacy AV products. Can SentinelOne detect in-memory attacks? SentinelOne can detect in-memory attacks. SentinelOne is integrated with hardware-based Intel® Threat Detection Technology (Intel TDT) for accelerated Memory Scanning capabilities. Will the SentinelOne agent slow down my endpoints? The SentinelOne agent does not slow down the endpoint on which it is installed. The SentinelOne agent is designed to have as little impact on the end user as possible while still providing effective protection both online and offline. In contrast to other anti-malware products that require constant .dat file signature updates and daily disk scans, the agent instead uses static file AI and behavioral AI, which saves on CPU, memory and disk I/O. End users have better computer performance as a result. System resource consumption will vary depending on system workload. Management How do I access my Anti-Virus as a Service environment? As it is assumed UKCloud will manage all anti-virus aspects as part of this service, there is currently no environment for customers to access. How do I manage my services? As it is assumed UKCloud will manage all anti-virus aspects as part of this service, there is currently no way for a customer to directly manage this service. Any changes to the service for items such as file or folder exclusions should be requested initially by raising a ticket within the My Calls section of the Portal. Alternatively, you can contact UKCloud Support by phone or email. How do I instantiate a manual or scheduled scan? Unlike traditional anti-virus solutions, SentinelOne's real-time AI threat recognition capabilities prevents viruses from embedding themselves into systems, removing the traditional concept of ad-hoc full system scans. Do I get access to a dashboard or reports? As it is assumed UKCloud will manage all anti-virus aspects as part of this service, there are currently no dashboard or reporting features for customers to access. Support How do I raise a support ticket? The secure online UKCloud Portal provides most common service management functionality. You can raise tickets within the My Calls section of the Portal.

There are no termination costs for this service. Security Do I need to install an agent on my endpoints to enable this service? Yes, you'll need to deploy the SentinelOne agent to each endpoint so that it can run autonomously on each device, without reliance on an internet connection. The agent sits at the kernel level and monitors all processes in real time. This process is performed by the agent's Dynamic Behavioral Tracking engine, and enables users to see exactly what happened on an endpoint at each stage of execution. This includes origin, patient zero, process and file activity, registry event, network connections and forensic data. How is any data related to this service kept secure? UKCloud will deploy and manage all agents used to deliver this service, with all traffic being passed via HTTPS. Any customer data that UKCloud collects as part of this service will never leave a UKCloud data centre or be shared with a third party. Is there a protective monitoring service?

    "title": "Patching as a Service FAQs",
    "keywords": "Patching as a Service FAQs Service What is the service? As customer solutions start to expand beyond their own data centres into embracing the benefits of leveraging multi-cloud, the day-to-day management and control of operating system (OS) patching across various technology stacks and locations become highly complex and resource intensive. Patching as a Service helps to reduce these challenges, whilst increasing your level of trust and confidence in the security health of any operating systems deployed as part of your solution stack. With Patching as a Service, we provide routine OS patch management for compute instances deployed across UKCloud's multi-cloud. It helps you accelerate business value by removing the burden of basic OS hygiene, letting you focus your attention above the operating system. What technologies do you use? Built on the capabilities of our Managed Monitoring as a Service , UKCloud uses a combination of patches released directly by the vendor coupled with Ivanti Security Controls , a market-leading enterprise patch management and control solution, as the key technologies to deliver Patching as a Service. Do I get access to a dashboard or reports? As it is assumed UKCloud will manage all patching aspects as part of this service, there are currently no dashboard or reporting features for customers to access. How do I get alerted on events? All alerting will be performed via a support ticket or any special escalation process agreed between UKCloud and the customer. How does UKCloud provide urgent maintenance notifications and incident reports? We do not envisage any scenarios that prevent UKCloud in meeting the availability KPI defined within the Service Scope for this service. Current Service Status reports and past incident reports are published on the UKCloud Service Status page . What type of patches will be applied? For Microsoft operating systems we'll scan for and recommend applying any patches classified by Microsoft as being 'Security Patches' of any severity (Critical to Low). Additional patches for items such as 'Feature Packs' or general driver updates are excluded from this service. For Linux operating systems we'll scan for and recommend applying any packages that have an update available in the repositories specified within the guest operating system (equivalent to manually running a yum update list command in RHEL or CentOS). How does the patching cycle work? OS vendors such as Microsoft release updates for their operating systems and associated packages in two ways: To a specific schedule: \"Patch Tuesday\" / \"Update Tuesday\" Ad-hoc, throughout the course of each month As such, any patching cycle needs to take into consideration the two potential release mechanisms for updates. For our Patching as a Service, we use a batch approach with specific cut-off dates, which we consider to be the best approach to maintain consistency in UKCloud's service, provide a good level of responsiveness to patch releases and also to insulate sufficiently against erroneous upstream vendor patches or errors. This means that there's a specific cut-off after which point any patches released will not be included in that cycle (see Windows Patches vs Linux Package Updates ). Rather being a limitation, this ensures that we can correctly and efficiently track activities when dealing with customer VMs. The following diagram shows the six available cut-off dates and associated Device Groups (Device Group A to J) that customers can choose to group patch some or all of their VMs: Note Patching cycle is two weeks long (dates above show day number from beginning of each cycle rather than day of month). Customers are advised to use Device Groups A to E to test patches on VMs within a representative non-production environment. Customers are advised to use Device Groups F to J to apply patches on VMs within their production environments on the basis that no issues ave been identified in their non-production environments. Does my server/virtual machine need to be powered-on for the patching service to run? For the patching service to operate correctly, VMs must be in a powered-on and available state throughout the patching schedule selected by the customer. The patching service is currently unable to change the power state of any server or virtual machine ahead of the selected patching schedule. Any server or VM in a powered-off state during the selected patching schedule will not be scanned for missing patches or have missing patches applied. Why are virtual appliances excluded from the scope of this service? Due to the tightly coupled nature of the operating system and application created when a vendor releases a virtual appliance, there's a high risk of corruption of the virtual appliance and its service availability should standard operating system patches be applied. This risk becomes even greater should a vendor modify the operating system a virtual appliance is based upon, something which is outside of UKCloud's control. How do I recover from applying a patch that may have had an adverse effect on my environment? Before applying patches within a production environment, it is the customer's responsibility to test those patches in a representative non-production environment to detect any potential adverse impact within the production environment. For customers using Patching as a Service on our UKCloud for VMware platform, UKCloud will endeavour to create a recovery point of a VM immediately prior to applying patches. As we cannot guarantee the creation of a recovery point (for example, open files may block the creation of a recovery point), UKCloud provides the following options for customers to choose from to determine how Patching as a Service should proceed should the creation of a recovery point fail: Hard (default option): The patching system will attempt to snapshot the virtual machine prior to applying any patches. If the snapshot is unsuccessful, patching will not proceed. Soft: The patching system will attempt to snapshot the virtual machine prior to applying any patches. If the snapshot is unsuccessful, patching will still proceed. Disabled: The patching system will not attempt to snapshot the virtual machine prior to applying any patches. This option is for virtual machines not running on the UKCloud VMware platform, or for virtual machines that are unable to have snapshots taken. UKCloud will retain any successful recovery points for a maximum of 48 hours, therefore it is essential that customers check for any potential issues within 48 hours of any patches being applied. Windows patches vs Linux package updates There are major differences between the way that Microsoft releases patches for its Windows OSs and the way that most Linux distribution vendors provide updates. The key difference is: Microsoft releases patches for their OS (which can be either critical or recommended) Linux vendors release patches for individual packages that make up the OS. To make best use of existing tooling within those Linux distributions, our service will update a package rather than an individual patch (for example, the equivalent of running yum update httpd , which will include all patches related to the httpd package). What if the application of a patch fails? Each patching window is followed by 18 hours of issue resolution time, in which issues during automatic patching are investigated and may involve actions such as manual application of patches, and so on. Following the end of this window, the customer will be contacted by UKCloud Support with the current state. If more time is required, this will be arranged at that point. What if I require additional patches outside of my standard patching cycle? The customer is responsible for notifying UKCloud of any patches (including critical patches) they require to be applied outside of their standard patching cycle via the My Calls section of the Portal. UKCloud will not proactively scan for or apply any patches outside of a customer's standard patching cycle. Should a customer raise a Service Request for patches to be applied outside of their standard patching cycle, our standard Service Request resolution target will apply, with the clock starting from the point we receive the Service Request and a vendor released patch being made publicly available. Prerequisites Operating systems UKCloud will only support in-life, vendor-backed operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Canonical Ubuntu. Customer-built operating systems (for example Gentoo Linux custom build) are unsupported by this service. Customer environment configuration General - For UKCloud to correctly scan for and apply OS patches, the customer must agree to enabling and configuring the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol by ensuring ports 445 and 139 (both over TCP) are open on all virtual machines and associated operating systems opted-in to this service. Linux Only - To provide secure communication between UKCloud's centralised patch management platform and a customer's virtual machine, we use key-based SSH sessions, reducing the need to share credentials. As such, we'll need the following prerequisites to be fulfilled on each virtual machine subscribing to this service: An allow rule for port 22 (SSH) on your virtual machine's firewall (for example, iptables). A local user account with passwordless sudo access. You'll need to share details of this account with UKCloud when onboarding to this service. UKCloud will provide you with a public SSH key during the onboarding process. You'll need to append this key to the authorized_keys file, located at ~/.ssh/authorized_keys within the home directory of the user you created in the step above.

    "title": "How to configure a VPN to enable monitoring of OpenStack instances with Managed Monitoring as a Service",
    "keywords": "How to configure a VPN to enable Monitoring of OpenStack instances with Managed Monitoring as a Service Overview To enable monitoring of your OpenStack instances using Managed Monitoring as a Service, you must stand up an OpenStack instance containing either a VPN appliance or an operating system with a VPN application installed. We recommend using pfSense as it has been tried and tested on the UKCloud platform. This article shows how to set up pfSense as a VPN to use for monitoring OpenStack instances. Installing and configuring pfSense The steps for installing and configuring pfSense are: Create a pfSense image . Set up the network . Attach the network to the router . Apply security groups . Deploy the VPN instance . Configure networking for the VPN endpoint . Configure the VPN endpoint . Creating a pfSense image To obtain the latest pfSense image, raise a service request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. In the OpenStack Horizon dashboard, expand Compute then select Images . Click the Create Image button. In the Create Image dialog box, in the Image Name field, enter an appropriate name for the image, for example, pfSense2.4.4_http . In the File field, click Browse and locate the pfSense image. From the Format list, select QCOW2 - QEMU Emulator . In the Minimum Disk field, enter 60 . Click Create Image . Setting up the network We recommend creating a new network for the VPN to reside on.

In the Create Network dialog box, provide the following information: Networks tab: Network Name: Enter VPN Bridge or something similar. Don't change any of the remaining options. Subnet tab: Subnet Name: Leave blank. Network Address: The network subnet in a CIDR format. The subnet should not already be in use and the subnet mask should be x.x.x.0/28 . IP Version: Select IPv4 . Gateway IP: The IP dedicated to the gateway of the network. For ease of use, use the network address but ensure that the last octet is a .1 , for example, 192.168.0.1 . Subnet Details tab: DNS Name Servers: Enter 8.8.8.8 or your preferred DNS server. Click Create . Attaching the network to the router The next step is to attach the network to the router. Expand Network then select Network Topology . Hover over the internet router and click Add Interface . In the Add Interface * dialog box, provide the following information: Subnet: Select the network the VPN will sit on. IP Address: Leave this blank so the gateway address you picked in the previous step will be chosen. Click Submit . Applying security groups You'll need to apply security groups to the VPN server to be able to talk to the other side. Expand Network then select Security Groups . Click the Create Security Group button. In the Create Security Group dialog box, in the Name field, enter UKCloud IT Operations VPN then click Create . Apply the following security group rules, where the Remote IP Prefix is your peer endpoint, as provided by UKCloud. Create a second security group with the name SSH & Web Access with the following rules, where the Remote IP Prefix is your public IP address and the Port Range is 443 and 22 (HTTPS and SSH). This enables you to access the pfSense console and web GUI. Create a third security group with the name Managed Monitoring Ports . The rules for this security group allow the UKCloud IT Operations subnet to communicate with the ports that are required to be monitored as specified in the MITO Data Capture Form. You must also allow ICMP to and from the local and peer subnets. The Ingress entry IP address must be the UKCloud IT Operations subnet, which will be provided by UKCloud. The Egress entry IP address must be the required monitored subnet(s), which are specified in the MITO Data Capture form. If you have opted for UKCloud Patching as a Service you must also create an additional security group with the name Managed Patching Ports . The rules for this security group allow the UKCloud IT Operations subnet to communicate through the VPN to patch the machines on the patching ports. Raise a service request to obtain the ports that require opening. Deploying the VPN instance You're now ready to deploy the instance. Expand Compute then select Instances . Click the Launch Instances button. In the Launch Instance dialog box, provide the following information: Details tab: Instance Name: Enter MMaaS-VPN-Endpoint or similar. Description: Leave blank.

    "title": "How to use my own polling (monitoring) tooling with Managed Monitoring as a Service",
    "keywords": "How to use your own polling (monitoring) tooling with Managed Monitoring as a Service Overview With Managed Monitoring as a Service, our Network Operations Centre (NOC) monitors your devices, receiving and reacting to any abnormal events, only escalating those events that genuinely require your attention. By default, we use our own monitoring systems to poll devices and perform remote checks. In certain situations, you may have your own monitoring tooling already established, but still want to forward your polling events to UKCloud's Managed Monitoring as a Service so that you can leverage UKCloud's 24x7x365 Network Operations Centre (NOC) capabilities. This article provides information and considerations regarding connecting your own polling (monitoring) solution to UKCloud's Managed Monitoring as a Service. Customer polling (monitoring) technology considerations Prerequisites While we're confident that modern monitoring tooling, such as Opsview, ManageEngine OpManager, Nagios and SolarWinds, should be able to pass their polling events to UKCloud's Managed Monitoring as a Service, we do need to perform an integration assessment (potentially chargeable) so that we can validate compatibility. Note We cannot guarantee integration with any/all monitoring technologies if an assessment has not been completed. Alert forwarding method If you want to provide your own polling service, then it must support one of the UKCloud's accepted methods of accepting alerts, which are: HTTPS GET/POST API integration with Moogsoft AIOps via HTTP/HTTPS reverse proxy SNMP traps Local command execution (for example, a script that can be executed that can generate an SNMP trap or make a POST or GET request to a URL) In addition to being able to forward alert information, the data must contain the hostname of the device and be able to provide a reference to a Playbook , which will be used by UKCloud to indicate the correct contact and escalation instructions for any live alert. Note We cannot guarantee that your polling technology will be compatible with the service until the forwarding method has been investigated, confirmed and tested by UKCloud. Non-standard monitoring checks Our standard checks are outlined in the Managed Monitoring as a Service Service Scope . If non-standard monitoring checks are required, these must be confirmed as cleared by UKCloud before go-ahead can be given. Connectivity between the customer and UKCloud Standard connectivity Connecting your own polling (monitoring) service to UKCloud's Managed Monitoring as a Service requires a method over which polling of devices can take place. As standard, this will be performed via a single site to site/IPsec VPN between a UKCloud VMware NSX Edge Gateway device and your network device. See Non-standard connectivity for more information beyond this standard implementation. Any customer VPN endpoint must be able to support Internet Key Exchange Version (IKEv1 or IKEv2) with the following configuration for the UKCloud VPN termination: Phase 1 Configuration item Value Encryption Algorithm for protection suite AES256 UpdHash Algorithm for protection suite SHA-256 Authentication Method PreShareKey Diffie-Hellman group DH-16 Lifetime (seconds) 28800 Exchange esp Phase 2 Configuration item Value Encryption Algorithm AES256 Hash Algorithm SHA-256 Lifetime (seconds) 3600 SA Lifetime Expiration (Traffic Volume in KBytes) NA Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) NA Protocol esp Non-standard connectivity If there's a requirement for using one of the following non-standard connectivity methods, it must be assessed by a UKCloud design authority before continuing: Failover via alternative/multiple VPN endpoints Leased line termination Monitoring via non-encrypted Internet (without a secure VPN) Further information may be required as to the specific network architecture. Playbooks UKCloud's Managed Monitoring as a Service uses the concept of playbooks to indicate the actions to be performed on receipt of an alert to UKCloud's NOC. A typical contact playbook provides UKCloud's NOC with your contact and escalation details, along with the following details on an alert by alert basis: Contact name/team name Contact number Contact email Whether telephone authentication is required, and the information to perform it At the very least, a single default playbook will be established for a given customer. Additionally, you can add more playbooks with specific contact instructions tied to individual alert types should a different contact or team be required for different alerts.

When filling out the spreadsheet, ensure that you follow the instructions provided. If you want to download the spreadsheet ahead of raising the request, click here . Note If you're not sure how to complete the spreadsheet or need help with any of the details, contact UKCloud Support. Specifying a patching window for a device A patching window determines when the patching will take place on a monitored device. You define a patching window for a device by adding it to a patching group. The patching groups are divided into two phases within a two week cycle that begins every other Tuesday in line with software vendor patching schedules. The first phase centres on the first weekend, and the second phase around the second weekend. An example where this may be useful is to select the first phase to patch staging devices and the second phase to patch production devices, thereby providing several days between the patching cycles. In My Calls, raise a ticket using the Managed IT Operations - Make changes to my managed devices template. Download the spreadsheet linked in the template. On the Credentials tab of the spreadsheet, add the set of credentials to be used for patching purposes if these are different from the administrative credentials used for the device. On the Device Information tab, enter the details of the device(s) for which you want to specify the patching window, making sure to select Yes in the Patching column. Tip You can find the details of your devices on previous spreadsheets if you have them. If you don't, and can't remember your device details, contact UKCloud Support, who will be able to provide you with the necessary information. On the Patching tab, in the row for the appropriate device, from the list in the DevicePatchingGroup column, select the patching group you want to add the device to. Tip Device names from the Device Information tab are auto-populated into the Patching tab. If the information doesn't auto-populate, in the Data ribbon, select Refresh All . Device names will then auto-populate in the PrimaryDeviceName column. If you specified separate patching credentials on the Credentials tab, in the PatchingCredentials column, select the name of the credentials to use when applying patches to the device. In the PatchingMethod column, select Automatically Select - Default . This ensures that UKCloud can select the most appropriate patching method for the device based on the supported operating system and service requirements. Note Do not select either of the other patching methods unless previously discussed and agreed with UKCloud. In the SnapshotBehaviour column, select the preferred behaviour for snapshots prior to performing the patching: hard - Attempt to snapshot the virtual machine prior to patching. If the snapshot is not successful, patching will not proceed. This is the default option. soft - Attempt to snapshot the virtual machine prior to patching. If the snapshot is not successful, patching will still proceed. disabled - Do not attempt to snapshot the virtual machine prior to patching. Use this option for virtual machines that are unable to have snapshots and environments where snapshots are not available. Note Currently, snapshot functionality is available only in UKCloud for VMware environments. When you've finished completing the spreadsheet, in your My Calls ticket either click Select files and browse to the completed spreadsheet or drag the spreadsheet into the template. Enter the date from which you want the changes to be effective. When you're done, click Review & Submit then Submit . As per our standard customer service targets, we aim to resolve your request within two working days.

    "title": "How to update contact information for Managed IT Operations",
    "keywords": "How to update contact information for Managed IT Operations Overview It's important to keep the contact information for your Managed IT Operations service up to date, so that, in the event of an alert that requires your attention, we can quickly get in touch with the relevant person within your organisation. All contact information is captured using playbooks. A playbook is a set of instructions that determine the actions to perform in response to a certain scenario. In the case of contact information, for example, all alerts could go to support@example.com , but for an Active Director server, they might go to adsupport@example.com . In addition, you can add an escalation contact for urgent alerts, whereby our Cloud Operations team can email or call another agreed contact in certain circumstances. Updating contact information Adding a new contact To add a new contact: In My Calls, raise a ticket using the Managed IT Operations - Playbooks template. From the Action list, select Add Playbook .

    "keywords": "Managed IT Operations prerequisites Overview Managed IT Operations helps to reduce the non-value add challenges of managing your compute assets, whilst increasing your overall level of trust and confidence in the true health of your entire multi-cloud estate. For more information, see the Managed IT Operations Service Definition . Before UKCloud can begin onboarding your virtual machines onto this service, your environment must meet the the prerequisites outlined in this article. Managed Monitoring as a Service With Managed Monitoring as a Service, UKCloud becomes your first line of support, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, receiving and reacting to any abnormal events or alerts across your IT estate. For more information, see the Managed Monitoring as a Service Service Scope . By default, UKCloud provides this service without the use of an agent by utilising SNMP traps. In situations where we need to collect non-SNMP events, we may opt to provide a dedicated Monitoring Agent, which can be deployed on to your virtual machines to provide a more advanced method of event collection. Customer environment configuration Ensure the following ports listed below are permitted on both your perimeter and operating system firewalls from the UKCloud management bubble subnet. UKCloud will provide you with the subnet. Linux & Windows Server (Agentless) Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) - UDP/161 Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Linux (Agent-based) Nagios Remote Plugin Executor (NRPE) - TCP/5666 Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Windows Server (Agent-based) Nagios Remote Plugin Executor (NRPE) - TCP/5666 Windows Remote Management (WinRM) - TCP/5985 & TCP/5986 Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Note Add any custom ports you'd like monitored. For example, to monitor the state of a web server on port TCP/443, port TCP/443 must be allowed through from the UKCloud management bubble subnet. Operating system services SNMP is required for agentless monitoring. Note The SNMP service must be configured to start on boot. Linux On Linux, you can install SNMP from the operating system's public repository. Windows Server On Windows Server, you can install SNMP through the Roles and Features wizard. VPN configuration Managed Monitoring as a Service relies on an IPsec VPN being configured on your environment's edge appliance. For VMware, this will be an edge gateway, whereas in OpenStack this will be a customer deployed (or assisted by UKCloud) VPN server. By default, UKCloud recommends a pfSense appliance. UKCloud will provide you with the VPN standards and configuration, including the pre-shared key, peer endpoint and peer subnet to configure the VPN. Anti-Virus as a Service Anti-Virus as a Service provides you with the confidence that your environments are protected from the dangers of viruses and malware, all without the usual headaches associated with the deployment, management, and operation of an antivirus solution. For more information see the Anti-Virus as a Service Service Scope . UKCloud will provide you with the installation package(s) and commands to install and configure the antivirus agent on your virtual machines. Patching as a Service Patching as a Service provides routine OS patch management for compute instances. It helps you accelerate business value by removing the burden of basic OS hygiene, letting you focus your attention above the operating system. For more information, see the Patching as a Service Service Scope . Operating systems UKCloud only supports in-life, vendor-backed operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Canonical Ubuntu. Customer-built operating systems (for example Gentoo Linux custom build) are unsupported by this service. Virtual software appliances are also unsupported by this service. Customer environment configuration If you've opted for taking snapshots of your virtual machines prior to patching, then the environment must be hosted in VMware and the name of the virtual machine(s) in Cloud Director must match the hostname in the OS. Linux To provide secure communication between UKCloud's centralised patch management platform and your virtual machine, we use key-based SSH sessions, reducing the need to share credentials. As such, you'll need to fulfil the following prerequisites on each virtual machine subscribing to this service: An allow rule for port TCP/22 (SSH) on your virtual machine's firewall (for example, iptables). A local user account with passwordless sudo access. You'll need to share details of this account with UKCloud when onboarding to this service. The /etc/ssh/sshd_config configuration file must be configured to allow SSH access for the patching user you created in the step above. UKCloud will provide you with a public SSH key during the onboarding process. You'll need to append this key to the authorized_keys file, located at ~/.ssh/authorized_keys within the home directory of the user you created in the step above. As part of the onboarding process, UKCloud can perform this action as long as the above requirements are already met. Windows Server For UKCloud to correctly scan for and apply operating system patches, you must agree to enable and configure the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol by ensuring ports TCP/445 and TCP/139 are open on all virtual machines and associated operating systems opted-in to this service. Furthermore, there must be a bi-directional rule allowing port TCP/3121 on your edge appliance and operating system firewall. For further details, please see the vendor's documentation found here . Furthermore, you must create a patching user that is an administrator on the virtual machine and has access to the Control Panel. Finally, you must enable the Remote Registry service on all virtual machines and enable Filer and Print Sharing for all networks. Domain joined If the Windows virtual machines are domain joined, the user must be using domain administrator credentials. Standalone If the Windows virtual machines are standalone, the device must have User Account Control (UAC) disabled.

    "keywords": "How to migrate your workloads to the UKCloud platform Overview UKCloud makes it easy for you to seamlessly migrate your existing workloads from a local VMware or Hyper-V powered data centre to our cloud platform. Our Workload Migration service is powered by Zerto, a leading provider of disaster recovery software for the cloud. Intended audience This article is intended for users who want to migrate their workloads onto the UKCloud platform. Before you begin When you request Workload Migration, UKCloud provides you with: The IP address (from the IP range you provided to UKCloud) of the Zerto Cloud Connector (ZCC) deployed in your target VDC; you'll need this to complete the setup of the site-to-site VPN between your local environment and your UKCloud target VDC A link to the appropriate version of the Zerto Virtual Manager (ZVM) for you to deploy in your local environment A ZORG ID to identify your Zerto environment within the UKCloud platform Access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal (ZSSP) in the appropriate UKCloud zone You should consider the following: VMs must be powered on to be synchronised The operating system used by the source VMs must also be supported in the target site System requirements To use our Workload Migration service, you must have a valid, centrally managed vSphere or HyperV estate. A single hypervisor is not sufficient. The following table lists the requirements for Workload Migration, based on the currently deployed version of Zerto Virtual Replication (8.5U2) on the UKCloud platform: Product Supported Version Management Plane VMware vCenter vCenter Server 6.0, 6.5, 6.5 U1, 6.5 U2, 6.5 U3, 6.7, 6.7 U1, 6.7 U2, 6.7 U3, 7.0, 7.0 U1 Microsoft SCVMM 2016 and Server Core: RTM Rollup 3-5, 6, 7, 8, 2019 and Server Core: RTM Rollup 1 Hosts VMware ESXi 6.0, 6.5, 6.5 U1, 6.5 U2, 6.5 U3, 6.7, 6.7 U1, 6.7 U2, 6.7 U3, 7.0, 7.0 U1 Microsoft Hyper-V Windows 2016 Server, Microsoft Hyper-V Server 2019 Virtual Machines Hardware Version VMware 7-9, 10-11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18 Hyper-V Generation 1 & 2 Migration to the Cloud Connectivity Full duplex internet connection 5Mb/s minimum IPsec VPN NA For a complete list of hypervisor features supported when using Workload Migration, see the Interoperability Matrix for All Zerto Software Versions . Migrating workloads to UKCloud Create a target VDC Set up your local environment Configure networking on the target site Create a virtual protection group Migrate your workloads Create a target VDC To migrate your workloads to the UKCloud platform, you must have a VDC in the intended target site. If you already have a compute service in the UKCloud site, you can use an existing VDC or you can create a new one using: The UKCloud Portal (see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware ) The UKCloud Portal API (see the How to use the UKCloud Portal API ) If you don't already have a compute service in the UKCloud site or you'd prefer UKCloud to create the VDC for you, you can request this as part of your Workload Migration Service Request. Set up your local environment Before you can start migrating your workloads to UKCloud, you need to prepare your local environment by: Installing the appropriate version of Zerto Virtual Manager (ZVM) in your local environment Creating a secure site-to-site VPN between your local environment and the UKCloud platform For more information, see How to install and configure Zerto in your local environment . Configure networking on the target site You must configure any internally and externally routed networks in your UKCloud target VDC to duplicate those in your local environment. You must also configure the edge gateway with the same firewall, NAT and other rules. You'll create the mapping between these networks when you create your VPG. When you migrate your workloads, external access to the UKCloud VDC will be via a different IP address. You'll need to account for any required DNS changes and external connectivity configuration (such as VPNs), to ensure continued external access. Utilising UKCloud's VMware cloud, you can configure this in advance. Alternatively, you can use load balancing technologies to manage a seamless switch between environments. Create a virtual protection group A virtual protection group (VPG) is a collection of VMs that are grouped together for migration. When you create a VPG, a replica of each VM disk is created on the target UKCloud site. These replica virtual disks are then populated with the data in the source VMs by synchronising the source VMs with the target site replicas. For more information, see How to create a virtual protection group . Migrate your workloads Within Zerto, you have two options for migrating your workloads: Move the VPG to the target site. This method performs an end-to-end migration, including removing the VMs from the source site after they have been moved. For more information, see the steps below. Perform a live failover. This method provides more flexibility for you to control what happens on the source site after you move the VMs to the target site. For more information, see How to perform a failover . To move a VPG: Login to the ZSSP . Use the ZSSP login link for the zone in which your target VDC is located. At the bottom of the page, select Move , then VPG . In the Move wizard, on the Select VPGs page, select one or more VPGs that you want to move then click Next . Note When you move a VPG, you cannot select which checkpoint to use. Zerto uses the most recent checkpoint. On the Execute Parameters page, the commit policy gives you the opportunity to check the integrity of the migrated VMs before committing the move. To change the commit policy, click the Commit Policy field and select: Auto-Commit if you want to automatically commit the move after a specified amount of time if there is no user interaction. Set the amount of time in the After field, up to a maximum of 1440 minutes (24 hours). If you want the move to be immediately committed, enter 0. Auto-Rollback if you want to automatically roll back the move after a specified amount of time if there is no user interaction. Set the amount of time in the After field, up to a maximum of 1440 minutes (24 hours). If you want the move to be immediately rolled back, enter 0. None if you do not want to apply a commit policy. You must manually commit or roll back the move. The source VMs must be powered off before they can be migrated. If the VMs cannot be gracefully shut down, you can force a shutdown. To force shutdown, select the Force Shutdown check box. If you do not select this option and the VMs cannot be gracefully shut down, the move process fails. Reverse protection ensures that when the source VMs are migrated to the target site, the source site becomes the new target site. Reverse protection is enabled by default, but you can disable it by clicking the Reverse Protection field and deselecting the Reverse check box. Click Next . On the Move page, review the diagram to see the number of VPGs and VMs included in the move and where they will be moved to, then click Start Move . The move process creates the VMs in the target site. Note If a VM already exists on the target site with the same name as one of the source VMs, a number is added to the end of the target VM name to ensure that it's unique. If you set a commit policy with a time greater than zero, you can check the integrity of the migrated VMs before committing (or rolling back) the migration. When you've finished testing, you can either wait for the time to elapse before the auto commit or auto rollback, or on the VPGs tab, click the VPG Name and then click the Commit or Rollback icon as required. After the migrated VMs are up and running and committed in the target site, the powered off VMs in the source site are removed from the source site and data from the journal is promoted to the migrated VMs. If you enabled reverse protection, the migrated VMs are protected on the source site. Next steps To see what you can do with your application now that it's on the UKCloud platform, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware . If you used failover to migrate your workloads, when you've determined that the migration has been successful, you should remove the original VMs from the source site to remove any workloads that are no longer required.

    "title": "Troubleshooting Migration to the Cloud",
    "keywords": "Troubleshooting Migration to the Cloud (powered by Zerto) Overview This guide describes some of the issues you may encounter when using UKCloud's Workload Migration to the Cloud service: Starting a test failover takes a long time RPO alerts and bitmap syncing Recovery storage errors and journal size alerts during test failovers Test failover VMs do not perform as expected Live failover does not perform the same as test failover Important During the failover process, any change in the configuration or state of the live or failed‑over VMs (for example, power on or power off) will cause failure of the failover and may corrupt the VPG. This could make a full resync necessary. Starting a test failover takes a long time Cause When you initiate a test failover, Zerto creates VMs in vCloud (referred to as testing recovery VMs) and then performs further tasks to provide the correct data for those VMs to boot from. VM creation and other operations in vCloud unavoidably take some time, therefore when performing a simultaneous failover of many VMs, it can be a while before the VMs are powered on and ready for use. Zerto automatically powers on the testing recovery VMs when it has completed the operations necessary to make the correct data available to the VMs. Powering on a VM prematurely will cause it to be corrupted and will impact live replication. Additionally, manually powering-off a testing recovery VM will cause live replication to stop; testing recovery VMs must remain powered on for the duration of the test failover. Solution If you're failing over many VMs simultaneously, you should anticipate that it will take some time before the VMs are powered on and ready for use. Important Do not manually power on or power off recovery VMs during a failover. Doing so will corrupt the VPG. RPO alerts and bitmap syncing Cause Some application and database servers have a high change rate. Limited VPN bandwidth from the on-premises sites means that often changes to the live VMs occur faster than the rate of replication. Solution For workload migration, the increased recovery point objecting (RPO) is not a concern. We recommend that, unless there are specific reasons otherwise, you set the priority of your Workload Migration to the Cloud VPGs to Medium to ensure that all VPGs replicate fairly compared to each other. Recovery storage errors and journal size alerts during test failovers Cause Due to the way that testing recovery VMs are instantiated, Zerto is unable to flush the oldest journal entries into the base recovery disks while a test failover is in progress. This means that the journal size continuously grows while the test failover is in progress, at a rate dependant on the change rate of the live VM. This will cause alerts when the journal reaches 75% of its maximum size. When the journal reaches 100% of its maximum size, replication of the live VM stops since there is nowhere to place new checkpoints. At this point, the VPG will show a state of Recovery Storage Error and will be required to perform a lengthy sync when the test failover is stopped. Solution For workload migration, the gaps in replication that result from this problem may be acceptable, so it is likely that you can ignore these alerts during test failovers. Additionally, you will see Recovery Storage Error and other transient errors in the Zerto console while a test failover is in the process of starting; you can ignore these in all cases. Test failover VMs do not perform as expected Cause Testing recovery VMs (and live failed-over VMs before they are committed) do not run from normal virtual disks. To remove the need to fully clone all data, when Zerto does a test failover (or a live failover before committing), it creates a simulated view onto the VM's disks at the checkpoint time you select. All reads from the disks are intercepted by Zerto's ESXi kernel driver and then processed with reference to the journal to ensure that the correct data for that checkpoint's point-in-time is returned. Additionally, any writes made to the testing recovery VM are diverted to a temporary file. While the test failover is in progress, Zerto is unable to flush the oldest journal checkpoints into the base VMDK disks in order to preserve the integrity of the replicated base disks and journals. Solution Zerto test failovers are intended to give confidence that the data on the VM disks is being correctly replicated. We recommend that you should not use test failover VMs for detailed application testing for the following reasons: If the test failover goes on too long, new changes from the live VM will cause the journal to fill, halting replication of the live VM A large volume of writes to the testing recovery VMs will cause those VMs to fail Storage performance of the testing recovery VMs is very poor, potentially up to 50% slower than native performance These issues are also applicable to live failovers that have not yet been committed. When the commit operation is completed, the resulting VMs are running from normal VMDK files and are no longer subject to these problems. When performing a live failover, we recommend that: You stop the applications on the on-premises site VMs before triggering the failover. This ensures that the application state is consistent at the point of failover and will avoid Recovery Storage Errors due to the journal filling while the VPG is in a live Failover Before Commit state. Do not perform any application testing on the failed-over VMs that might cause too much new data to be written to the VM's disks before commit. Plan to complete the commit operation during the outage window for the migration. Additionally, you should consider the following during a live failover: We do not recommend the use of auto commit; this option causes the commit to occur automatically after the failover is initiated. Do not enable reverse replication unless you fully understand all the potential implications of doing so. Enabling reverse replication causes the VMDK disks of the source VMs to be altered to seed the reverse replication. The VPGs in Zerto enter a Needs Configuration state after the failover is committed. We recommend that you delete the VPGs from Zerto at this stage to ensure reverse replication cannot be configured accidently. If reverse replication isn't enabled, the source VMs will remain untouched (even post-commit) to serve as a worst-case recovery option if the migration doesn't go to plan. It's likely that the live failover (excluding the commit operation) will take a similar length of time as a test failover. The commit operation converts the failed-over VMs into normal vCloud VMs not subject to the limitations inherent to test failover (or live failover before commit) VMs. The commit operation is performed while the VMs (on the UKCloud side) remain running and will take several hours (dependant on the size and change-rate of the live VM). Live failover does not perform the same as test failover Cause In the current version of Zerto, live failovers typically take longer to start that test failovers. Also, features such as guest customization behave differently during a live failover. Solution Before a migration, we recommend that you trigger a live failover as a practice ahead of time so that you can accurately predict timescales and behaviour. When you can confirm that the failed-over VPGs are in a Failover Before Commit state, you should roll back this failover (rather than commit it). If Shutdown [live] VMs and Auto Commit are not selected (and you do not manually commit the failover), the practice failover should not affect live VMs. In all cases, you should take care to understand any networking implications of performing a practice live failover ahead of time.

    "keywords": "UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift FAQs What is UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift? UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift is UKCloud's OpenShift powered Kubernetes Platform as a Service (PaaS). The service provides a secure, private deployment of the Red Hat™ OpenShift™ Container Platform. The service is delivered as a managed platform, enabling developers to build automation pipelines and leverage the benefits of containerised solutions, helping to deliver modern, cloud-native applications and accelerate digital transformation. UKCloud deploys, monitors and updates the platform, freeing up your DevOps resources to focus on adding value further up the stack through the rapid delivery of quality controlled code, all without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure or platform services. For an overview what the service offers, see the UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift Service Definition . For specific details about the implementation and boundaries of the service, see the UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift Service Scope . Why deliver UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift as a cloud service? Although UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift is a simple, benefits-rich service to consume, it's a complex platform of inter-dependent servers and services, whose deployment, configuration and maintenance requires time and expertise. By offering this service, we take on all that complexity so that customers can immediately realise the value of UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift by simply consuming it. Does my data leave the UK? As the service is delivered from UK data centres by a UK company, your data doesn't leave the UK when at rest. Is the service Pan Government Accredited? UKCloud's existing PGA continues to apply to the infrastructure underpinning our services. But since the move to the Government Security Classification Policy (GSCP), we can no longer seek PGA for newer services, such as UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift. We are now required to self-assert our services, with customers taking responsibility for assessing and selecting the most appropriate cloud services to meet their individual security requirements. We provide confidence that our OpenShift service still meets the highest level of information assurance, which is why we continue to have our platform independently tested and validated, and have the findings made available to customers and partners. This enables SIROs to make an informed decision about any service they choose to consume. What languages and frameworks are compatible with UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift? The service supports many popular development frameworks and languages such as: Java Spring Ruby Sinatra Node.js Python PHP GoLang For the full list, see https://access.redhat.com/articles/2176281?hsLang=en-us and https://access.redhat.com/articles/4763741 . Does UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift support any data services? Our OpenShift service provides popular open source data service packages deployable within the platform, all supported by the global open source community, including: MySQL, an open source relational database Postgres, a relational database based on PostgreSQL MongoDB, a scalable, open, document-based database RabbitMQ, for reliable, scalable and portable messaging for applications Note that these services are offered 'as is' with no management, support or availability commitment from UKCloud. We strongly suggest customers ensure they maintain a original copy or backup copy of any persistent or dynamic data hosted on this service (such as MySQL DB) by using, for example, a data service provided by a managed service provider on our UKCloud for VMware platform. How scalable is UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift? As a true cloud platform, UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift provides full elasticity and scalability. However, in order to protect the integrity of the platform and manage customer spend, soft limits on the number and size of application instances will be in place. These limits may be extended upon request. Which ports are open to the platform from the internet by default? By default, ports 80 and 443 are open for customer application traffic. Further ports can be opened on request either at time of deployment or post-deployment by raising a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. How do I add users? To add new users, you will need to raise a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. What monitoring of the services is provided by default in a trial? By default, no specific monitoring service is integrated. However, we recommend external monitoring services such as Datadog or Coscale for production-grade OpenShift hosted applications. Alternatively, you can implement your own simple monitoring solution as described in How to monitor your OpenShift cluster . What monitoring of the services is provided on a billable service? By default, no specific monitoring service is integrated. It is our expectation that customers may want to use a third party or their own monitoring service to ensure cluster availability. There is a metrics service deployed into the cluster that provides utilisation stats of the cluster, and a wide range of metrics about both the cluster itself and the containers running within it can be extracted via the API to this service. Can I integrate external monitoring SaaS providers or my own monitoring agents to the service? We will happily work with customers during a trial period to integrate an external monitoring service that enables customer monitoring of the cluster and applications where infrastructure level configuration is required. How do I add extra capacity to my cluster? To add extra capacity to you cluster, you will need to raise a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. We hope to provide portal integration to enable customers to be in control of this in the future. How many persistent volumes can I claim/attach to each worker node? In line with current restrictions on the OpenStack service underpinning OpenShift, you can claim/attach 25 additional persistent volume claims (PVCs) to each worker node. Can I have integrated container logging deployed with the platform? Yes, this can be requested at time of deployment, or added post-deployment. The services can be run on either the infrastructure nodes or the worker nodes in the cluster. By default, we would place them on the infrastructure nodes, but you may wish to change this placement to be more suitable for the specific cluster performance you desire. How much control do I have over the policies and configuration of the platform once it has been deployed? Customers have full administrative rights over the cluster configuration via the UI and API. Due to the varied nature of configurations that customers may want, such as the ability to merge projects and add service accounts for applications, we provide customers with the ability to self-serve on cluster administration from the beginning. Only infrastructure level tasks are controlled by UKCloud, such as adding users, scaling environments and patching. Can I run a privileged container? Yes, it is possible to run a privileged container. However, this is not recommended as it goes against security best practices. What is the underlying architecture of the starter deployment?

UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift provides a full Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform that has been deployed by UKCloud and is ready to consume without delay. You can then create one or more OpenShift projects in which you can run multiple pods, with each pod containing a group of related containers. OpenShift documentation: OpenShift Container Platform architecture and Understanding container security Before you begin To complete the steps in this guide, you must have access to an OpenShift environment, along with an internet-enabled device capable of running an HTML5 capable browser. As part of your onboarding, UKCloud will provide you with a URL and credentials to access your OpenShift environment. In addition, we recommend the installation of the OpenShift CLI on your device. OpenShift documentation: Getting started with the CLI Initial environment OpenShift clusters can be deployed with flexible sizing, including different options for worker node sizes. We recommend a mininum of two worker nodes to provide resiliency. OpenShift v4 clusters provide the option of hourly pricing and self-service scaling. For more information about sizing options for OpenShift, see Pricing information for UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift . If you'd like to expand an existing cluster, you can request this by raising a Service Request through the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. Using the web console The OpenShift Container Platform web console is a user interface accessible from a web browser. Developers can use the web console to visualize, browse, and manage the contents of projects. If your OpenShift cluster uses OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 3.10 or later, you can log in to the console, via our single sign on service, using your UKCloud Portal credentials. Additionally, if you've set up two-factor authentication (2FA) in the Portal, when logging in using your Portal credentials, you'll be prompted for a 2FA code. Note To log in to the OpenShift web console using your Portal credentials, your Portal account must have been granted access to the cluster. If your OpenShift cluster uses an earlier version of OCP, you will need to use your separate OpenShift credentials to log in to the console. OpenShift documentation: About the Developer perspective in the web console Using the command-line interface With the OpenShift Container Platform command line interface (CLI), you can create applications and manage OpenShift Container Platform projects from a terminal. If your OpenShift cluster uses OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 3.10 or later, when you enter the login command, you'll be given a URL to use to log in using your Portal credentials. Go to this URL and you'll be prompted for your Portal credentials and, if you've set up 2FA, your 2FA code. This will take you to a page with your API token, the command to run to log in to the CLI and curl request to use to log in to the CLI. Alternatively, you can obtain the CLI login command (including login token) from the OpenShift console by clicking your user name and selecting Copy Login Command . Note The token in the log in command supplied through the URL or OpenShift console is valid only for a limited time. If you require a more longer lasting token, you can use a service account token. For more information see the OpenShift Understanding and creating service accounts documentation. OpenShift documentation: Getting started with the CLI , Developer CLI commands , and Administrator CLI commands Using the API The OpenShift Container Platform distribution of Kubernetes includes the Kubernetes v1 REST API and the OpenShift v1 REST API. These are RESTful APIs accessible via HTTPS on the OpenShift Container Platform control plane servers. These REST APIs can be used to manage end-user applications, the cluster, and the users of the cluster. OpenShift documentation: API index Developing and deploying applications OpenShift Container Platform is designed for building and deploying applications. You can begin your application's development from scratch using OpenShift Container Platform directly or develop locally then use OpenShift Container Platform to deploy your fully developed application. OpenShift documentation: Understanding OpenShift Container Platform development Creating and using images Containers in OpenShift Container Platform are based on Docker-formatted container images. An image is a binary that includes all the requirements for running a single container, as well as metadata describing its needs and capabilities. Containers only have access to resources defined in the image unless you give the container additional access when creating it. OpenShift documentation: Creating images Next steps In this Getting Started Guide, you've learned the basics about UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift.

    "title": "How to permit outbound access to internet hosts in deployments with government community network connectivity",
    "keywords": "How to permit outbound access to internet hosts in deployments with government community network connectivity Overview This article outlines the necessary steps to add domain names to an allow-list within the Squid proxy. Squid is an enabled service within v3.11 OpenShift clusters deployed with connectivity to government community networks (such as: HSCN, PSN, Janet). Domains on the allow-list can be accessed on the internet via the proxy, enabling you to request external resources/data on nodes that previously only had connectivity to government community networks. Added domains should be scrutinised as the relevant authority of the community network may require you to submit documentation regarding these for you to receive accreditation. Prerequisites To complete the steps in this guide, you must have access to a cluster that is running OpenShift Container Platform v3.11 (or newer) with connectivity to a government community network. Squid proxy is not currently enabled within environments that do not have access to a government community network. You must also have access to either: the OpenShift Web console oc , the OpenShift command-line client (CLI). For more information, see OpenShift's Get Started with the CLI Destination domain allow-list Squid proxy is installed as a service on the control plane load balancers. Within the Squid configuration, we have specified an ACL (Access Control List) as being a list of destination domains (present in a file on the file system), which we will refer to as the allow-list for the remainder of this article. Outbound traffic from the cluster's internal network will pass through the proxy with the destination domain being compared against the allow-list for each connection attempt; if the domain exists then outbound internet traffic is permitted, otherwise it is denied with a HTTP 403 error. By default, the following domains are added to the allow-list (and cannot be removed) to facilitate installation, testing and ongoing operation of the cluster: registry.access.redhat.com registry.redhat.io <UKCloud Object Storage Endpoint - cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com OR cas.frn00006.ukcloud.com> <UKCloud SSO Endpoint - idp.ukcloud.com> Warning Adding any subdomains of domains that are already within the proxy allow-list will lead to squid being unable to reconfigure and any domains added after this point will not be accessible. Please keep the above domains in mind when adding to the allow-list as these will not be shown in the ConfigMap. To give an example, you should avoid adding .ukcloud.com or .redhat.com to your proxy allow-list as both registry.access.redhat.com and idp.ukcloud.com are already on the allow-list. A scheduled job (which runs at 0 minutes past every hour) on the OpenShift cluster Bastion host reads a Config Map named proxy-whitelist within the whitelist project. If there are any modifications to this Config Map, the job overwrites the previous custom entries within the allow-list and triggers a reconfigure task on the Squid proxy to enable the updated domains to be accessed. Assigning non cluster-admin users rights to edit the allow-list By default, only users who have been assigned the cluster-admin role will be able to view/edit the proxy-whitelist ConfigMap object within the whitelist project. It is possible to grant non cluster-admin users rights to edit this object but this should be given careful consideration. The ability to access hosts on the internet, from nodes that previously only had access to government community networks, exposes the cluster to additional risk (should a domain be added to the allow-list that hosts malicious content for example). For this reason, only trusted users should be permitted to determine these domains to reduce the risk of a malicious domain being unwittingly added. To allow non cluster-admin users to edit this object, use the following Role Based Access Control (RBAC) commands: Tip To add multiple users to these roles, separate each username within the username variable with a space. export username=<replace-with-username> # Create roles oc create role view-project --verb=get,list,watch --resource=namespaces --verb get --resource=projects -n whitelist oc create role get-configmap --verb=get,list --resource=configmaps -n whitelist oc create role edit-proxy-whitelist --verb=patch,update --resource=configmaps --resource-name=proxy-whitelist -n whitelist # Bind roles to desired user oc policy add-role-to-user view-project $username -n whitelist --role-namespace='whitelist' oc policy add-role-to-user get-configmap $username -n whitelist --role-namespace='whitelist' oc policy add-role-to-user edit-proxy-whitelist $username -n whitelist --role-namespace='whitelist' Modifying the allow-list There are two tools you can use to modify the proxy-whitelist Config Map. As previously stated you will need to have the necessary rights to edit this object within the whitelist project. Web console To view the proxy-whitelist Config Map within the whitelist project, navigate to the following URL (ensuring you replace <your-deployment-name>): https://ocp.<your-deployment-name>.cna.ukcloud.com:8443/console/project/whitelist/browse/config-maps/proxy-whitelist Tip To add all subdomains to the allow-list, precede the domain with a . for example .domain.com Click Actions then Edit to modify the values within the proxy-whitelist.txt key. Each domain should be on its own line: Click Save when finished. oc client Note To authenticate using the oc client you will need an API token. Retrieve this by logging in to the Web Console and clicking your name in the top right then choosing Copy Login Command . This can then be pasted from your buffer into a terminal where you have the oc client installed. Change to the whitelist project: $ oc project whitelist Edit the proxy-whitelist Config Map: $ oc edit cm proxy-whitelist This will display the object definition in yaml format in your default text editor: # Please edit the object below. Lines beginning with a '#' will be ignored, # and an empty file will abort the edit. If an error occurs while saving this file will be # reopened with the relevant failures. # apiVersion: v1 data: proxy-whitelist.txt: \"\" kind: ConfigMap metadata: creationTimestamp: 2019-01-18T01:18:44Z name: proxy-whitelist namespace: whitelist resourceVersion: \"5385199\" selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/whitelist/configmaps/proxy-whitelist uid: ff7df4a9-1abe-11e9-965a-fa163ecc60e0 Within the object definition data attribute is the proxy-whitelist.txt key.

    "keywords": "How to backup, restore and migrate OpenShift resources Overview Velero is an open-source tool set that provides the ability to backup and restore Kubernetes resources. The GitHub repository is available at: https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero . This guide outlines how to: Install Velero in your cluster (using our Elastic Cloud Storage product as the backup location) Backup and restore namespaces to the same cluster Restore a namespace to a new cluster Velero offers a tool called restic that enables backup of persistent volume data regardless of provider, however this guide doesn't cover restic as the tool is considered beta-quality. If you'd like to test it you can find more on restic here: https://velero.io/docs/v1.5/restic/ . Installing Velero Download Velero from https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/releases . You can deploy Velero onto OpenShift with the velero install command. To deploy Velero, you'll need compatible object storage: https://velero.io/docs/v1.1.0/support-matrix/ . In this article we use UKCloud's Cloud Storage product. After logging in to the cluster via the CLI, run the following command to configure a yaml file that you can then edit and use to create the Velero deployment in the cluster: velero install --bucket velero-test --provider aws --plugins velero/velero-plugin-for-aws:v1.1.0 --secret-file ./secret-file.txt --dry-run -o yaml > deploy-velero.yml secret-file.txt contains the access and secret key for the ECS bucket in the following format: [default] aws_access_key_id=<key> aws_secret_access_key=<key> As you're not using AWS at this point, edit the deploy-velero.yaml file, find the BackupStorageLocation and add s3Url and region to the config key mapping. For example: - apiVersion: velero.io/v1 kind: BackupStorageLocation metadata: creationTimestamp: null labels: component: velero name: default namespace: velero spec: config: {\"s3Url\": \"https://cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com\",\"region\": \"us-east-1\"} objectStorage: bucket: velero-test provider: aws Run: oc create -f deploy-velero.yml This deploys a Velero project and the required resources to backup and restore resources in your cluster (excluding persistent volume data). Backing up and restoring resources For the purposes of the example in this article, we tested restoring a deleted namespace, called backup-test , that contains a ruby example build that uses S2I. This application uses a route and no persistent storage. To create a backup of the namespace: Run: velero backup create test1 --include-namespaces backup-test --wait Once you've run this command you can check the backup exists and get some information on it with the following commands: velero get backups velero describe backup test1 After confirming that the backup exists and was completed successfully you're ready to restore the namespace. To restore the namespace, run the following command: velero create restore restore1 --from-backup test1 This recreates the namespace and all resources within it. If you watch the namespace however, you'll see that not everything is recreated correctly. In our example we have a ruby-example build that pulls a GitHub repository and builds an image and deployment from this. The first thing we notice is that a new build is triggered, and it goes directly into pending state. The error message in events is: 'MountVolume.SetUp failed for volume \"builder-dockercfg-9589h-push\" : secrets \"builder-dockercfg-9589h\" not found' . The problem appears to be that the build is referencing the secret that the builder service account had in the original namespace. However, when the namespace is restored, the builder service account generates a new docker secret. To fix this you'll need to cancel the build, delete the service account to allow it to be recreated and run the build again. In our example, the commands to achieve this are: oc cancel-build ruby-ex-1 oc delete build ruby-ex-1 oc delete sa builder oc start-build ruby-ex There may be extra steps needed to restore your namespaces depending on the resources within them. We recommend that you test the restores and document the process required to get it back in a working state. Migrating resources Velero also offers the ability to link multiple clusters to the same object storage and migrate resources/namespaces across. All that you need to do is deploy Velero into your second cluster and set the same bucket as its BackupStorageLocation . Backups should then be synched and be restorable into the new cluster. For example, to migrate the backup-test namespace from our previous example into a new cluster in a different region: Log into the new cluster via the CLI on your local machine: oc login $cluster_url --token=$api_token Follow the installation steps to create your deploy file and run: oc create -f deploy-velero.yml Run the following to ensure that the namespaces are connected to the same backup location (you may need to allow a minute or so for backups to sync to your new cluster): velero get backups You should see any backups taken in your first cluster that are in the Object Storage bucket. If you can see them then you will be able to restore them into your new cluster. In our example we have the test1 backup from earlier. To restore this backup to the new cluster: velero create restore migration1 --from-backup test1 As previously, we'll have to sort out the issue with the builder account's secret. Once this is resolved, we'll have the application running in our new cluster. In our example, we have a route unique to the domain of the cluster, so we need to delete the route and expose the service in the new cluster to create a route pointing to the right DNS record. For any production applications with a route, rather than changing the route itself, you would want to reconfigure your DNS to point to the new cluster IP.

The way around this is to use a deploy key . This guide assumes you have access to the command-line oc client, and have logged in to your OpenShift cluster with oc login . Building an OpenShift application from a private GitHub repository Create an ssh key-pair Note Don't use your regular one, and make sure you don't overwrite your regular one either. ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -c \"jbloggs@example.com\" -f my_GitHub_deploy_key This will generate both the private and public key files.

    "keywords": "How to disable weak cipher suites and enable HSTS Overview This article outlines steps to increase the security of externally exposed routes from your OpenShift cluster, through the use of more secure cipher suites and HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS). Intended audience OpenShift developers who have created and deployed services into OpenShift and created and exposed secure routes for those services. Disable weak cipher suites Cipher suites perform an important role in determining the security of a TLS connection. Over time, vulnerabilities have been identified in the algorithms used by cipher suites, which has resulted in published methods of decrypting and manipulating encrypted traffic. It's therefore generally recommended to use as modern a cipher suite as possible. UKCloud for OpenShift v3.x Data plane To provide extended client compatibility, the OpenShift router supports cipher suites from TLS 1.0 - TLS 1.2 by default. Some of these cipher suites (especially older ones) are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. If exposed secure routes are only being accessed from modern clients (that support TLS 1.2 and above), you can disable the weak cipher suites by adding the following environment variable to any router DeploymentConfig : oc set env dc/router ROUTER_CIPHERS=modern -n default This triggers a rollout of the DeploymentConfig . Going forward, the new router pods will only accept cipher suites from TLS 1.2. Control plane By default, the OpenShift control plane (web console) only supports TLS 1.2 ciphers, although these do not provide forward secrecy. We can restrict the ciphers to only those that provide forward secrecy. To do this, raise a Service Request with the UKCloud OpenShift Support team via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. UKCloud for OpenShift v4.x Data plane There are no weak ciphers supported by the OpenShift IngressController since by default it supports TLS 1.2 cipher suites with forward secrecy. It is possible to further restrict the ciphers by modifying the default IngressController object, specifically the value of IngressController.spec.tlsSecurityProfile : oc edit ingresscontroller default -n openshift-ingress-operator As an example, the below would omit cipher suites using the DHE key exchange: apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1 kind: IngressController metadata: name: example namespace: openshift-ingress-operator spec: tlsSecurityProfile: type: Custom custom: ciphers: - TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 - TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 - TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 - ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 - ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 - ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 - ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 - ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305 - ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305 minTLSVersion: VersionTLS12 Control plane There are no weak ciphers supported by the OpenShift control plane (API) since by default it supports TLS 1.2 and 1.3 cipher suites with forward secrecy. Enable HSTS HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) prevents MITM attacks, such as protocol downgrading by setting a header within HTTPS responses. This header ( Strict-Transport-Security ) is cached by a browser and ensures that future requests to the same host always use HTTPS rather than HTTP. Note It is currently not possible to enable HSTS for the the OpenShift v3.x web console or OpenShift v4.x API server. Warning You should enable HSTS only on routes that currently have a valid certificate. If the certificate becomes invalid, the route will be inaccessible, due to how browsers' HSTS mechanisms works. You should exercise particular caution if you're using a non-standard hostname (that is, not ending in <your-cluster-hostname>.ukcloud.com ) for a route. In this case you should ensure a valid certificate is contained within the route spec (for edge and re-encrypt routes) or within the container (if using the pass-through TLS encryption method). Enable HSTS on secure routes by using the following command: oc annotate route <routename> haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header=max-age=31536000 By default in UKCloud for OpenShift v4.x clusters, the following apps routes provisioned during deployment have HSTS enabled: OpenShift Console Kibana AlertManager Grafana Prometheus Thanos Further reading https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security UKCloud for OpenShift v3.x Specific https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install_config/router/default_haproxy_router.html#bind-ciphers https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/admin_guide/managing_networking.html#admin-guide-enabling-hsts UKCloud for OpenShift v4.x Specific https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/networking/routes/route-configuration.html#nw-enabling-hsts_route-configuration Feedback If you find a problem with this article, click Improve this Doc to make the change yourself or raise an issue in GitHub.

In earlier versions (such as v3.9) you need to raise a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal so that UKCloud OpenShift administrators can facilitate the expansion. Tip To check the version of your cluster, either click (?) in the top-right of the web UI and select About or run the following while connected in the CLI client: $ oc version ... Server https://console.5678-89abcd:8443 openshift v3.11.51 kubernetes v1.11.0+d4cacc0 Note You must scale down any pod or container using the volume before you can perform the expansion. Intended audience To complete the steps in this article, you must have access to a cluster that is running OpenShift Container Platform v3.11 (or newer). You must also have access to oc , the OpenShift command-line client (CLI). For more information, see OpenShift's Get Started with the CLI . Prerequisites If the cluster is v3.11 or newer, the storage class should be enabled for Volume Expansion. You can confirm this as follows: $ oc describe storageclass tier2 Name: tier2 IsDefaultClass: Yes Annotations: storageclass.beta.kubernetes.io/is-default-class=true Provisioner: kubernetes.io/cinder Parameters: availability=nova,type=TIER2 AllowVolumeExpansion: True MountOptions: <none> ReclaimPolicy: Delete VolumeBindingMode: Immediate Events: <none> Stop any pod that is using the volume In this article, we'll expand the volume for a cluster's default Elasticsearch deployment, which is located in the openshift-logging project. The pod using the persistent volume in this example is named logging-es-data-master and the pvc (Persistent Volume Claim) name is logging-es-0 . This is a common scenario - a high throughput of logs may cause Elasticsearch to enter a CrashLoop when the logging volume fills up. You can apply the same procedure to any other pods that use persistent volumes. Note In OpenShift v4, the cluster-logging components are named differently: the Elasticsearch pod is prefixed \"elasticsearch-cdm-\" and the pvc is prefixed \"elasticsearch-elasticsearch-cdm-\". In version 4, both Kibana and Elasticsearch are scaled using deployments rather than deployment configs. $ oc project openshift-logging Now using project \"openshift-logging\" on server \"https://console.5678-89abcd:8443\". $ oc get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE logging-es-data-master-7bqadxxd-1-wrlqh 2/2 Running 2 2d ... logging-kibana-1-n7j8t 2/2 Running 2 2d $ oc get dc NAME REVISION DESIRED CURRENT TRIGGERED BY logging-es-data-master-7bqadxxd 1 1 1 logging-kibana 1 1 1 config In this example, the logging-kibana pod depends on the logging-es-data-master pod so it's good practice to also scale this down during the expansion of the persistent volume for logging-es-data-master : $ for i in $(oc get dc | awk 'NR>1 {print $1}') ; do oc scale --replicas=0 dc $i; done deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/logging-kibana scaled deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/logging-es-data-master-7bqadxxd scaled # For a single deployment, generally: oc scale --replicas=0 dc <deployment_name> Confirm that the pod that uses the volume has been terminated: $ oc get pods | grep logging-es-data-master # (nothing returned) Resize the persistent volume Once the pod dependent on the volume is stopped, you can edit the pvc to resize the volume: $ oc get pvc NAME STATUS VOLUME CAPACITY ACCESS MODES STORAGECLASS AGE logging-es-0 Bound pvc-4ad7258e-12a6-11e9-bc9d-fa163e12bba5 20Gi RWO tier2 2d $ oc edit pvc logging-es-0 ... oc edit causes the configuration of the object to open in a text editor.

    "keywords": "How to expose non-http services externally Overview UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift enables you to develop, deploy, and manage digital and container-based applications seamlessly across local physical or virtual environments, with full portability to and from UKCloud. This article explains how you can expose services outside of your OpenShift cluster without using routes. Intended audience This article assumes familiarity with services and routes in OpenShift and access to an account with cluster-admin permissions. Prerequisites To complete the steps in this guide, your cluster must have been deployed from a version of our code that enables our non-http functionality. You can raise a Service Request to: Check if your cluster already provides non-http functionality Request a new cluster to be deployed incorporating our non-http functionality. Getting the external IP You'll need to raise a Service Request with us that provides the network you'd like to expose services on and the ports/protocols of the services you'll be exposing. We'll update your environment to create the virtual infrastructure needed and provide you with the publicly accessible IP and the local IP this maps to. The local IP will be important for the upcoming steps. Note You can request multiple ports/protocols and networks for external services. Exposing your service Now you need to create the service you would like to expose. Create the service as usual, then patch the local IP we gave you into the service as its external IP using the following command (the example uses a local IP of 10.2.1.120): oc patch svc <service_name> -p '{\"spec\":{\"externalIPs\":[\"10.2.1.120\"]}}' Deploying ipfailover OpenShift has a feature called ipfailover that you can use to make an external IP accessible on a subset of nodes in the cluster. Use ipfailover to make your service available on the external IP. Enter the following commands to deploy ipfailover (you must have cluster-admin permissions): oc create sa ipfailover oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z ipfailover oc adm ipfailover --virtual-ips=10.2.1.120 --watch-port=0 --replicas=<amount_of_compute_nodes> --selector=\"node-role.kubernetes.io/compute=true\" --vrrp-id-offset=0 --create You'll need to pass the IP you've patched into the service as an external IP, using the --virtual-ips argument. You can use any node-selector you like for the --selector argument but make sure it's a valid node label. You must set --watch-port to 0 for the ipfailover deployment to work. The --replicas argument should equal the amount of nodes matching your --selector label. You will need to increment --vrrp-id-offset by one for each ipfailover deployment in your cluster, for example to expose another external IP your command might look like the following: oc adm ipfailover --virtual-ips=10.2.1.121 --watch-port=0 --replicas=<amount_of_compute_nodes> --selector=\"node-role.kubernetes.io/compute=true\" --vrrp-id-offset=1 --create Note You can only deploy one instance of ipfailover per project. Also, the deployment may sometimes go into a pending state. If this happens ensure that you've incremented --vrrp-id-offset (if necessary) and have given the ipfailover service account the required permissions inside the project you are deploying in: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z ipfailover You can now access your service on the public IP tied to the external IP. Tip You can access multiple services on the same external IP, they just need to be running on a different port.

Note UKCloud engineers will sometimes need to add their user accounts (ending in *@ukcloud.com*) to your UKCloud Portal account and OpenShift environment to diagnose issues in response to customer tickets or monitoring alerts. The access will be removed when it is no longer required, however the user may continue to show in the output of the oc get users command. If you have any concerns about a user showing in your account, raise a service request for advice. Managing access to an OpenShift cluster Note If your cluster is using OpenShift Container Platform 3.9, raise a service request to add new users. Log in to the UKCloud Portal For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal . Note You must log in as a Portal administrator. If necessary, switch to the account that contains the services you want the user to be able to access. If the user does not already have a UKCloud Portal user account, you'll need to create an account for them first. For more information, see How to create a new user in the UKCloud Portal . To grant the user permissions to log into your OpenShift cluster, in the navigation panel, expand Contacts , then select All Contacts . On the Contacts page, use the Search field to find the user to whom you want to assign OpenShift permissions and then click the Edit button. On the Edit contact page, select the OpenShift Permissions tab. Select the check box(es) for the cluster(s) that you want the user to have access to, then click Save If you've enabled two-factor authentication (2FA) in the account that includes the OpenShift cluster and the user has set up 2FA for their user account, they'll be prompted to provide a 2FA code when logging in to OpenShift. Note By default, the user will be able to create new projects in OpenShift but they will be unable to view existing projects. Additional cluster or project roles can be added to the user if required.

    "keywords": "How to monitor your OpenShift cluster Overview UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift enables you to develop, deploy, and manage digital and container-based applications seamlessly across local physical or virtual environments, with full portability to and from UKCloud. This guide explains how you can set up a simple system to monitor an OpenShift cluster. Intended audience This guide assumes familiarity with the Linux command line, and with the oc command set to manage an OpenShift cluster. Prerequisites To complete the steps in this guide, you must have the oc command installed and have a suitable account on your OpenShift cluster. Specifically, it is assumed you know the authentication credentials that need to be supplied to oc login. Monitoring via the monitoring stack OpenShift clusters at UKCloud have a pre-installed monitoring stack enabling administrators and users to gain deeper insights into the health and performance of their clusters and applications. This monitoring stack is updated and maintained by Red Hat. You can see what monitoring has been set up by logging into the OpenShift console and selecting the Monitoring option in the navigation panel. The monitoring stack provides users with a centralised viewpoint for all alerts, events and statistics occuring in the cluster. By default, Red Hat has implemented monitoring for core components of the cluster such as the etcd, OpenShift API server, Image Registry and more. Enabling workload monitoring By default, workloads are not monitored. However, cluster administrators can enable monitoring for projects: Log in to OpenShift on the command line: oc login ... oc project openshift-monitoring Edit the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap: oc edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config Add the enableUserWorkload line in data/config.yaml : apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: cluster-monitoring-config namespace: openshift-monitoring data: config.yaml: | enableUserWorkload: true Save the file to apply the changes. [!NOTE] It may take a couple of minutes for the prometheus-operator , prometheus-user-workload and thanos-ruler-user-workload to create new pods. This will consume more vCPU, memory and disk resources on the infrastructure nodes. More information Red Hat provides detailed documentation to help you set up the metrics to collect from applications and the alerts that can be created from them. For more information, see: Managing Metrics Managing Alerts Monitoring via the OpenShift API All OpenShift clusters expose an API that you can use to gather alerts or statistics. Generating an authentication token The first step to using the API to monitor your OpenShift cluster is to create a service account within the cluster that your monitoring system can use, and create an authentication token for it. Tip The token may have already been created, so it's worth checking first. Log in to OpenShift on the command line: oc login ... oc project openshift-infra Check if a monitoring account already exists: oc get serviceaccount --all-namespaces | grep infra | \\ grep monitoring If the account exists, the command above prints the name, and you can move on to Reading the authentication token . If it prints nothing, you need to create the account as described in the remaining steps below. Create the monitoring account if it does not exist: oc create serviceaccount monitoring Add the role cluster-reader to the account: oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-reader \\ system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:monitoring Reading the authentication token Next, you need to retrieve the authentication token that you created in the previous step. If you haven't already done so, ensure you are logged in to OpenShift and connected to the right project: oc login ... oc project openshift-infra Find the name of the monitoring account's token IDs: oc describe serviceaccount monitoring This lists the IDs of one or more token names, for example, monitoring-token-1abc2 . Find the actual authentication token by querying the secret by the name given in the previous step, for example: oc describe secret <monitoring-token> Where monitoring-token is the token name you found in the previous step. This lists a few values, including the 179-character authentication token. Using the authentication token The OpenShift API provides a way of determining the health of the cluster; the data required to do this is obtainable by requesting the API at /api/vi/nodes . You must supply the authentication token in the HTTP Authorization header. The following example shows how to query this data from a shell command using curl. $ token=\"<authentication_token>\" $ endpoint= https://ocp.<my-cluster-url>.ukcloud.com:8443 $ curl -k -H \"Authorization: Bearer ${token}\" \\ -H 'Accept: application/json' ${endpoint}/api/v1/nodes You'll need to customise the query above by providing the correct values for endpoint and token. This API call returns a reasonable amount of JSON-encoded data, which may be hard to parse using shell commands. It's also necessary to fetch items from various places within this data. The Python program in the following section shows you how to accomplish this. Using the OpenShift API to obtain cluster status The code example below uses the OpenShift API to obtain information about the health of the cluster, and prints a summary showing if each node is healthy. It has been tested using Python 3.7. Tip The ENDPOINT parameter in the code is an example for OpenShift v3. For OpenShift v4 clusters, you'll need to change the port number from 8443 to 6443 . API URLs for OpenShift v4 begin with https://api. rather than https://ocp. . #!/usr/bin/env python3 import urllib.request import json import ssl def get_all_nodes(endpoint, token): \"\"\"Fetch the nodes data from the openshift cluster\"\"\" request = urllib.request.Request(endpoint + \"/api/v1/nodes\") request.add_header('Authorization', 'Bearer ' + token) request.add_header('Accept', 'application/json') ssl_context = None # or ssl._create_unverified_context() result = urllib.request.urlopen(request, context=ssl_context) return result.read() def get_status_from_node(data_item): \"\"\" Extract the status conditions from the data\"\"\" addresses = data_item['status']['addresses'] address = None for addr in addresses: if addr['type'] == 'Hostname': address = addr['address'] return {'hostname': address, 'conditions': data_item['status']['conditions']} def find_faults(cond_data): \"\"\" find whether each node is in a failed state\"\"\" cells = [] for node in cond_data: hostname = node['hostname'] state = 'OK ' for cond in node['conditions']: if cond['status'] != \"False\" and cond['type'] != \"Ready\": state = 'FAIL' elif cond['status'] != \"True\" and cond['type'] == \"Ready\": state = 'FAIL' cells.append('{} {} '.format(state, hostname)) return cells def main(): all_nodes = json.loads(get_all_nodes(ENDPOINT, TOKEN)) all_conditions = [] for node in all_nodes['items']: all_conditions.append(get_status_from_node(node)) print(\"Status of Cluster at {}\".format(ENDPOINT)) for node in find_faults(all_conditions): print(node) ENDPOINT = 'https://ocp.my-cluster-url.ukcloud.com:8443' TOKEN = 'eyJhb...the.179.char.token' main() Tip If you encounter problems copying and pasting the source code above, we also provide the code in the following blog post: https://ukcloud.com/hub/news/simple-openshift-monitoring/ Next steps For more information about UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift service, see: Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift FAQs Feedback If you find a problem with this article, click Improve this Doc to make the change yourself or raise an issue in GitHub.

    "title": "How to obtain usage metrics for OpenShift capacity management",
    "keywords": "How to obtain usage metrics for OpenShift capacity management Overview This article provides examples of the self-service commands you can execute against your UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift cluster to gain usage metrics and statistics to help manage your ongoing capacity requirements. A UKCloud deployed OpenShift cluster comprises a single Starter Pack, plus a number of Runtime Packs as required by your workload demands. Starter Pack - Provides the foundation OpenShift services to support the orchestration and management of the container runtime environments, along with additional infrastructure nodes to support services such as log aggregation and metric collection. Each customer environment requires only a single Starter Pack. Runtime Pack - Nodes on which your containerised applications and services run. You have the choice of difference size Runtime Packs. You can call off Runtime Packs individually, however, we strongly recommend the initial deployment of two or more Runtime Packs for production environments to provide resilience to your workloads in the event of the failure of a single Runtime Pack. To add or remove Runtime Packs, raise a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. The sections in this guide, show you how to obtain various statistics about the platform, including: Overall status of each node in the cluster CPU usage Memory usage Block storage consumption (used by persistent volumes) Object storage consumption (used by the registry) Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have access to and a working knowledge of oc , the OpenStack command-line client (CLI). For more information, see OpenShift's Get Started with the CLI . Identifying capacity statistics The OpenStack CLI provides the ability to list the nodes in your cluster and then retrieve status information about a specific node. You can use this information to determine if the nodes in your cluster have enough available disk space and memory. To obtain the list of nodes that make up the OpenStack cluster, enter the following command: oc get nodes The results show you the overall readiness of each node and their role. For example: $ oc get nodes NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION master-infra-0.5623-f84e8e Ready master 310d v1.11.0+d4cacc0 master-infra-1.5623-f84e8e Ready master 310d v1.11.0+d4cacc0 master-infra-2.5623-f84e8e Ready master 310d v1.11.0+d4cacc0 worker-infra-0.5623-f84e8e Ready infra 310d v1.11.0+d4cacc0 worker-infra-1.5623-f84e8e Ready infra 310d v1.11.0+d4cacc0 worker-tenant-s-0.5623-f84e8e Ready compute 310d v1.11.0+d4cacc0 worker-tenant-s-1.5623-f84e8e Ready compute 310d v1.11.0+d4cacc0 You can display a summary of the resource usage on each node using the following command: oc adm top nodes The results show the percentage and absolute value of CPU and MEMORY usage on each node. For example: $ oc adm top nodes NAME CPU(cores) CPU% MEMORY(bytes) MEMORY% master-infra-0.5623-f84e8e 276m 7% 3367Mi 22% master-infra-1.5623-f84e8e 258m 6% 3597Mi 23% master-infra-2.5623-f84e8e 370m 9% 4167Mi 27% worker-infra-0.5623-f84e8e 281m 15% 7697Mi 50% worker-infra-1.5623-f84e8e 566m 31% 7946Mi 52% worker-tenant-s-0.5623-f84e8e 405m 22% 12229Mi 80% worker-tenant-s-1.5623-f84e8e 258m 14% 2451Mi 16% Note For the oc adm top command to work, Hawkular metrics must be running in your cluster. This command can also report on images and pods. To find the detailed status of a node, enter the following command: oc describe node <nodename> The results show a large amount of information about disk status (pressure and out-of-disk), memory pressure and usage, CPU usage and resource consumption from any running pods. For example: $ oc describe node worker-tenant-s-0.5623-f84e8e Name: worker-tenant-s-0.5623-f84e8e Roles: compute Labels: beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64 beta.kubernetes.io/instance-type=363e3898-1fb5-4d7f-b0b6-9466fe2448c2 beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region=regionOne failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone=00021-2 internet=true kubernetes.io/hostname=worker-tenant-s-0.5623-f84e8e logging-infra-fluentd=true node-role.kubernetes.io/compute=true tenant=true Annotations: node.openshift.io/md5sum=5d575cf13ea3d2813ed294fa00e72234 volumes.kubernetes.io/controller-managed-attach-detach=true CreationTimestamp: Mon, 07 Jan 2019 17:50:31 +0000 Taints: <none> Unschedulable: false Conditions: Type Status LastHeartbeatTime LastTransitionTime Reason Message ---- ------ ----------------- ------------------ ------ ------- OutOfDisk False Thu, 14 Nov 2019 10:13:12 +0000 Mon, 04 Nov 2019 14:44:23 +0000 KubeletHasSufficientDisk kubelet has sufficient disk space available MemoryPressure False Thu, 14 Nov 2019 10:13:12 +0000 Mon, 04 Nov 2019 14:44:23 +0000 KubeletHasSufficientMemory kubelet has sufficient memory available DiskPressure False Thu, 14 Nov 2019 10:13:12 +0000 Mon, 04 Nov 2019 14:44:23 +0000 KubeletHasNoDiskPressure kubelet has no disk pressure PIDPressure False Thu, 14 Nov 2019 10:13:12 +0000 Mon, 07 Jan 2019 17:50:31 +0000 KubeletHasSufficientPID kubelet has sufficient PID available Ready True Thu, 14 Nov 2019 10:13:12 +0000 Mon, 04 Nov 2019 14:44:23 +0000 KubeletReady kubelet is posting ready status Addresses: InternalIP: 10.3.1.7 Hostname: worker-tenant-s-0.5623-f84e8e Capacity: cpu: 2 hugepages-1Gi: 0 hugepages-2Mi: 0 memory: 16266524Ki pods: 250 Allocatable: cpu: 1800m hugepages-1Gi: 0 hugepages-2Mi: 0 memory: 15639836Ki pods: 250 System Info: Machine ID: 4c43666486044496beef8fc81fdda75a System UUID: 4C436664-8604-4496-BEEF-8FC81FDDA75A Boot ID: e95bc874-b6d2-4284-9215-e589c91836a2 Kernel Version: 3.10.0-1062.4.1.el7.x86_64 OS Image: Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 7.7 (Maipo) Operating System: linux Architecture: amd64 Container Runtime Version: docker://1.13.1 Kubelet Version: v1.11.0+d4cacc0 Kube-Proxy Version: v1.11.0+d4cacc0 ProviderID: openstack:///4c436664-8604-4496-beef-8fc81fdda75a Non-terminated Pods: (58 in total) Namespace Name CPU Requests CPU Limits Memory Requests Memory Limits --------- ---- ------------ ---------- --------------- ------------- argo argo-ui-78b65f59b5-s2fgh 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) argo workflow-controller-685875596-4cttz 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) backup-test ruby-ex-2-gj927 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) bluegreen blue-1-nkgr5 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) bluegreen green-1-h2n6z 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) connect-test ruby-ex-1-597fv 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) development myapp-1-4sws5 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) locust-ingress ruby-ex-1-l7dcc 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) locust locust-master-1-v6q69 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) pytest pytest-3-gfdt8 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) new-backup-test ruby-ex-1-8fk75 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) openshift-logging logging-fluentd-ktvkm 100m (5%) 0 (0%) 756Mi (4%) 756Mi (4%) openshift-monitoring node-exporter-h6czw 10m (0%) 20m (1%) 20Mi (0%) 40Mi (0%) openshift-node sync-krb68 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) openshift-sdn ovs-nfbjx 100m (5%) 0 (0%) 300Mi (1%) 0 (0%) openshift-sdn sdn-lsbft 100m (5%) 0 (0%) 200Mi (1%) 0 (0%) postgres postgresql-3-wr7gq 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 512Mi (3%) 512Mi (3%) samplepipeline jenkins-1-862f5 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 512Mi (3%) 512Mi (3%) samplepipeline mongodb-1-jzvgd 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 512Mi (3%) 512Mi (3%) samplepipeline nodejs-mongodb-example-1-74qlc 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 512Mi (3%) 512Mi (3%) testproject cotd-2-cnkvq 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) ...

Identifying block storage consumption For capacity management, it's also useful to know much block storage your cluster is using. To obtain block storage consumption (persistent volumes) information, enter the following command: oc get pv The results will look similar to the following, where we can see there is one item consuming 50 GB of storage. $ oc get pv NAME CAPACITY ACCESS MODES RECLAIM POLICY STATUS CLAIM STORAGECLASS REASON AGE pvc-08237e69-cff9-11e9-a9ef-fa163e5c5959 5Gi RWO Delete Bound postgres/postgresql tier2 69d pvc-4da7258e-12a6-11e9-ad9d-fa163e12bba5 22Gi RWO Delete Bound openshift-logging/logging-es-0 tier2 310d pvc-58268285-12a5-11e9-ad4e-fa163e5c5959 50Gi RWO Delete Bound openshift-monitoring/prometheus-k8s-db-prometheus-k8s-0 tier2 310d pvc-88a3dfdc-12a5-11e9-ad4e-fa163e5c5959 50Gi RWO Delete Bound openshift-monitoring/prometheus-k8s-db-prometheus-k8s-1 tier2 310d pvc-ac9597cc-12a5-11e9-ad4e-fa163e5c5959 2Gi RWO Delete Bound openshift-monitoring/alertmanager-main-db-alertmanager-main-0 tier2 310d pvc-bf06155b-12a5-11e9-ad4e-fa163e5c5959 2Gi RWO Delete Bound openshift-monitoring/alertmanager-main-db-alertmanager-main-1 tier2 310d pvc-bf2656a8-12a5-11e9-ad9d-fa163e12bba5 10Gi RWO Delete Bound openshift-infra/metrics-cassandra-1 tier2 310d pvc-e61b15ac-12a5-11e9-ad4e-fa163e5c5959 2Gi RWO Delete Bound openshift-monitoring/alertmanager-main-db-alertmanager-main-2 tier2 310d Identifying object storage consumption Object storage is used only for the OpenShift registry, therefore, you can calculate how much object storage your cluster is using by adding up the resources in the registry.

    "keywords": "How to publish application routes to multiple networks Overview This article provides instructions on how to make use of multiple external networks from within an OpenShift cluster. If you've requested an OpenShift cluster with multiple networks from UKCloud you'll have multiple data planes - usually one for the internet and one for the community network you’ve requested be added to your deployment. Building applications that listen on these networks is relatively straightforward but requires some specific configuration to be put in place on your application routes. This guide should help explain how you go about exposing your application on the relevant networks. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have access to and a working knowledge of oc , the OpenShift command-line client (CLI). For more information, see OpenShift's Get Started with the CLI . High level overview Firstly, an explanation of what gets deployed: the cluster will have front-end load balancers that sit outside OpenShift, which essentially do TCP passthrough of incoming traffic to the OpenShift routers deployed inside your cluster. As a cluster administrator, you can see the OpenShift routers by viewing the default project. You'll also have another set of routers that run on the community network facing nodes that provide termination of inbound traffic from the community network. The three scenarios shown in the above diagram are as follows: Traffic from the internet to application-1 (blue lines) Traffic from the internet and a community network to application-2 (green and red lines) Traffic from a community network to application-3 only (purple lines) We'll be using some basic example applications to demonstrate publishing routes in each of these three application scenarios. Process and code examples Scenario 1 - Traffic from the internet to application-1 First, we'll create a project called routersharding and the three applications to demonstrate with: $ oc new-project routersharding Now using project \"routersharding\" on server \"https://console.x-y-zzz-abcdef:8443\". $ oc new-app centos/ruby-22-centos7~https://github.com/openshift/ruby-ex.git --name=application-1 $ oc new-app centos/ruby-22-centos7~https://github.com/openshift/ruby-ex.git --name=application-2 $ oc new-app centos/ruby-22-centos7~https://github.com/openshift/ruby-ex.git --name=application-3 $ oc get svc NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE application-1 ClusterIP x.y.144.215 <none> 8080/TCP 1m application-2 ClusterIP x.y.122.177 <none> 8080/TCP 1m application-3 ClusterIP x.y.247.162 <none> 8080/TCP 1m $ oc expose svc application-1 route \"application-1\" exposed $ oc get routes NAME HOST/PORT PATH SERVICES PORT TERMINATION WILDCARD application-1 application-1-routersharding.demo-env.region1.cna.ukcloud.com application-1 8080-tcp None Now to see that your route has been published, you can describe the route and see where it's been exposed, or you can review the routes in the default router by opening a session to the router pod and reviewing the configuration. Find a router pod - in this case labelled router-<buildno>-<uniqueid> : $ oc project default Now using project \"default\" on server \"https://console.x-y-zzz-abcdef:8443\". $ oc get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE docker-registry-1-466xv 1/1 Running 0 16h registry-console-2-bff2q 1/1 Running 0 18h router-4-bjqz2 1/1 Running 0 8h router-4-q5g6g 1/1 Running 0 8h router-secondary-2-f2p8z 1/1 Running 0 1d router-secondary-2-nr2lm 1/1 Running 0 15d Remotely launch an interactive shell in a router and look at the routes.json file to see our route is published: $ oc rsh router-4-bjqz2 sh-4.2$ cat /var/lib/haproxy/router/routes.json | grep application-1-routersharding \"Host\": \"application-1-routersharding.demo-env.region1.cna.ukcloud.com\", Similarly, we can see that no routes are currently published on the router-secondary pods: $ oc get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE docker-registry-1-466xv 1/1 Running 0 1h registry-console-2-bff2q 1/1 Running 0 3h router-1-6fzkh 1/1 Running 0 1h router-1-pzjrj 1/1 Running 0 50d router-secondary-2-f2p8z 1/1 Running 0 1d router-secondary-2-nr2lm 1/1 Running 0 15d $ oc rsh router-secondary-2-f2p8z sh-4.2$ cat /var/lib/haproxy/router/routes.json {} So that shows the basic route is now published, which fulfils scenario 1 shown in the diagram above. Scenario 2 - Traffic from the internet and a community network to application-2 To make the route appear on the secondary router and achieve scenario 2, we need to label the route appropriately so that it's also exposed on the router-secondary pods. By default, we setup the secondary routers with a label based route selector of \"router-secondary=true\" . Here we see the route selector label setup on the secondary router. This indicates that this route will publish routes that are labelled with \"router-secondary=true\" : $ oc describe dc router-secondary | grep ROUTE_LABELS ROUTE_LABELS: router-secondary=true Now we need to switch back to our application project and make the changes to our application b to meet scenario 2: $ oc project routersharding Now using project \"routersharding\" on server \"https://console.x-y-zzz-abcdef:8443\". First, we expose the route on the default router as before: $ oc expose svc application-2 route \"application-2\" exposed # we can apply the label to expose our route on the secondary router with the following command $ oc label route application-2 \"router-secondary=true\" route \"application-2\" labeled By describing the route, we can now see it's been exposed on both routers (see exposed on lines below): $ oc describe route application-2 Name: application-2 Namespace: routersharding Created: 3 minutes ago Labels: app=application-2 router-secondary=true Annotations: openshift.io/host.generated=true Requested Host: application-2-routersharding.demo-env.region1.cna.ukcloud.com exposed on router router 3 minutes ago exposed on router router-secondary 2 minutes ago Path: <none> TLS Termination: <none> Insecure Policy: <none> Endpoint Port: 8080-tcp Service: application-2 Weight: 100 (100%) Endpoints: 10.128.4.24:8080 Reviewing the routes on the router-secondary pods as before also shows our route now exposed there: $ oc rsh router-secondary-2-f2p8z sh-4.2$ cat /var/lib/haproxy/router/routes.json { \"routersharding:application-2\": { \"Name\": \"application-2\", \"Namespace\": \"routersharding\", \"Host\": \"application-2-routersharding.demo-env.region1.cna.ukcloud.com\", \"Path\": \"\", \"TLSTermination\": \"\", \"Certificates\": null, \"VerifyServiceHostname\": false, \"Status\": \"saved\", \"PreferPort\": \"8080-tcp\", \"InsecureEdgeTerminationPolicy\": \"\", \"RoutingKeyName\": \"8647b1a7d5f913923a2eae0e1d02df09\", \"IsWildcard\": false, \"Annotations\": { \"openshift.io/host.generated\": \"true\" }, \"ServiceUnits\": { \"routersharding/application-2\": 100 }, \"ServiceUnitNames\": { \"routersharding/application-2\": 256 }, \"ActiveServiceUnits\": 1, \"ActiveEndpoints\": 1 } } Scenario 3 - Traffic from a community network to application-3 only The final scenario for application-3 requires modification of the original routers to ensure they don’t select routes with a specific label (by default they expose all of the routes we expose). We’ll recreate the same application in a new project called test-project1 to demonstrate this. First, we edit the existing default router to tell it not to select routes that have a label of isolated=true : $ oc project default Now using project \"default\" on server \"https://console.x-y-zzz-abcdef:8443\". $ oc set env dc/router ROUTE_LABELS='isolated != true' deploymentconfig \"router” updated We can now create a new basic route with that label and see that it doesn't appear on any router: $ oc expose svc application-3 --labels=\"isolated=true\" route \"application-3\" exposed $ oc describe route application-3 Name: application-3 Namespace: routersharding Created: 19 seconds ago Labels: isolated=true Annotations: openshift.io/host.generated=true Requested Host: application-3-routersharding.demo-env.region1.cna.ukcloud.com Path: <none> TLS Termination: <none> Insecure Policy: <none> Endpoint Port: 8080-tcp Service: application-3 Weight: 100 (100%) Endpoints: 10.129.2.20:8080 Notice that this doesn't appear to be exposed on any routers. We can check this on the routers quickly as we have previously: $ oc project default Now using project \"default\" on server \"https://console.x-y-zzz-abcdef:8443\". $ oc rsh router-4-bjqz2 sh-4.2$ cat /var/lib/haproxy/router/routes.json | grep application-3-routersharding <no results> Similarly, it's not appearing on our secondary router either: $ oc rsh router-secondary-2-f2p8z sh-4.2$ cat /var/lib/haproxy/router/routes.json | grep application-3-routersharding <no results> Now we can just expose this route on the secondary routers by tagging it with the appropriate label for those routers: $ oc project routersharding Now using project \"routersharding\" on server \"https://console.x-y-zzz-abcdef:8443\". $ oc label route application-3 \"router-secondary=true\" route \"application-3\" labeled $ oc describe route application-3 Name: application-3 Namespace: routersharding Created: 3 minutes ago Labels: isolated=true router-secondary=true Annotations: openshift.io/host.generated=true Requested Host: application-3-routersharding.demo-env.region1.cna.ukcloud.com exposed on router router-secondary 4 seconds ago Path: <none> TLS Termination: <none> Insecure Policy: <none> Endpoint Port: 8080-tcp Service: application-3 Weight: 100 (100%) Endpoints: 10.129.2.20:8080 # notice how this route now is showing as exposed on router-secondary. We can verify this as before. $ oc project default Now using project \"default\" on server \"https://console.x-y-zzz-abcdef:8443\". $ oc rsh router-secondary-2-f2p8z $ oc rsh router-secondary-2-f2p8z sh-4.2$ cat /var/lib/haproxy/router/routes.json { \"routersharding:application-2\": { \"Name\": \"application-2\", \"Namespace\": \"routersharding\", \"Host\": \"application-2-routersharding.demo-env.region1.cna.ukcloud.com\", \"Path\": \"\", \"TLSTermination\": \"\", \"Certificates\": null, \"VerifyServiceHostname\": false, \"Status\": \"saved\", \"PreferPort\": \"8080-tcp\", \"InsecureEdgeTerminationPolicy\": \"\", \"RoutingKeyName\": \"8647b1a7d5f913923a2eae0e1d02df09\", \"IsWildcard\": false, \"Annotations\": { \"openshift.io/host.generated\": \"true\" }, \"ServiceUnits\": { \"routersharding/application-2\": 100 }, \"ServiceUnitNames\": { \"routersharding/application-2\": 256 }, \"ActiveServiceUnits\": 1, \"ActiveEndpoints\": 1 }, \"routersharding:application-3\": { \"Name\": \"application-3\", \"Namespace\": \"routersharding\", \"Host\": \"application-3-routersharding.demo-env.region1.cna.ukcloud.com\", \"Path\": \"\", \"TLSTermination\": \"\", \"Certificates\": null, \"VerifyServiceHostname\": false, \"Status\": \"\", \"PreferPort\": \"8080-tcp\", \"InsecureEdgeTerminationPolicy\": \"\", \"RoutingKeyName\": \"187190814c4acaea9156fd0ca476bd4f\", \"IsWildcard\": false, \"Annotations\": { \"openshift.io/host.generated\": \"true\" }, \"ServiceUnits\": { \"routersharding/application-3\": 100 }, \"ServiceUnitNames\": null, \"ActiveServiceUnits\": 1, \"ActiveEndpoints\": 0 } } The above shows both the routes we've created in this demo now on router-secondary . Note If you want to expose applications on a private network, the above logic still applies. The only differences are that the deployment config for the router is called router-private and the route label required to expose your routes is router-private=true .

    "keywords": "How to restrict access to OpenShift routes by IP address Overview This knowledge centre article explains how OpenShift developers can restrict access to the routes they create to their deployed services in OpenShift by IP address. Restricting access in this way increases the security of a route by allowing only trusted IPs to access the OpenShift route. Intended audience OpenShift developers who have created and deployed services into OpenShift, and created and exposed routes for those services. This article describes how to further secure access to those exposed routes by allowing only trusted IPs to access them. Restricting access to a route After creating and exposing a route in OpenShift in the usual manner, you can then add an annotation to the route specifying the IP address(es) that you would like to add to the allow-list. Important Adding this annotation for an IP address or list of addresses/subnets automatically denies all traffic from addresses outside this list. You apply the annotation to a route in the following manner: oc annotate route <route_name> haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist=\"<ip_address>\" Important You must do this for every route that you wish to apply the restriction to. Examples To allow a single IP address through to the route, use the following: oc annotate route <route_name> haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist=\"192.168.1.10\" To allow several IP addresses through to the route, separate each IP with a space (do not use commas to separate IPs): oc annotate route <route_name> haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist=\"192.168.1.10 192.168.1.11 192.168.1.12\" To allow a CIDR block through to the route, declare the CIDR block as so: oc annotate route <route_name> haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist=\"192.168.1.10/24\" You can even use a mix of IP addresses and a CIDR block: oc annotate route <route_name> haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist=\"192.168.1.10 180.5.61.153 192.168.1.0/24 10.0.0.0/8\" To delete the IPs from the annotation, you can run the command: oc annotate route <route_name> haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist- Known issues As of OpenShift version 4.4+, pod DNS lookups will return the internal IP of a route rather than the public IP. This means traffic will not leave the cluster for pod to route communication. For a route with an allow-list to accept traffic from a pod in the same cluster, you must add the internal cluster subnet to the allow-list rather than the cluster's egress IP. The following examples show a lookup from a local client machine and from inside a pod, demonstrating the difference in resolution: DNS lookup on local machine: DNS lookup from inside a pod: In this case you would run the following command to apply an allow-list to your route (assuming your cluster local subnet is 10.0.0.0/24): oc annotate route <route_name> haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist=\"10.0.0.0/24\" More information For further information, see the following OpenShift documentation: OpenShift v3 OpenShift v4 Important This functionality is available by default in UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift deployments of version 3.10 or later. For all previous versions, you must raise a request with UKCloud to have this functionality enabled.

These are objects that define the configuration of worker nodes, and can be scaled to set the number of workers of that type in the cluster. Scaling an OpenShift v4 cluster To view available MachineSets and their current scale, check the Compute ... MachineSets section of the OpenShift web console, or run the following oc command: oc get MachineSets -n openshift-machine-api To scale a MachineSet up or down, set the scale against the MachineSet in the OpenShift web console, or run: oc scale MachineSet <machinesetname> -n openshift-machine-api --replicas=<scale> Where <machinesetname> is the name of the MachineSet to scale, and <scale> is the number of workers desired from that MachineSet. After approximately three minutes, the new nodes should be visible in the OpenShift web console or in the output of: oc get nodes Note When you scale down a MachineSet, some workers will be drained and deleted. Workloads will automatically restart on remaining nodes if sufficient capacity remains. If all worker MachineSets are scaled to \"0\", workloads may stop completely. Default MachineSets available UKCloud offers three charging models for OpenShift workers: Hourly - This is charged by the hour, with a one hour minimum charge. Monthly - This is charged by the month, with a one month minimum charge. However, when used for the entire month, the cost is lower than running a hourly worker for the entire month. Annual - This is charged by the year, with a one year minimum charge. However, when used for the entire year, the cost is lower than running a monthly worker for the entire year. If you'd like to add annual MachineSets to your cluster, raise a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal and provide us with the size and network connectivity of the MachineSets you'd like to add. Hourly MachineSets are particularly useful for short-term testing or for bursts of demand. By default, UKCloud OpenShift clusters have the following MachineSets available: <clusterid>-hourly-m1-medium - 4 CPU, 16GB RAM, charged by the hour <clusterid>-monthly-m1-medium - 4 CPU, 16GB RAM, charged by the month <clusterid>-hourly-r1-small - 8 CPU, 16GB RAM, charged by the hour <clusterid>-monthly-r1-small - 8 CPU, 16GB RAM, charged by the month <clusterid>-hourly-m1-large - 4 CPU, 32B RAM, charged by the hour <clusterid>-monthly-m1-large - 4 CPU, 32GB RAM, charged by the month <clusterid>-hourly-r1-medium - 8 CPU, 32GB RAM, charged by the hour <clusterid>-monthly-r1-medium - 8 CPU, 32GB RAM, charged by the month For information about costs for each flavour and charging model, see section 2.1.3 of the UKCloud Pricing Guide .

Using the API To query the API, you must be authenticated as a user that has reader permissions on the OpenShift project that contains the Hawkular-Tenant you are querying. If you are querying the _system tenant then you must also have cluster-reader permissions. To get a list of all node level counters and gauges you can use, run the following: curl -X GET https://hawkular-metrics.$(cluster-url)/hawkular/metrics/metrics \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"Hawkular-Tenant: _system\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer $token\" Where $token is a variable storing the output of oc whoami -t from an OpenShift user with the correct permissions to view metrics and $cluster-url is the domain suffix of your cluster. For example, if your cluster URL is https://ocp.openshift-test.cna.ukcloud.com:8443 , your query would be the following: curl -X GET https://hawkular-metrics.openshift-test.cna.ukcloud.com/hawkular/metrics/metrics \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"Hawkular-Tenant: _system\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer $token\" You'll need to pass the output from the request into some form of JSON parser to get human readable results.

    "title": "How to use NetworkPolicy objects to connect services",
    "keywords": "How to use NetworkPolicy objects to connect services between projects Overview In OpenShift v3.11 clusters deployed from mid-February 2019, the default SDN plugin has been changed from ovs-multitenant to ovs-networkpolicy. This gives you the ability to create NetworkPolicy objects which allow granular control over the flow of communication between the pods, services and projects inside your cluster. By default, we create a NetworkPolicy object, named allow-from-same-and-privileged-namespaces , in every project, including those created after the cluster is deployed. This object allows all pods to communicate with each other inside the same project and allows communication from all pods and services to the default and openshift-monitoring projects. This mirrors the default pod security provided with the ovs-multitenant plugin. This document refers to namespaces and projects. A project is an OpenShift construct on top of a Kubernetes namespace. For the purpose of this guide they can be thought of as the same thing, however, the oc label commands that are performed on a namespace must be applied to the namespace object, they will not work if you attempt to apply them to the project object. Verifying the cluster SDN In order to verify if the cluster has the ovs-networkpolicy SDN you can use the following command: oc get clusternetwork This will show redhat/openshift-ovs-networkpolicy under the PLUGIN NAME. If this shows ovs-multitenant instead and you wish to use NetworkPolicy objects you will need to raise a service request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal to look at the options for switching SDN. Note You need to have cluster-reader or higher privilege in the cluster for this command to work. Interacting with NetworkPolicy objects You can interact with NetworkPolicy objects from the command line using the full name networkpolicy or short name netpol, for example: oc get netpol - List NetworkPolicy objects in the current project. oc describe netpol <name> - Provides more detailed information on the named NetworkPolicy object. oc get netpol <name> -o yaml - Provides yaml output of the named NetworkPolicy object. Useful to reference existing rules when creating new objects. Example of connecting services from two different projects NetworkPolicy objects are scoped at the project level. This means if you create a NetworkPolicy object using a template it will be created inside the project you're in and the rules will apply to pods within that project, with the exception of remote projects you may be referencing inside the rule. The object without any rules will look like the following: apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: <desired_name_of_object> namespace: <desired_project> (if not provided this will default to the project you are in when you run oc create) spec: Inside the spec key, you can pass in rules that determine what the NetworkPolicy object does. The first thing you need to consider is the pods you want to target. You can do this using the podSelector key. You can use this to match all pods in a project or alternatively to match all pods with a certain label. You can leave the key blank to match all pods in a project or you can match all pods with a certain label. In our example, we want to match pods with the label role=webserver : apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: webserver-egress namespace: webserver spec: podSelector: matchLabels: role: webserver We've matched the pods inside our webserver project that have the label role=webserver . Now we want to allow these pods to connect to a service inside a project we've named database. To do this, we'll use a namespace selector, which evaluates projects based on a label. In this case, we're going to be looking for the namespace label database=true . First, we need to ensure that this label is applied using the following command: Note The cluster administrator role is required to add labels to namespaces. oc label namespace database database=true Our example NetworkPolicy object now looks like the following: apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: webserver-egress namespace: webserver spec: podSelector: matchLabels: role: webserver egress: - to: - namespaceSelector: matchLabels: database: \"true\" We now have a template for a NetworkPolicy object that matches any pods labelled role=webserver inside the webserver project and allows them to communicate out to any projects labelled database=true . This is only half the work; we still need the ingress allowance inside the database project. Our example template for that object looks like the following: apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: database-ingress namespace: database spec: podSelector: matchLabels: role: database ingress: - from: - namespaceSelector: matchLabels: webserver: \"true\" This object is created in the database project and matches any pods in the project with the label role=database and allows ingress traffic from any project labelled webserver=true . To achieve our desired outcome, we need to label our webserver project as follows: Note The cluster administrator role is required to add labels to namespaces. oc label namespace webserver webserver=true In our example, we've saved our templates in files called netpol.yaml and netpol1.yaml. Use the following commands to create the objects, substituting in the relevant filename: oc create -f netpol.yaml oc create -f netpol1.yaml Now we've created the objects, any pods inside the webserver project matching the label role=webserver can communicate out to the service inside the database project exposed by pods matching the label role=database . Note You can test connectivity by curling the desired target service from the terminal of a pod that has been allowed access to the service. You can find the terminal in the UI or use oc rsh to enter the pod.

Useful to reference existing rules when creating new objects. Note If you delete the default NetworkPolicy objects from a project, that project's Pod IPs and services will be accessible from all other projects.

In our example, we want to match pods with the label role=webserver : apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: webserver-ingess namespace: database spec: podSelector: matchLabels: role: webserver Matching all pods in specific projects using namespaceSelector clauses Alternatively, you may want to allow all pods in one or more project(s) to connect to a service inside the \"database\" project. To do this, use a namespace selector, which evaluates projects based on a label. In our example, we're going to be looking for the namespace label webserveraccess=true . First, we need to ensure that this label is applied to one or more project(s) using the following command: Note Your user must have cluster-admin privileges to add labels to namespaces and to create NetworkPolicies. oc label namespace exampleproject webserveraccess=true apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: webserver-namespace-access namespace: database spec: namespaceSelector: matchLabels: webserveraccess: true In our example, we've saved our templates in files called netpol.yaml . Use the following command to create the object, substituting in the relevant filename: oc create -f netpol.yaml Note You can test connectivity by curling the desired target service from the terminal of a pod that has been allowed access to the service. You can find the terminal in the UI or use oc rsh to enter the pod.

    "keywords": "Supported customer update strategy for version 4 clusters Update Information In OpenShift version 4, updates of the cluster and operating system of the nodes have been exposed to the customer through the cluster. You can update clusters through the UI and the cluster will then deal with updating the relevant operator components and the OS version of the RHCOS nodes running as control planes, infras and workers. The OS version of the nodes is tied to the version of the cluster and is thoroughly tested by Red Hat pipelines prior to release. Supported Strategy There are three update channels available to choose from: Stable - This is the recommended channel for production clusters. Updates are released to this channel after data has been collected by Red Hat from customers running updates from the fast channel and stability of the updates has been confirmed. Fast - This channel is fully supported. Updates are released to this channel after performing well in the candidate channel. Candidate - This is an unsupported channel that will provide release candidate z stream releases. Do not update via this channel or both UKCloud and Red Hat will be unable to support the cluster. Note UKCloud asks that all customers remain on the stable channel for production clusters. We recommend using the fast channel only if you require specific bug fixes or security patches. Upgrading your cluster Prerequisites You must be a cluster admin user Process In the UI, navigate to Administration > Cluster Settings . Ensure the correct channel is selected. If an update is available there will be a large blue Update Now button. Click Update Now . In the Update Cluster dialog box, from the Select New Version list, select the version to upgrade to, then click Update . This will return you to the cluster settings screen where you can see the updates progress represented as a percentage. Mandatory updates We require customers to remain no further than one (1) minor version behind the latest release. This means when 4.x is released you must be running 4.x-1 at a minimum. This ensures that we can apply security and bug fixes in a timely manner to minimise any risk to your applications. If you're still running 4.x-2 or older two weeks after the release of 4.x we'll reach out, via a service request in the name of the main contact, to arrange an upgrade. If a month after the release of 4.x the update has not been applied UKCloud will initiate the update on behalf of the customer.

This article explains how you can view the connection logs generated by the squid proxy in your OpenShift cluster to identify potential connection issues, such as attempting to access endpoints that aren't on the allow-list. Prerequisites Your OpenShift cluster must have access to multiple networks, be version 3.11, and must have proxy logging enabled. Any OpenShift clusters deployed from November 2019 will have proxy logging enabled. Viewing logs In multi-network 3.11 clusters, we run a proxy service on the control plane load balancers to access Red Hat's container registry registry.redhat.io during the deployment and scaling process. The proxy also allows you to enable controlled access to internet endpoints from all nodes, providing you pass the correct variables to your pods and have added the endpoint to your allow-list. You may inadvertently be traversing the proxy when you do not want to or attempting to hit endpoints that are not on the allow-list, which will cause you to get 403 forbidden messages in the logs. The proxy logs contain information about these denials. As a customer, while you don't have direct access to the proxy logs, we send them through to a set of fluentd pods in a project called proxy-showback . These logs are then forwarded on to the clusters' aggregated logging and you can view them in the Kibana dashboard in the openshift-logging project, usually available on kibana.<cluster_domain_suffix> Set a filter of kubernetes_namespace_name: \"proxy-showback\" to filter only for the logs from the pods receiving the proxy logs and show only the message. You can then query the message field for the particular IP/endpoint you're looking for. From here you can see if it's being denied and update the allow-list as needed.

    "title": "OpenShift integrated cluster monitoring",
    "keywords": "OpenShift integrated cluster monitoring Overview OpenShift 3.11 ships with a pre-configured and self-updating monitoring stack based on the Prometheus open source project. The main components are Prometheus, Alertmanager and Grafana. This ships with a set of alerts that notify the cluster admin of problems and a set of Grafana dashboards. The deployed Prometheus instance is responsible for monitoring and alerting on cluster and OpenShift components. While it will enable you to monitor the compute resources of your pods using the K8s / Compute Resources / Pod Grafana dashboard, it shouldn't be extended to monitor user applications. Users interested in leveraging Prometheus for application monitoring on OpenShift should consider using the operator lifecycle manager ( https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager ) to easily deploy a Prometheus Operator and setup new Prometheus instances to monitor and alert on their applications. Alertmanager is a cluster-global component for handling alerts generated by all Prometheus instances deployed in that cluster. Resource Cluster monitoring is deployed with persistent storage, meaning that the metrics are stored on a persistent volume and can survive a pod being restarted or recreated. By default, each of the three Alertmanager instances is allocated 2GiB and the two Prometheus instances are allocated 50GiB each. This means 106GiB of storage will be used for cluster monitoring. If the persistent volumes fill up, or you notice them getting close to being full, you can expand the persistent volumes by following the steps in How to expand OpenShift persistent volumes or by raising a Service Request in the UKCloud Portal. Configuration If you'd like to change the behaviour of Alertmanager, for example, have alerts notify somebody by email, you'll need to raise a Service Request with us via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. In the request let us know the cluster and the Alertmanager configuration you'd like to be used and we can then reconfigure the cluster-monitoring using the OpenShift ansible playbooks used to deploy it. If you attempt to edit the configMaps or secrets directly to insert this configuration, the cluster-monitoring operator will detect these changes and restore default values. You can use the following documentation page as a reference when creating Alertmanager config: https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/configuration/ . Note The OCP 3.11 delivery of the Prometheus Alertmanager only includes a default template. Configurations requiring a specific template should be avoided as they may lead to failures to reconfigure the cluster-monitoring. It is possible to inject additional configuration into the stack. However, this is unsupported by Red Hat, as configuration paradigms might change across Prometheus releases, and such cases can only be handled gracefully if all configuration possibilities are controlled. Accessing Web UIs oc get routes -n openshift-monitoring will give you the URLs you can use to access Prometheus, Alertmanager and Grafana UIs. You'll need to prepend https:// to the addresses. Grafana Dashboards If you navigate to the Grafana web UI you'll be able to access a number of pre-configured dashboards. These dashboards provide insight into the compute resource usage at cluster, node and pod levels. There are also USE Method dashboards, monitoring Utilisation, Saturation and Errors, at the cluster and node level. Click the dropdown in the top left on the home dashboard to select which dashboard you'd like to view. Configuring custom dashboards isn't a supported option. If you require custom dashboards we recommend standing up your own grafana instance and connecting that into the cluster monitoring Prometheus.

    "keywords": "Deploying an application into OpenShift Service Mesh Overview Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh (OSM) provides an easy way to create a network of deployed services that provides discovery, load balancing, service-to-service authentication, failure recovery, metrics and monitoring. OSM is based on the open source Istio project. This article explains how to deploy a cloud-native sample application into OSM and highlights some key differences with using OSM compared to Istio. Intended audience This article is intended for teams familiar with OpenShift, microservices and the service mesh concept who are preparing to deploy microservices into OpenShift Service Mesh. Prerequisites Familiarity with the concepts involved in a Service Mesh. The OpenShift Service Mesh (OSM) Operator is installed into your OpenShift cluster. See the OpenShift documentation for an installation guide. The istio-system project exists and the target project for the sample application deployment has been added to the OSM ServiceMeshMemberRole configuration. Preparing services for deployment Sidecar injection The OSM uses the same Envoy proxy sidecar container as Istio does to manage traffic within the service mesh. OSM requires deployments to specify the annotation sidecar.istio.io/inject: \"true\" to opt-in to the sidecar injection. Traffic ingress Incoming traffic must enter the Service Mesh via a route that the Service Mesh has created. A route will be automatically created for every instance of a gateway. Replace any explicit route creation with gateways. When using the istio-system as a multi-tenant control plane, each ingress needs a VirtualService instance, which defines the traffic routing at the point of ingress. As a minimum, the traffic must be routed to the correct VirtualService based on the traffic's incoming DNS name. Services Kiali can access the Service Mesh components configuration and will report on configuration errors. While not required for functionality, all services should be labelled and ports should have a name and protocol defined to avoid Kiali reporting configuration errors. Internal traffic routing Destination rules for each service must exist for traffic to be routed to the pods. In the most basic example, all traffic is routed to all pods in a service. The destination rules typically use the version label on pods to route traffic accordingly. Pods Pods must have specific labels for Pilot to manage traffic routing and for Kiali to display the service mesh correctly. Pods must have metadata labels called app and version , which identify the microservice application and the version of the application code running in the pod. Example application Weaveworks has a sample microservice-based application called the Sock Shop that UKCloud has modified to run inside OSM v1. See the sample code on GitHub at https://github.com/UKCloud/sock-shop-service-mesh . With the release of OSM v2, Red Hat has documented how to install a sample application into OSM v2. You can find more details in the Red Hat Service Mesh documentation .

    "keywords": "DNS zone forwarding in OpenShift clusters Overview This article documents the ability to forward DNS zones within OpenShift deployments. Forwarding zones can assist in resolving services on private networks if you have existing private DNS resolvers configured within your wider UKCloud environment. This removes the need to individually add domains to a node's local host file and can aid consumption of private services from within OpenShift. Intended audience This article is best aimed at those with OpenShift deployments with connectivity to a private network as other networks commonly have open resolvers available. OpenShift cluster DNS architecture We deploy load balancer pairs as part of an OpenShift deployment, primarily to provide redundancy for inbound traffic but also to resolve DNS requests. One pair resolves the local zone within the cluster (performing internal hostname resolution) and forwards all undefined zones outbound to an upstream open internet resolver. Zones can be configured to be forwarded to a separate upstream server. All internet OpenShift nodes reference this load balancer pair. Where a deployment has connectivity with government community networks, another pair forwards the local zone and a small number of internet zones (required for provisioning and ongoing maintenance) to the previously mentioned load balancer pair, with all remaining zones being forwarded to upstream open resolvers on the secondary network. All secondary network nodes reference the secondary network load balancers as resolvers. Identifying forward zones A zone is a domain (for example domain.com) and configuring a forward zone will forward any DNS queries received for that domain and all sub-domains to the configured IP address. This allows different domains to be resolved by separate DNS servers at a granular level if required. In OpenShift deployments with connectivity to a private network, you may want to resolve a pre-existing internal zone using a private resolver, instead of forwarding these requests to an external service (and therefore routing traffic over an external network). This gives you the benefit of being able to locate private services that may otherwise be restricted or inaccessible from these networks. Examples of services that could be consumed from OpenShift include: container image registry, binary repository, version control system. Requesting DNS zone forwarding You can provide any zones that you want to forward DNS requests for (including the IPs of the corresponding DNS resolvers) in a Service Request. This can be as part of a deployment request or post-deployment, provided your environment has connectivity to a private network. We will test that queries are being replied to as expected and assist you in diagnosing issues.

Intended audience Administrators and operators of the UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift service. Lifecycle management Red Hat's official versioning for their OpenShift Container Platform is X.Y where X indicates the major version and Y indicates a minor version. Although Red Hat officially fully supports each major X version of the OpenShift Container Platform for five years, as a service provider, this duration is too long for UKCloud to ensure the highest levels of security, performance and features. As such, UKCloud will officially support the current (X.Y) and previous minor version (X.Y-1) . As minor versions are released roughly every six months, this provides the assurance that your environments will be fully supported by UKCloud for a minimum of twelve months. To illustrate this, the green shaded areas in the image below, show which versions UKCloud would support for different released versions. Upgrades of major X and minor Y versions Currently, UKCloud does not offer in-place upgrades between major versions. Customers can trigger minor version upgrades inside the cluster at any time, providing total flexibility to upgrade at a convenient time. We require customers to stay on UKCloud-supported versions, so ask that upgrades are done in a timely manner to stay on a Y-1 release. For more information on performing updates and what happens if customers aren't on Y-1, see Supported customer update strategy for version 4 clusters .

Within this cluster configuration we deploy Squid proxy to enable non-internet connected nodes to request internet resources and data in a restricted manner. Squid Squid proxy enables containers running on worker nodes (with government community network access) to request resources from the internet. Our default configuration only permits access to specific endpoints to ensure compliance with network regulatory requirements. You can find more information regarding these endpoints in How to permit outbound access to internet hosts in deployments with government community network connectivity . Purpose of no_proxy no_proxy is an environment variable used in conjunction with http_proxy and https_proxy . If an HTTP(S) connection attempt is destined for an address or hostname listed in no_proxy , the traffic will not be requested via the proxy and will instead use the routes on the current node, ensuring connectivity is not lost with community or private networks. Viewing proxy environment variables To view the required proxy environment variables for your OpenShift cluster, you can refer to the environment values set for the docker-registry Deployment Config in the default project with a breakdown of these variables following: $ oc describe dc docker-registry -n default | grep PROXY NO_PROXY: .cluster.local,.svc,10.2.1.13,10.2.1.19,10.2.1.5,169.254.169.254,172.30.0.1,console.local-domain,cor00005.cni.ukcloud.com,frn00006.cni.ukcloud.com,master-infra-0.local-domain,master-infra-1.local-domain,master-infra-2.local-domain,worker-infra-0.local-domain,worker-infra-1.local-domain,worker-tenant-s-0.local-domain,worker-tenant-s-1.local-domain HTTP_PROXY: http://10.2.1.10:3128 HTTPS_PROXY: http://10.2.1.10:3128 NO_PROXY : String containing hosts/addresses to be accessed without traversing the proxy HTTP_PROXY : Cluster Proxy URL for HTTP requests HTTPS_PROXY : Cluster Proxy URL for HTTPS requests When building container images within OpenShift, these environment variables will be passed through to the image pushed to your local registry. When working with images that have been imported from an external source, you may need to apply these environment values to ensure that you can access internet resources on the allow-list from your community network nodes. Identifying where you might need to add entries to no_proxy Typically you can identify where the proxy is denying requests by looking for keywords such as forbidden or when receiving HTTP 403 status code responses. Below you can see an example where an HTTPS request to registry.exampleurl.com has been blocked by the proxy. $ oc new-app centos/ruby-25-centos7~https://github.com/sclorg/ruby-ex.git W0412 13:52:16.288545 50288 dockerimagelookup.go:233] Docker registry lookup failed: Get https://registry.exampleurl.com: Forbidden error: unable to locate any images in image streams, local docker images with name \"centos/ruby-25-centos7\" In the example above this is an internet URL so it would be best to add this specific domain (or all subdomains using .exampleurl.com ) to the proxy-whitelist configmap in the whitelist project, as documented in How to permit outbound access to internet hosts in deployments with government community network connectivity . If this URL was accessible on another network other than the internet, this would be a good candidate to be added to no_proxy to ensure the proxy was bypassed. Adding entries to no_proxy Entries can be added to no_proxy pre-deployment if included in the Service Request requesting the environment. Otherwise if you identify additional endpoints that you would like to bypass the proxy post-deployment, you will need to raise a Support Request via the UKCloud Portal and arrange a suitable maintenance window as a restart of the master, node and Docker services are required. Examples of domains you may want to bypass the proxy could be: Private DNS Zone/CIDR Community Domain/CIDR When supplying no_proxy items, you can reference any of the following types: A specific IP CIDR domain.tld subdomain.domain.tld .domain.tld (includes domain and all subdomains) Further information https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install_config/http_proxies.html https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/dev_guide/environment_variables.html Feedback If you find an issue with this article, click Improve this Doc to suggest a change.

    "keywords": "Pricing information for UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift Overview UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift pricing can be as low as 83p per hour (using committed annual pricing option). Full pricing with all options, including licensing and connectivity, is available in the UKCloud Pricing Guide . OpenShift is packaged to provide you with a high level of flexibility to scale your environments inline with your workloads. Note The information in this article is applicable to OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) v4 or higher. For information about OCP 3.x, request the G-Cloud 11 UKCloud Pricing Guide. UKCloud deployed Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform This deployment option provides a full Red Hat OCP that has been deployed by UKCloud and is ready to consume without delay. We will deploy an OpenShift cluster that contain multiple nodes: control plane nodes, infrastructure nodes for infrastructure services and application nodes for application servers. The number of nodes within your cluster will dictate the monthly charge. Control plane and infrastructure nodes OpenShift requires a minimum of three control plane nodes to provide the control plane and we recommend a minimum of two infrastructure nodes to provide additional services such as ingress controllers, metrics, developer console and aggregated logging. Application nodes You'll need at least one application node to run your application and we recommend a minimum of two nodes for resilience. Application node pricing includes a Red Hat OpenShift subscription component. Pricing examples Example 1: Small deployment Example 2: Medium deployment Example 3: Hourly application node pricing Control plane: 3 x control plane nodes Infrastructure nodes: None Application nodes: 2 x m1.medium Persistent volume storage used: 60GiB Tier 2 persistent volume storage Control plane cost per month Monthly pricing for the control plane costs £412 per month. Infrastructure node cost per month There are no infrastructure nodes, so there is no infrastructure node cost. Note As there are no infrastructure nodes, aggregated logging is not available. Application node cost per month Monthly pricing for two m1.medium application nodes costs 2 x £200 per month = £400 . Storage cost per month Tier 2 persistent block storage costs £0.10 per GiB month, so the storage cost for 60GiB is £6.00 . Total basic cost Calculate the total basic cost by adding together the control plane, infrastructure and application node and storage costs. Control plane cost + Infrastructure cost + Application node cost + Storage cost = Total basic cost per month £412 + £0.00 + £400 + £6.00 = £818.00 Control plane: 3 x control plane nodes Infrastructure nodes: 2 x m1.medium Application nodes: 2 x m1.medium and 1 x r1.medium Persistent volume storage used: 60GiB Tier 2 persistent volume storage and 40GiB Tier 1 persistent storage Control plane cost per month Monthly pricing for the control plane costs £412 per month. Infrastructure node cost per month Monthly pricing for two m1.medium infrastructure nodes costs 2 x £115 per month = £230 . Application node cost per month Monthly pricing for two m1.medium application nodes cost 2 x £200 per month = £400 . Monthly pricing for one r1.medium application node costs £457 per month. The total cost of application nodes is £400 + £457 = £857 per month. Storage cost per month Tier 2 persistent block storage costs £0.10 per GiB month, so the storage cost for 60GiB is £6.00 . Tier 1 persistent block storage costs £0.25 per GiB month, so the storage cost for 40GiB is £10.00 . The total cost of storage is £6.00 + £10.00 = £16.00 per month. Total basic cost Calculate the total basic cost by adding together the control plane, infrastructure and application node and storage costs. Control plane cost + Infrastructure cost + Application node cost + Storage cost = Total basic cost per month £412 + £230 + £857 + £16.00 = £1,515.00 The following provides an example of hourly pricing using an r1.medium application node for burst workloads. Control plane: 3 x control plane nodes Infrastructure nodes: 2 x m1.medium Application nodes: 2 x m1.medium (monthly) and 1 x r1.medium (hourly) Persistent volume storage used: 60GiB Tier 2 persistent volume storage and 40GiB Tier 1 persistent storage Control plane node cost per month Monthly pricing for the control plane costs £412 per month. Infrastructure node cost per month Monthly pricing for two m1.medium infrastructure nodes costs 2 x £115 per month = £230 . Application node cost per month Monthly pricing for two m1.medium application nodes costs 2 x £200 per month = £400 . Hourly pricing for one r1.medium application node costs £0.65 per hour If the r1.medium application node is used for 200 hours to cover increased demand, the monthly cost works out at: Hours in operation x Application node cost = Application node cost per month 200 x £0.65 = £130 The total cost of application nodes is £400 + £130 = £530 per month. Storage cost per month Tier 2 persistent block storage costs £0.10 per GiB month, so the storage cost for 60GiB is £6.00 . Tier 1 persistent block storage costs £0.25 per GiB month, so the storage cost for 40GiB is £10.00 . The total cost of storage is £6.00 + £10.00 = £16.00 per month. Total basic cost Calculate the total basic cost by adding together the control plane, infrastructure and application node and storage costs. Control plane cost + Infrastructure cost + Application node cost + Storage cost = Total basic cost £412 + £230 + £530 + £16.00 = £1,188.00 Discount options The following discount and purchase schemes are available with UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift: Commitment discount - application node pricing is available at hourly, monthly or annual rates, with the relevant discounts built in Cloud Credits For more information about the discount and purchase schemes offered by UKCloud, see the UKCloud Pricing Guide . Additional pricing notes Additional networks By default, your OpenShift cluster will only be connected to the internet. Your OpenShift environment can be provisioned on other networks, such as HSCN, Janet, RLI or PSN, at a flat fee of £50 per month per network, plus the addtional network charges as defined within the UKCloud Pricing Guide . Registry storage UKCloud uses our Cloud Storage service for registry storage, which is charged at the prevailing rate. For more information, see the Cloud Storage Service Definition . Enhanced Aggregated Logging By default, an EFK (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana) stack is deployed onto infrastructure nodes to aggregate logs for a range of OpenShift Enterprise services. To provide this service, UKCloud will need to provision an initial allocation of Tier 2 persistent volume, charged at the prevailing rate, for the storage of logs. If you don't have any infrastructure nodes, aggregated logging is not available. Enhanced Metric Collection UKCloud will provision a Prometheus-based metrics platform to collect and publish your cluster's metrics from all containers and components in one user interface. This will run on infrastructure nodes if you have them, or application nodes otherwise. To provide this service, UKCloud will need to provision an initial allocation of Tier 2 persistent volume, charged at the prevailing rate, to store these metrics.

    "title": "Considerations when scaling an OpenShift cluster",
    "keywords": "Considerations when scaling an OpenShift cluster Infrastructure applications With your UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift cluster we deploy a number of infrastructure applications by default. These are quality of service features that are intended to help you with administration, management and application development within your cluster. Examples include the EFK stack, Hawkular Metrics, the integrated registry, the service catalog and, with v3.11 deployments onwards, Prometheus and Grafana. These applications run their components on the infrastructure nodes (these are the nodes with the naming convention worker-infra). Your cluster comes out of the box with three of these nodes and each has 16GB of memory and two vCPUs. This provides an adequate amount of resource and good level of resiliency for the infrastructure components to support a production deployment. If you're looking to scale out the cluster to a larger size and start running more intensive applications or builds, these nodes may not be enough. For example, the more applications and nodes you have in your environment, the more logs will be gathered off the nodes by fluentd and sent off to Elasticsearch for indexing. This will result in significantly higher resource usage. In the same vein, the more pods and nodes that are running in your environment, the more stats Hawkular Metrics will be gathering and storing in the Cassandra database. Recommendations Scaling of the infrastructure applications to make them more resilient is possible but may require additional infrastructure nodes to be deployed. For example to scale Elasticsearch to three nodes/containers we recommend having a minimum of four infrastructure nodes. To have these applications scaled up or down raise a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. Finally, you'll want to consider the storage usage of the infrastructure applications. As previously mentioned, the more applications and nodes you have in your environment the more logs will be gathered off the nodes by fluentd and sent off to Elasticsearch for indexing. This means the persistent volume used by Elasticsearch will have more data to store. By default, we provide 14 days retention and a 40GB persistent volume with Elasticsearch. If this volume fills to 100% then the EFK stack will not work until indices are deleted or more space is provided. If you're relying on the EFK stack for your logs then you'll want to determine an average of how much storage your cluster is consuming on logs per day and request an increase of the persistent volume to fit your desired retention. Planning your scale out You'll want to estimate how many pods you are expecting to fit on a node. Things to take into account are the CPU, memory and storage (if your pod is going to be writing to the local file system rather than persistent storage) requirements of your applications. This will give you an idea of the size and amount of nodes you'll need. For more information regarding planning for application requirements, see the following OpenShift documentation page: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/scaling_performance/cluster_limits.html#scaling-performance-planning-your-environment-according-to-application-requirements Scaling If you'd like to scale up your cluster, raise a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal and provide us with the size, network connectivity and quantity of nodes you'd like to add. The same process should be followed to scale a cluster down, this time providing the details of the node(s) you want to remove. Note The network connectivity you request for the scaled up nodes must be present in the cluster. Note OpenShift v4 clusters support self-service scaling. You can find out more information in How to scale an OpenShift v4 cluster .

    "title": "Security best practices for UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift",
    "keywords": "Security best practices for UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift Overview As is the nature of technology, any cloud-based service is vulnerable to exploits from both hackers and insiders just the same as traditional environments. Such risks include data stealing, crypto-mining, ransomware and service disruption to name a few. Although the nature of running container-based workloads reduces the threat to your underlying infrastructure, that threat is not completely eliminated and you should still take care when designing, developing and deploying your container-based workloads to minimise the risks to those deployments in UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift. This article sets out some best practices to follow to minimise the attack vector to a UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift cluster and its workloads. Intended audience This article is intended for anyone who is using UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift. It highlights some of the best practices to keep OpenShift workloads secure. Role Based Access Control Within OpenShift, you can grant various levels of access to users, which can be cluster-wide or limited to a particular OpenShift object. You can associate users and groups with multiple roles at the same time. You can view a pre-defined list of cluster roles and local roles here . Users with the cluster-admin default cluster role bound cluster-wide can perform any action on any resource. Users with the admin default cluster role bound locally can manage roles and bindings within a project. It is good practice to follow the principle of least privilege with OpenShift access. For information about managing access to OpenShift, see How to manage OpenShift access in the UKCloud Portal . This article also explains how to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) when logging in to OpenShift. Users are also encouraged to change their passwords regularly, which is possible to do from the UKCloud Portal. You should ensure that OpenShift account credentials are not shared between multiple users. Instead, you should create individual user accounts for each user with the correct role binding. It is also the responsibility of each individual user to ensure the physical security of the terminal from which they access OpenShift. You should also apply the principle of least privilege to your containers' workloads. This means you should run your workloads as a user with just enough permissions to run the workload within your containers, particularly avoiding running privileged containers if this can be avoided. If however a workload does require to be run as a privileged container, then you should ensure that you set the correct security context constraint (SCC) to run that container. You can read more about setting the correct SCC here . Containers that try to run as privileged without the relevant SCC set will fail to run. Service accounts You should use service accounts for all API access, which should be accomplished by an automated process; never use a regular user's credentials. Usually a service account's username is the same as the project it is created for, followed by its name: system:serviceaccount:<project>:<name> For example: system:serviceaccount:continuous-integration:jenkins You can read more about service accounts here . Creating and deploying secure container images Just like traditional software packages, containers also run software, even if they are running that software within a self contained environment of a container. These containers can be built and run using vulnerable software packages/libraries. It is therefore considered good practice to do the following to ensure that you are not introducing vulnerable containers into your clusters: Only use base images from trusted sources, such as Red Hat's container registry, that are scanned for vulnerabilities and given a security rating. Docker Hub also provides some certified containers that are built using best practices, tested and validated against the Docker Enterprise Edition platform and APIs, pass Docker's security requirements, and are collaboratively supported by Docker and the company responsible for the container. You can also build base containers from scratch using only the software packages you need for your workload. However, building containers from scratch and using just enough of the software packages you need to run for your workload does not guarantee that your base image is going to be free of all possible vulnerabilities as it is possible that some of those software packages could contain vulnerabilities. Scan your containers with container vulnerability scanning software as part of your build or deployment process. There are numerous tools available to scan containers. These tools give you a security rating on your final container once it's been created from a secure base container. There are a number of tools available to do this, the following is a small sample we're aware of: Black Duck Hub JFrog Xray Twistlock Image-inspector Clair Secrets Sensitive information, such as passwords, SSH keys, tokens and certificates, are examples of information that could be considered secret. As such secrets should never be stored in any place in plain text readable format (for example, in source code, GitHub repositories, and so on). It is imperative that when secrets are required in OpenShift, they are set up as OpenShift Secrets. This allows the secrets to be encrypted within OpenShift and accessed only by the relevant containers when they are needed. However there are limits to the current OpenShift secrets ability: the secrets are encoded in base64, which can be easily decoded into plain text, and stored secrets can be accessible from any container on the same node. You could use a popular solution like Hashicorp Vault for secret storage. Limiting resources You should always set up containers with resource limits. In the event of a denial of service attack, or even just a burst of very high load on a service, these resource limits will prevent pods from using all available resources in the node they are running on. You can read more about setting resource quotas and limits here . Route security Within OpenShift, you can expose your services using routes. Creating a route to a service enables your users to access the service through a URL in a browser. If you do not specify any SSL certificates for your route than it would be exposed on HTTP port 80 without any SSL certificate. You can secure these routes with SSL encryption using one of three SSL termination methods: Edge - SSL termination is done on the HAProxy router from which point onwards the traffic is un-encrypted Passthrough termination - There is no SSL decryption on the routers; instead connections are passed straight through the routers to the OpenShift applications, which are then responsible for SSL certificate termination and traffic decryption. Re-Encrypt - This process uses two certificates: the first certificate is held on the HAProxy router and the second in the pods. This secures traffic all the way down to the application. Control plane and data plane lockdown As part of the UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift service we offer the ability to lock down the control plane and/or data planes to your cluster to specific IP addresses or subnets. This helps to protect each of these if you know the acceptable sources for all traffic (for example only allowing control plane access from an office network or VPN). This is done with the use of security groups at the cloud platform layer outside OpenShift. You can apply these restrictions at the time of cluster deployment or later by raising a Service Request to the UKCloud OpenShift Support team via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. The information we require to apply these rules is: the plane you would like these applied to, for example, control plane or data plane (specify internet or community network if applicable) and the source addresses or ranges that will be allowed access. When services are protected by these controls, any non-matched traffic is dropped before it reaches OpenShift. Whitelisting At the OpenShift cluster level, you can secure your routes by applying an allow-list by IP address. The advantage of doing this is that you can do this yourself, however this does allow traffic to reach the OpenShift route before it is either allowed through or dropped based on the list of allowed addresses you have applied. We have documented the process of restricting access per route here . Network Isolation OpenShift uses software-defined networking (SDN) to provide cluster-wide networking that enables communication between pods across the OpenShift cluster. This Container Networking Interface (CNI) runs in the OpenShift SDN project and creates an overlay network using the Open vSwitch (OVS) SDN plugin. OVS has three different plugins based on the type of pod network cluster admins would like to create. Previously we were using the ovs-multitenant SDN plugin but, as of February 2019 and OpenShift 3.11, we have been deploying OpenShift clusters using the ovs-network-policy SDN plugin. This plugin allows project administrators to configure their own network isolation policies using NetworkPolicy objects . We have documented the process of using Network Policy based isolation here .

    "keywords": "Making the most of your UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift trial Overview Welcome to your UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift trial. Your trial OpenShift cluster is a secure, single-tenant private deployment on UKCloud's Assured OpenStack cloud. During an OpenShift trial, the OpenShift cluster is typically only connected to the internet, however connectivity to many other government community networks is available in OpenShift clusters after the trial phase. The purpose of an OpenShift trial is for you to get hands-on experience with Red Hat™ OpenShift container orchestration technology to see if it is the correct technology for you. Intended audience This article is intended for developers who have signed up for an OpenShift trial with UKCloud. Developers are expected to have a good understanding of containerisation and container orchestration technologies to maximise their benefit from an OpenShift trial. Introduction to UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift trials OpenShift provides a platform-as-a-service, which means that you don't need to worry about the underlying hardware or operating system. Instead, you can focus on developing, deploying, scaling and monitoring your applications in OpenShift, maximising your return on investment in terms of money and time. With UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift, you have administrator access to your cluster, giving you the control you need to create, deploy and administer your environment as you see fit. All OpenShift deployments get a Foundation Pack, which includes the management and orchestration planes. These are essentially three control plane nodes, three infrastructure nodes and load balancers for the control and data planes. During a trial, each cluster is also provisioned with two small Runtime Packs. These are essentially two OpenStack VMs running RedHat Atomic OS with 16GB RAM, two vCPUs and 100GB disks each. This is also the minimum number of Runtime Packs UKCloud recommends in each OpenShift deployment in order to provide minimal resilience and enable interruption free patching. After the trial phase it is possible to deploy larger and more nodes for your cluster. OpenShift documentation: OpenShift Container Platform architecture GUI and CLI Access To access the OpenShift cluster GUI, you need an internet-enabled device running an HTML5-capable browser. You will also be set up for access to the UKCloud Portal and given the relevant access to your OpenShift deployment. OpenShift documentation: About the Developer perspective in the web console In addition to GUI access, you can also access OpenShift through the CLI. To do this, you need to install the oc client on your machines. To avoid any compatibility issues please install the same version of the oc client as your OpenShift cluster. OpenShift documentation: Getting started with the CLI Storage Each trial deployment has a block storage quota of 2TB across either Tier 1 or Tier 2 storage. This is enforced at the OpenStack project layer. This storage is available to the projects you create within OpenShift and you can consume the storage by creating Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) for your applications. PVCs are used for pods that run stateful applications; data inside pods that is not stored on PVCs will be lost when the pods are restarted, for example when the application is redeployed, updated or as a result of node evacuations during patching. You can increase your storage quotas by creating a Service Request in the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. Where possible, deploy application pods statelessly. Stateless application pods scale more easily and hence tend to be more resilient and performant. OpenShift is deployed with an internal image registry making use of UKCloud's object storage service for persistence. This includes 60GB of free storage capacity, which does not consume your 2TB block storage quota; rather this is in addition to the 2TB data limit. UKCloud provisions an Elasticsearch, Fluentd and Kibana stack, which uses 200GB of Tier 2 storage (which does consume some of the 2TB storage limit). Image Security You should take care when creating your container images to ensure the images do not run as root. You should set up containers to run as a user who has just enough rights to run the container workload.

Master nodes Master nodes provide the foundation OpenShift services to support the orchestration and management of the container runtime environments. An operational OpenShift cluster requires a minimum of three control plane nodes for API, scheduling and etcd key-value store. Infrastructure nodes Infrastructure nodes provide supporting services such as OpenShift routers, registry, metric collection and aggregated logging. Infrastructure nodes are not mandatory, but we recommend a minimum of two infrastructure nodes to provide integrated cluster services. Application nodes Application nodes provide the compute resources to host your containerised applications and services. We strongly recommend the initial deployment of two or more application nodes for production environments to provide resilience to your workloads in the event of the failure of a single node. Storage options Containers in OpenShift by default don't persist data. Every time an application is started, it creates a new container with an immutable image. Hence, any persisted data in the file systems is lost when the container stops or is destroyed. Use persistent volumes within your OpenShift environment to provide data persistence independent of containers. You can purchase persistent volumes for your cluster as stated below: Tier 1 Persistent Volume Tier 2 Persistent Volume Overview Provides our most performant block storage for workloads requiring consistently higher disk throughput Block storage with typical performance characteristics for use by production applications or storage Number of file copies 3 3 Use cases Web caching Containerised analytics Highly performant, real-time web/mobile applications Standard, containerised web/mobile applications Storing OpenShift logs and metrics Note In line with current restrictions on the OpenStack service underpinning OpenShift, you can make/attach 25 additional persistent volume claims (PVCs) to each worker node. Optional extras To complement your UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift service, UKCloud offers the following value-added options. Note Some of these extras will carry supplementary charges; please see the UKCloud Pricing Guide for full details. Additional networks By default, your OpenShift cluster will only be connected to the internet. Your OpenShift environment can be provisioned on other networks such as PSN, HSCN, Janet and RLI at a flat fee per month per network plus the additional network charges. For more information, see the UKCloud Pricing Guide . Registry storage A benefit of OpenShift is its ability to build Docker images directly from your source code, deploy them, and manage their lifecycle. To enable this, OpenShift utilises an integrated Docker registry to locally manage images. This registry is stored securely, using our Cloud Storage service, outside of your OpenShift environment to help ensure the resilience and availability of your images. Standard Cloud Storage rates apply, for more information, see the UKCloud Pricing Guide . Enhanced aggregated logging By default, an EFK (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana) stack is deployed onto infrastructure nodes to aggregate logs for a range of OpenShift Enterprise services. Application developers can view the logs of the projects for which they have view access. The EFK stack aggregates logs from hosts and applications, whether coming from multiple containers or even deleted pods. To provide this service, UKCloud will need to provision an initial allocation of Tier 2 persistent volume, charged at the prevailing rate, for the storage of logs. As your workloads increase or become more critical and you want to increase the performance and resilience of your Elasticsearch cluster by scaling it across three nodes, you can deploy an additional infrastructure node. Enhanced metric collection UKCloud will provision a Prometheus-based metrics platform to collect and publish your cluster's metrics from all containers and components in one user interface. This will run on infrastructure nodes, if you have them, or application nodes otherwise. To provide this service, UKCloud will need to provision an initial allocation of Tier 2 persistent volume, charged at the prevailing rate, to store this data. To provide resilience and added performance to your cluster's metrics, you can deploy additional infrastructure nodes. SSL certificates By default, UKCloud will provide 90-day Let's Encrypt SSL certificates for your OpenShift cluster. At the point of deployment, you can provide your own certificates for use with OpenShift. Container native storage To facilitate the deployment of stateful workloads, UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift offers dynamically provisioned persistent storage. It is vital that any persistent workloads utilise the appropriate storage policy for the workload to ensure no data loss when a container restarts. The customer is responsible for backup and disaster recovery of any data stored in persistent volumes. Backup/recovery and disaster recovery As standard, localised component failures are tolerated within the infrastructure through elimination of single points of failure (including physical server failure or disk failure). Although OpenShift is designed to deploy and manage stateless applications (applications that can be destroyed and re-instantiated without risk of data loss), you should maintain an original copy or backup copy of any persistent or dynamic data hosted on this service (such as MySQL DB) by using, for example, UKCloud's Cloud Storage service. Service limitations Scalability As a true cloud platform, UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift provides full elasticity and scalability. However, to protect the integrity of the platform and manage customer spend, soft limits on the number and size of application instances will be in place. These limits may be extended on request. Persistent volumes In line with current restrictions on the OpenStack service that underpins OpenShift, you can claim/attach 25 additional persistent volume claims (PVCs) to each worker node. Published features not currently available The following features published in the UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift Service Definition are not currently available: Janet, PSN and RLI connectivity Although these features are not currently available, they will be considered on request.

    "title": "UKCloud for OpenStack FAQs",
    "keywords": "UKCloud for OpenStack FAQs Service What is the service? UKCloud for OpenStack is an OpenStack-powered Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering which enables organisations to rapidly provision and scale secure instances (VMs) in seconds, in a flexible and autonomous manner. UKCloud provides this service across two security domains, Assured OFFICIAL (formerly PGA IL2) and Elevated OFFICIAL (formerly PGA IL3), offering up to 99.95% availability. This choice allows customers to precisely match application and user needs to an appropriate security domain and cost, instead of designing to the highest level which may not always be needed. What hypervisor do you use? UKCloud for OpenStack is built using KVM hypervisor technology, a trusted solution for implementing virtualised environments. Which disk formats does UKCloud for OpenStack support? The disk format of a virtual machine image is the format of the underlying disk image. Virtual appliance vendors have different formats for laying out the information contained in a virtual machine disk image. Set the disk format for your image to one of the following values: aki - An Amazon kernel image ami - An Amazon machine image ari - An Amazon ramdisk image iso - An archive format for the data contents of an optical disc, such as CD-ROM qcow2 - Supported by the QEMU emulator that can expand dynamically and supports Copy on Write raw - An unstructured disk image format; if you have a file without an extension it is possibly a raw format vdi - Supported by VirtualBox virtual machine monitor and the QEMU emulator vhd - The VHD disk format, a common disk format used by virtual machine monitors from VMware, Xen, Microsoft, VirtualBox, and others vmdk - Common disk format supported by many common virtual machine monitors Instances (VMs) Can instances have different service levels? UKCloud for OpenStack is a cloud platform built specifically for cloud native applications which have been engineered to use stateless, disposable instances. Due to the disposable design constructs of customer solutions, only a single service level is required Are instances contended? Instances are contended using the default OpenStack ratios against the following resources: CPU - 16:1 Memory - 1.1:1 Do I get root access to the instances I deploy? Yes, as this is a true IaaS cloud service, you have complete control and autonomy over each instance you deploy, and so have full 'root' or administrative access. What instance sizes are available? UKCloud offers a variety of predefined flavours to meet customers' needs. The smallest configuration is 512MiB memory and 1 vCPU. The largest is 440GiB memory with 56 vCPU. Check the Service Definition for more details on the currently available sizes. Does UKCloud offer dedicated, bare-metal host capabilities (OpenStack Ironic) with UKCloud for OpenStack? UKCloud currently does not offer dedicated, bare metal host capabilities with its UKCloud for OpenStack service. We do however provide large instances, with up to 56 vCPUs and 440GiB RAM, with no overcommit. UKCloud also offers its Private Compute service, which provides dedicated compute capabilities for use with OpenStack; please visit the UKCloud Knowledge Centre or contact your Account Director for further details. Can I resize an instance? Yes, you can change instance size (processor, memory and storage allocations) to a different predefined size via the self-service Portal and API. Increasing instance size may result in the instance being billed at a higher rate. Additional volume storage can be allocated instantly and will be billed on a per GiB basis. The instance will be rebooted as part of the resize operation. What is the speed of each vCPU? This is set at 2.4 GHz across instances. Does UKCloud for OpenStack offer GPU optimised instances? Currently UKCloud does not offer GPU optimised OpenStack instances. Does UKCloud offer compute encryption on instances? Not by default but, if it's required, you can implement it using a technology of your choice inside the instance OS. Data at Rest Encryption (D@RE) is available on persistent volumes, see the Storage section of this article for further details. Networking How many IP addresses do I get? You're initially allocated three external IP addresses with each OpenStack project. You can ask for more external IP addresses via a Service Request in the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. How many network routers do I get? You're initially able to create up to two network routers in each OpenStack project. You can ask the router quota to be increased via a Service Request in the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. How many PSN IP addresses do I get? Customer organisations are initially allocated one external PSN IP address. Additional external PSN IP addresses can be requested via a Service Request should a valid business requirement arise. What firewall services are available? UKCloud controls and manages a perimeter firewall on the edge of our Assured cloud platform which securely segregates traffic. OpenStack includes the concept of \"Security Groups\" which can be used to implement firewall filtering on the virtual NIC level. You can also use your preferred software firewall and security appliances deployed within your project. Which firewall ports do you suggest to open? To access the infrastructure via the dashboard and API you will need access through any firewalls on the following ports to the OpenStack endpoints you target. 443, 13000, 13004, 13005, 13041, 13292, 13774, 13776, 13778, 13786, 13876, 13977 Do you offer dynamic or static IP addresses? The external IP addresses are allocated to the project from a pool and will remain allocated to that project unless you explicitly select to \"release\" the address. Internal IPs are assigned to instances from a pool and will remain assigned to that instance/network port until that instance or network port is deleted. Optionally, it is possible to select the IP address assigned during instance/port creation. Are external Domain Name System (DNS) services available? No, we don't currently offer this service. You can implement your own DNS servers within your solution, or configure your instances to connect to an externally hosted DNS server - for example, one hosted on a government secure network such as PSN or HSCN; or one available on the Internet such as Google 8.8.8.8. Are domain name registration services available? No, we don't currently offer this service. Some government secure networks (such as PSN and HSCN) offer domain name registration and DNS hosting as part of their service. For internet-facing services a third-party domain provider will be required. Is Network Time Protocol available for time synchronisation? Network Time Protocol services will initially only be available via public NTP servers. You can find a list of public NTP servers operated by NIST here . Can UKCloud provide SSL certificates or can existing SSL certificates be used? UKCloud doesn't provide SSL certificates, but you can use your existing ones. Some government secure networks (such as PSN and HSCN) provide SSL certificates as part of their service. Do you offer Load Balancing as a Service (LBaaS)? The answer to this depends on which of UKCloud's OpenStack platforms you are using: Region OpenStack version LBaaS supported? COR00005 OpenStack Platform 10 (Newton Release) No, as OpenStack Neutron does not support highly-available load balancing services. COR00005-2 FRN00006 OpenStack Platform 13 (Queens Release) In Beta* - Uses the OpenStack Octavia project. *Beta allows early access to new features for testing and feedback purposes. Although UKCloud has performed testing in production, we cannot warrant for the use within a customer's production environment. Can I deploy my own load balancer? Yes, you can deploy your own load balancing virtual appliance provided it is compatible with KVM hypervisor and OpenStack. Do you have an IPSEC VPN connection for uploading sensitive data? We currently do not offer any VPN/Tunnelling as a Service from within the UKCloud for OpenStack product. Customers can create their own VPN endpoints by deploying a software appliance such as pfSense on an instance within their project. Can I create a network to connect two separate OpenStack projects? You can have a network between two separate OpenStack projects, however the implementation will vary based on whether the OpenStack projects are within the same UKCloud region. Within the same region - UKCloud can create a network on your behalf, but you need to be aware of and agree to the following caveats: This will allow any instance in both projects to speak to each other without any restriction. This is due to the way the default security group is defined. As this is non-standard, we would request that you test this solution thoroughly before relying upon it in production. Across two separate regions - UKCloud will create and configure a VRF on your behalf, which you can then use to route traffic between OpenStack projects. To request the implementation of either the options shown above, raise a ticket within the My Calls section of the Portal. Alternatively, you can contact support by phone or email. Storage How much storage do I get with an instance? The default amount of storage which comes with each instance starts from 10GiB of ephemeral storage and increases as larger instances are consumed. Full details can be found in the UKCloud for OpenStack Service Definition . All ephemeral storage is fixed and cannot be increased. How do I scale beyond the default allocation of ephemeral storage? UKCloud for OpenStack is available with persistent block storage options. Persistent block storage is resilient, distributed block storage that can be moved between instances and retain data in the event of an instance becoming destroyed or unavailable. You can quickly and easily allocate additional persistent block storage volumes via the self-service dashboard or API, which will be charged on a per-GiB basis. Can I reallocate storage across instances? You can detach persistent block storage volumes from one instance then attach them to another (except those being used as OS boot volumes). You cannot attach a volume to multiple instances simultaneously. You can allocate additional persistent block storage via the self-service dashboard or API, which will be charged on a per-GiB basis. Is instance storage persistent? No, the ephemeral storage provided with each instance is non-persistent and any data stored on it will be deleted at the point an instance is terminated. Persistent block storage volumes are persistent. If required, it is possible to deploy an instance using a block storage volume as its boot volume. Are there any known limitations to block storage volumes? Due to a current constraint within the OpenStack project, a maximum total of 25 block storage volumes (Tier 1 or Tier 2) can be attached to each OpenStack instance. Does UKCloud offer encryption on volumes? The answer to this depends on which of UKCloud's OpenStack services you are using: Region OpenStack version Encrypted volumes supported? COR00005 OpenStack Platform 10 (Newton Release) No, as Red Hat's Newton release does not support native Key Management as a Service (KMaaS) to underpin encryption COR00005-2 FRN00006 OpenStack Platform 13 (Queens Release) In Beta* *Beta allows early access to new features for testing and feedback purposes. Although UKCloud has performed testing in production, we cannot warrant for the use within a customer's production environment. What type of volume encryption is offered? UKCloud offers OpenStack's native Data at Rest Encryption (D@RE) as an option on OpenStack persistent volumes (Tier 1 / Tier 2 Volumes). D@RE is underpinned by OpenStack's native Key Management as a Service (KMaaS), Barbican. What type of encryption on persistent volumes is offered? AES256 encryption is delivered as part of OpenStack's native Data at Rest Encryption. Can I manage the keys used to encrypt persistent volumes? No, all key management for UKCloud's native Data at Rest Encryption on persistent volumes is managed by the backend Barbican service. Can I encrypt my ephemeral storage? UKCloud does not natively support the encryption of ephemeral storage. Can I use my own key management or Hardware Security Module (HSM) solution with Data at Rest Encryption? UKCloud does not currently support any third-party key management services or HSMs as part of its native Data at Rest Encryption on persistent volumes. Is object storage (OpenStack Swift) available? The OpenStack object storage service (Swift) is not currently available on UKCloud for OpenStack. However, UKCloud offers Cloud Storage, a separate S3-compatible object storage service that you can use in conjunction with OpenStack; see the Cloud Storage Service Definition for further details. What is the fastest way of importing large amounts of data onto the UKCloud platform? The speed of data transfer to the UKCloud platform isn't guaranteed. However, during tests of the upload and download speeds, an average of 8 Mbit/s was achieved for image import/export and 40 Mbit/s for data transferred over FTPS. For a transfer time calculator, click here . If you use FTPS to upload data to or download it from your environment, you can transfer up to 1TiB of data in a day. Management How do I access my solutions via the internet? You can access your instances using: The remote console via the OpenStack dashboard Remote access protocols (such as RDP/SSH) over a VPN or secure network How do I access my solutions via government networks (PSN, HSCN)? Although UKCloud allows you to make your customer-facing applications accessible via government network connections, the management of your Assured OFFICIAL OpenStack environment can only be achieved directly via an internet connection. OpenStack environments in our Elevated OFFICIAL security domain can be managed via the PSN network. Does OpenStack offer Key Management as a Service (KMaaS)? The answer to this depends on which of UKCloud's OpenStack platforms you are using: Region OpenStack version KMaaS supported? COR00005 OpenStack Platform 10 (Newton Release) No, customers will need to deploy their own Key Management solution. COR00005-2 FRN00006 OpenStack Platform 13 (Queens Release) Yes, using OpenStack's Barbican service. You can find further information here . What reports can I get about instances performance? UKCloud does not currently provide instance performance reports, but you can monitor their performance using standard tools within the operating system. Does UKCloud patch instances? No, you are responsible for the patching of your services. We make a patch repository available to you for instances on the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform (which cannot connect to the internet) for common operating systems that we provide. <!--### How do I find the latest patches to the UKCloud infrastructure? UKCloud maintains a Knowledge Centre article advising the current patch level of the UKCloud infrastructure. See [here](../other/other-ref-platform-patches.md). --> How do I access support and patches for operating systems that UKCloud licenses? UKCloud provides a repository of patches for common operating systems for customers to access and update from. Please refer to the onboarding guide or the Knowledge Centre for details. For support, you'll need to log a request with UKCloud, who will log the ticket with the relevant supplier. UKCloud will then inform you about any updates. However, UKCloud isn't responsible for the actual resolution of non-IaaS issues. How do I control an instance? You control an instance via the OpenStack dashboard or API. Controls include stop, start, restart, load media, clone, snapshot, and so on. Do you monitor instances? UKCloud monitors the underlying platform but doesn't monitor your OSs or applications. You can implement your own application performance monitoring solutions within your projects. Do you offer autoscaling? OpenStack offers built in autoscaling capabilities using the features of HEAT templates and Ceilometer event monitoring. For further details on autoscaling within OpenStack, see Auto Scaling for UKCloud for OpenStack . How quickly can I scale my service up or down? Horizontal scale can be achieved quickly by adding additional instances (usually in seconds). Vertical scaling is not recommended for cloud native applications, but can be achieved by resizing an instance to an alternative flavour type (where supported by the guest OS). Licensing, software and anti-virus What operating systems are available? UKCloud for OpenStack is powered by OpenStack, so is compatible with a wide range of x86/x64 operating systems. You can use the UKCloud catalogue of operating systems or upload your own: For Linux we offer; Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, Ubuntu 14.04 to 16.04 and CentOS 6.0 to 7.2. Windows 2012 R2 & Windows 2016 are fully supported Can I run Microsoft SQL on my instances? Microsoft SQL can be installed within an OpenStack instance. You have the choice to either bring your own license using the Microsoft License Mobility scheme or choose to use a UKCloud provided license. The process for both options are available on the UKCloud Knowledge Centre here . How can I license an operating system? Microsoft Microsoft terms and conditions preclude customers from using their own licence agreements for Windows Server in the Cloud. That means all licensing for Windows Server operating systems must be provided by UKCloud. Microsoft offers License Mobility, a scheme that allows a customer to provide additional software such as Exchange, SQL and so on, as long as the customer has appropriate Microsoft licensing as per the licence terms, conditions and usage rights. Do you have a Key Management System (KMS) for activating Windows? Yes. A we provide a step-by-step guide on configuring and using this service. How does RHEL licensing work? You can license RHEL operating systems yourself directly with Red Hat. We are currently unable to provide RHEL licences for UKCloud for OpenStack. Customers are responsible for ensuring correct licensing for any other operating system they chose to install. How up to date are the operating system images and mirrors? All CentOS, Ubuntu, Red Hat and Debian distributions are automatically updated to contain the latest patches and releases. For a list of supported operating systems, and instructions on how to access these repositories, see the appropriate article in the Knowledge Centre. What anti-virus do you offer on this service? Customers are advised to install their own anti-virus (AV) software, as UKCloud doesn't provide any. What applications are available as part of the default service? UKCloud does not offer any additional software other than what's included in the UKCloud Portal catalogue. Any additional software, including its licensing, is your responsibility. What is Bring Your Own (BYO) licensing for Red Hat? BYO licensing for Red Hat allows customers to select instances running on the UKCloud Assured cloud platform for covering by their own commercial agreement with Red Hat. UKCloud will remove the cost of the Red Hat licence from your monthly bill for the selected instances. You need to raise a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal to let us know which instances you will cover with your own Red Hat licence. Support How does UKCloud provide urgent maintenance notifications and incident reports? Current Service Status reports are published on the Status Page . You can view past incident reports on the UKCloud Portal. How do I raise a support ticket? The secure online UKCloud Portal provides most common service management functionality. You can raise tickets within the My Calls section of the Portal. Alternatively, you can contact support by phone or email. How do I manage my services? Services on the Assured OFFICIAL platform can be managed over the internet (or other connectivity) via the UKCloud Portal. For the Elevated OFFICIAL platform, security requirements are stricter and require either a PSN-approved connection, UKCloud Secure Remote Access or a self-managed CPA-approved VPN solution (for example site-to-site VPN). What are your service maintenance windows? See Understanding UKCloud service maintenance windows . Can UKCloud provide notifications for service status and maintenance? Yes, you can subscribe to the UKCloud Service Status page to be alerted to service status and maintenance notifications. Notifications can be via email, text, webhook or Atom/RSS feed. For more information, see How to subscribe to service status notifications . Service Limitations Are there any restrictions on the number of instances I can create or manipulate in a single request? Although designed to be a large-scale cloud platform, we strongly advise that when performing operations/requests against UKCloud for OpenStack you perform these actions in batches of no more than 30 (for example, only creating batches of up to 30 new instances in a single request). Additional requests can then be made to the platform for subsequent batches. How can I create additional OpenStack projects? Unfortunately, we are currently unable to offer customers of UKCloud for OpenStack the ability to directly create their own additional OpenStack projects. Additional projects are allowed, however these need to be created by UKCloud via a Service Request from within the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. How can I create additional OpenStack users? Unfortunately, we are currently unable to offer customers of UKCloud for OpenStack the ability to directly create their own additional OpenStack users. Additional users are allowed, however these need to be created by UKCloud via a Service Request from within the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. Onboarding How can I get started with the service? Within four hours of accepting your order, we'll create your primary administrator account, and send you a Welcome Pack, which includes the URL for the UKCloud Portal and associated authentication details. Your administrator can then create additional accounts for users within the project. Each user can then log on and begin using the service (depending on the security domain and connectivity). At the time of order, you can specify which of our two UK data centres you'd like to be deployed into. Meeting your request is at UKCloud's discretion. Is there a free trial? We offer a 30-day free trial so that you can test and evaluate our service without commitment. Your trial provides you with a live environment on the UKCloud platform to test our services and check whether they're suited to your needs. Before your trial, a Cloud Architect will engage with you to identify the goals you're working towards, to help ensure that your trial meets those goals. Throughout the trial period, a Service Delivery Manager (SDM) will provide support for any issues you may encounter or questions you may have. At the end of your free trial, you can seamlessly move to a billed service, leveraging any of the work you've already completed in the live trial environment. Backup Does UKCloud back up my projects or instances? UKCloud for OpenStack is a cloud platform built specifically for cloud native applications which have been engineered to use stateless, disposable instances. For customers looking to add a layer of data protection within their environments, UKCloud offers the following: Snapshots - You can create snapshots of your instances via the OpenStack dashboard or programmatically via the API. These snapshots, when used in conjunction with deployment orchestration tools or infrastructure as code templates such as HEAT, allow for environments to be rapidly replicated, redeployed or scaled. Self-service backup and recovery (Available November 2019) - UKCloud has partnered with Trilio to deliver a fully OpenStack-integrated, self-service backup and restoration capability that you can drive from within the Horizon dashboard or via the OpenStack API. Can I create scheduled snapshots? Snapshots cannot currently be scheduled directly through OpenStack, however custom scripts can be created and are available on the internet to enable snapshots to be programmatically set. How quickly can a snapshot be restored? Snapshots recovery is full self-service and can be invoked by customers at any time via the OpenStack dashboard or API. What is the Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of the snapshots? The RPO is totally within the customers control. For example, you could programmatically schedule a snapshot to run every hour or even every minute, at which point their RPO would match the frequency of your snapshots. We don't set a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) on snapshot recovery, but this is a fully self-service function available to the customer via the dashboard or API, with restoration times never exceeding two minutes (this will depend on the size of instance being recovered). Where are snapshots stored? By default, all snapshots are stored to our persistent block storage to provide data resilience. How much does UKCloud charge for snapshots? The functionality of snapshots is delivered free of charge to customers as part of the OpenStack service. The only charge for snapshots is for the persistent block storage your snapshots consume, which is charged by the GiB. How can I use the TrilioVault self-service backup and restoration service? See How to use TrilioVault self-service backup and restoration within OpenStack for further details. Does UKCloud charge for the TrilioVault self-service backup and restoration service? UKCloud charges a nominal monthly fee per instance being protected by this service. UKCloud charges by the whole month for any part month consumption of this service. You can find pricing details in the OpenStack section of the UKCloud Pricing Guide . Can I use my own backup software? Yes, you simply install appropriate backup software within your project and specify the backup location. A typical scenario would involve using a commercial backup solution (such as Symantec NetBackup, CommVault or EMC NetWorker) that points to a cloud storage service such as our Cloud Storage. Billing and legal What is the smallest unit of time I will be billed for? The minimum unit of time for use is one hour. Part hours will be rounded up. Will I be charged for instances in a 'Shut Off' state? You can shelve an instance, at which stage all compute charges for the instance will cease and you are only charged at the prevailing rate for the storage the instance was consuming. For all other states, UKCloud will continue to charge for any resources that exist within your OpenStack project. What are the charges to transfer data between projects within the same data centre? None. Data transfer between projects in this scenario is free. How can I view billing information? Real-time billing information is currently not available as a service provided by UKCloud, however customers are able to query the OpenStack Ceilometer API to query live event data. Historic billing information is available via the UKCloud Portal. How can I pay for the services? Payment for UKCloud services can be made by direct bank transfer (BACS/CHAPS). You can find bank details for payment on your invoice. How are snapshots charged? You will only ever be charged for the amount of Tier 1 or Tier 2 storage your snapshots consume, that you have scheduled via the OpenStack dashboard or the API - we do not place any additional premium on-top for the snapshot functionality. To calculate an estimated cost of performing snapshots on UKCloud for OpenStack, simply use the following formula: Cost £ = Instance Size (GiB) x Number of Snapshots to be retained (Customer controlled) x Choice of Storage (Tier 1 @ £0.25 or Tier 2 @ £0.10) As an example: If a customer has an 80GiB Tier 2 instance, and performs a snapshot every hour, but only wants to keep the current snapshot, plus the last nine snapshots then: 80 GiB x 10 (snapshots) x £0.10 = £80 per month What are the termination fees? There are no termination costs for this service. Customers are responsible for extracting their own data from the UKCloud for OpenStack service if required. UKCloud may make an additional charge for transferring data out of the service. Security Is two-factor authentication (2FA) available? Yes, it is possible to further protect access to OpenStack's management portal (Horizon) using 2FA. To enable this feature, OpenStack users need to be created in the UKCloud Portal as described here . What data is suitable for the UKCloud assured cloud platform? The service is hosted in the UK and operated by security-cleared staff. It has extensive independent validation (including CESG) that it is fully aligned with the 14 CESG Cloud Security Principles, and is therefore ideal for all data classified at OFFICIAL (including OFFICIAL SENSITIVE). Can systems on different UKCloud platforms communicate with one and another? UKCloud's Cross Domain Security Zone allows customers to use a customer-designed and managed Walled Garden to enable communication between platforms. For more information, see the Cross Domain Security Zone documentation. Is there a protective monitoring service? Protective monitoring is included for our IaaS platform and follows GPG 13.

    "title": "Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for OpenStack",
    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for OpenStack Overview This Getting Started Guide covers basic topics like where to find your instances (virtual machines, or VMs, in VMware terminology), as well as more in-depth topics such as instance storage choice (ephemeral or volume storage) and its implications. Intended audience This guide is intended for users who want to learn more about UKCloud for OpenStack. Logging in to the OpenStack Horizon dashboard To manage your OpenStack projects, you can log in to the OpenStack Horizon dashboard via our Single Sign-On (SSO) service, using your UKCloud Portal credentials. Additionally, if you've set up two-factor authentication (2FA) in the Portal, when logging in using your Portal credentials, you'll be prompted for a 2FA code. Go to the URL provided in your welcome email, for example, https://cor00005.cni.ukcloud.com/ . From the Authenticate using list, select: Keystone Credentials if your account has not been migrated to SSO UKCloud SSO if your account has been migrated to SSO Note If you're using UKCloud SSO , you'll require the v3 version of the OpenStack RC file. You can find more details about the OpenStack RC file in How to use the OpenStack API using an SSO enabled user . If you selected Keystone Credentials , enter your UKCloud Portal login credentials and click Connect . If you selected UKCloud SSO click Connect . After logging in, the first screen you'll see is the Overview page. From here you can get a summary of your project and view your resource usage and the quotas configured on the project. For more information about the Horizon dashboard, see the Introduction to the OpenStack dashboard . Creating your network infrastructure Before you can begin creating instances, you must first build the required network components. In a freshly provisioned project, the only resource that will exist initially is a shared external network called internet . You need to create the following minimum set of resources: A router using the internet external network A network and associated subnet, specifying the network address using CIDR notation (for example, 192.168.1.0/24), and DHCP settings for DNS, any static routes, and so on. A router interface to connect the router to your new subnet When you have created these elements, you can view them in the Network Topology page in the Horizon dashboard. You can create your network infrastructure in one of the following ways: Using Horizon to manually create your infrastructure (see Using Horizon to manually create your infrastructure ) Using the OpenStack Heat orchestration tool to create stacks (see Using the OpenStack Heat orchestration tool to create stacks ) Using the OpenStack API and automation (see Using the OpenStack API and automation ) Using the OpenStack CLI clients (see Command-line clients for UKCloud for OpenStack ) Using Horizon to manually create your infrastructure The Network Topology page is a useful page to get started with. This page provides a resizable, moveable and interactive view of your OpenStack project, along with easily accessible buttons for manually creating routers and networks and for launching instances. To create your network infrastructure: In the Horizon dashboard, expand the Network menu on the left side of the screen and select Network Topology . On the Network Topology page, click the Create Router button. In the Create Router dialog box, enter a Router Name . From the Admin State list, ensure that UP is selected so that the router is online at the point of creation. From the External Network list, select the external network to which you want to attach your router. Click Create Router . Back on the Network Topology page, click the Create Network button. On the Network page of the Create Network wizard, enter a Network Name and click Next . On the Subnet page, enter a Subnet Name . In the Network Address field, allocate your network a suitable address space. In the Gateway IP field, enter an IP address from the address space for the router you created earlier to use to access the network. Click Next . On the Subnet Details page, the only field you'll probably want to change is DNS Name Servers . UKCloud does not provide DNS as a service, so to start with you could make use of Google's public 8.8.8.8 service. You can update this field later if you intend to run your own DNS caching service. If you leave the Allocation Pools field blank, then by default the whole address space is used for the pool. Click Create . To add the router interface to link your new network to the router, on the Network Topology page, select the router and click the Add Interface button. In the Add Interface dialog box, from the Subnet list, select your subnet and then click Add Interface . Understanding access and security Security groups In OpenStack, rather than deploying a perimeter firewall to protect your network from the outside world, every instance is protected by its own firewall. This instance firewall is applied at the network level, independent of any additional firewall the guest operating system may be using. The instance firewall is controlled by applying one or more security groups to the instance, either at instance creation or real-time at any point during the lifecycle of the instance. Where multiple security groups are specified, all the firewall rules in those security groups are applied. A security group consists of one or more rules. Each rule is composed of five elements: Role --- Custom or predefined protocol type (for example, TCP, UDP or ICMP) Direction --- Ingress or Egress Open Port or Port Range --- Open either a single port or a range of ports Remote --- The source of the traffic to be allowed via this rule (source address for an inbound rule, or destination address for an outbound rule) The ether type (that is IPv4 or IPv6) --- Not currently available When adding a new rule to a security group, you can choose from a pre-populated list of common rules, for example, SSH, DNS, HTTP or SMTP, or you can specify your own custom rule. SSH key pairs Another change if you're used to using VMware Cloud Director, is the authenticated access to your instances. OpenStack, like most other cloud providers, doesn't use templates that allow password controlled access. The standard cloud method of authenticating access to a new instance is to use SSH key pair authentication - your SSH client uses the private key and OpenStack injects the public key into your new instance using the cloud-init package pre-installed in the instance image. Before you launch any instances on OpenStack, you need to set up at least one SSH key pair. You can use OpenStack to create a new key pair for you, or if you have an existing SSH key pair, you can import the public key so that OpenStack can use it to inject into new instances. To see what public keys have already been set up for your use: In the Horizon dashboard, expand the Compute menu on the left side of the screen and select Access & Security . Select the Key Pairs tab. If you want OpenStack to create a key pair for you: Click the Create Key Pair button. In the Create Key Pair dialog box, enter a Key Pair Name and then click Create Key Pair . OpenStack creates the key pair and downloads it in your web browser. Save the file somewhere safe as you will need it when connecting your SSH client to your instances. To import an existing public key: On the Key Pairs tab of the Access & Security page, click the Import Key Pair button. In the Import Key Pair dialog box, enter a Key Pair Name and paste the contents of your existing public key file into the Public Key field. Click Import Key Pair . Note for Windows users If you're using a Windows desktop environment, the chances are that you're using the PuTTY program for your SSH client. The PuTTY SSH client doesn't use OpenSSH format files for the key pair files. It does however provide a PuTTYgen program that can import and export in the correct format as outlined below. If you want OpenStack to create your key pair: Open PuTTYgen. From the Conversions menu select Import key . Select the downloaded private key file generated by OpenStack. Click the Save private key button to save the imported key as a ppk file that PuTTY can use for authentication. If you want to import an existing key: Open PuTTYgen. Click the Generate button. Copy the public key from the top of the dialog box. Paste the public key into the Public Key field in Horizon's Import Key Pair dialog box. Launching your instances Now that you've considered security, created a network and a subnet, and you've connected them to your external network with a router, you can start to think about launching some instances attached to the network. There are a few choices you need to make when launching your instances. The following sections outline how to achieve this task via the Horizon dashboard, however you can also use the OpenStack CLI, HEAT templates or the OpenStack API. Choosing your image When you create an instance in OpenStack, its disk is cloned from an image managed by OpenStack. The image may be a custom image that has been developed for a specific purpose and uploaded to your project. It may also be a custom image that has been specifically shared between two projects. More likely, you'll start by using one of the public images that we provide and manage on our platform. You can see the images that are available for you to use by expanding the Compute menu on the left side of the Horizon dashboard and clicking Images . Choosing your instance size If you're already familiar with our UKCloud for VMware service, then you may be used to being able to choose exactly how many vCPUs and how much memory a VM is allocated. In OpenStack, you choices are restricted to a number of pre-defined flavors that define how many vCPUs, how much memory and how much storage an instance may use. Although full details for each flavor are available through the Horizon UI, there's no overall list available showing all the different flavors and sizes of instances. However, if you've installed the OpenStack CLI tools (see http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/common/cli-install-openstack-command-line-clients.html ), you can run the following command to retrieve a list of the flavors and their makeup: \\> openstack flavor list Choosing your storage type There are two storage options available for use with your instances: Ephemeral storage (default) Persistent volume storage Ephemeral storage When you create an instance, the default behaviour is to clone your chosen disk image onto the physical disk attached to the host that will be running the instance. This is not dedicated locally attached storage to your instance, but rather a RAID array of fast SSD disks that is shared by all the instances running on the host hypervisor. The performance of the ephemeral storage makes for very fast disk access. However, as the disk image is stored locally on the host hypervisor, you're at risk of data loss in the event of hardware failure on the host. For scheduled maintenance on the host, you can live‑migrate instances onto other hosts with minimal interruption. If the host were to suffer a hardware failure, it's likely that you'd lose the data stored on the disk image, so you should architect your application to expect and be able to recover from failure. Persistent volume storage As an alternative to ephemeral storage you can clone your chosen disk image to an OpenStack volume , which is a persistent storage option backed by a Ceph storage array. The volume is then network mounted onto the host hypervisor and the instance booted from the network attached storage. For scheduled maintenance on the host, these instances are more easily managed onto other hosts. In the event of a hardware failure on the host, the volume can just be mounted to another host and the instance restarted without any data loss. For more information about volumes, see Working with volumes . Creating an instance You can create a new instance in the Horizon UI. Click or select Launch Instance on one of the following pages: Images page (under the Compute menu) Instances page (under the Compute menu) Network Topology page (under the Networks menu) On the Details tab of the Launch Instance dialog box, enter an Instance Name and select a Flavor . As you select a flavor from the list, the dialog box updates to reflect the VCPUs , Disk and RAM that the selected flavour gives you and the green bars under Project Limits update to show what your usage would be after launching the instance. If you select a flavour that would take you over your project's quota, the bar is red rather than green. From the Instance Boot Source list, select: Boot from image to create an instance that boots from the local ephemeral storage. Boot from image (creates a new volume) to create an instance that boots from a volume From the Image Name list, select your preferred image. If you're creating an image that boots from a volume, you can choose what size to create the boot disk without being restricted to the disk allocation specified by the selected flavour. On the Access & Security tab, from the Key Pair list, select the SSH key pair you want to inject into your new instance. If there is only one SSH key pair configured in your project, it will be automatically selected. Select one or more Security Groups to apply to the instance. On the Networking tab, from the Available networks list, select the network that you want to create the new instance on. If your project has only a single network defined, that network will already be listed under Selected networks . Click Launch and OpenStack reports that your new instance is launching. Accessing your instance Having successfully launched your new instance, you'll want to log in and start installing your applications. To access your new instance from the outside world, you have to associate a floating IP address to the instance. A floating IP address is a public routable address that is allocated to your project. Having allocated an address to your project, you can then choose to associate it to a particular instance. When you've done this, a DNAT rule is automatically created on the router you created earlier to forward all incoming traffic to your chosen instance. To associate a floating IP address to your new instance: On the Instances page, from the Actions list for your instance, select Associate Floating IP . In the Manage Floating IP Associations dialog box, from the IP Address list, select the floating IP address that you want to allocate to the instance. If you don't have any spare floating IP addresses allocated to your project, you can click the + button next to the IP Address list to allocate a new address. In the Allocate Floating IP dialog box, from the Pool list, select the pool from which to allocate the floating IP address. Currently the only option is internet , but the list will expand as additional networks come online. Click Allocate IP to allocate the new floating IP address to your project. Back in the Manage Floating IP Associations dialog box, associate the new address with your instance. Click Allocate IP . You can use your SSH client to connect to the floating IP address, authenticating the connection with the private key that matches the key pair you selected when you launched the instance. You can find more information about using and controlling instances and images on OpenStack in the Red Hat documentation at https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/8/instances-and-images-guide/instances-and-images-guide . Working with volumes Creating a volume Volumes are block devices that you can attach to instances. Because volumes are replicated across OpenStack's storage array, effectively providing three copies of data from a resilience perspective, they provide the basis of our persistent storage offering. In the Horizon dashboard, expand the Compute menu on the left side of the screen and select Volumes . On the Volumes page, click the Create Volume button. In the Create Volume dialog box, enter a Volume Name and Description . From the Volume Source list, select: No source, empty volume to create a totally empty volume for customer to populate with their data (this is the default option) Image to enable customer to create a prepopulated volume from a previously created image From the Volume Type list, select: Tier 1 for our most performant block storage for workloads requiring consistently higher disk throughput Tier 2 for block storage with typical performance characteristics for use by production applications or storage (this is the default option) From the Size list, select the size of your volume in GiB. From the Availability Zone list, select the availability zone to which you want to target your volume. Create Create Volume . Retyping a volume You can retype a volume to take an existing volume of a particular volume type and converting it to another (that is, from Tier 1 to Tier 2 or vice versa). Retyping a volume attached to an instance Due to a dependency on the underlying hypervisor, it is not currently possible to retype a volume that is attached to an instance. If you want to retype a volume that is attached to an instance, you must first detach the volume from the instance. To detach the volume from the instance, in the Horizon dashboard, expand the Compute menu on the left side of the screen and select Volumes . On the Volumes page, for the volume that you want to detach, from the list on the far right of the page, select Manage Attachments . In the Manage Volume Attachments dialog box, click the Detach Volume button. Retype the volume by following the steps in Retyping an independent volume . On the Volumes page, for the volume that you want to reattach, from the list on the far right, select Manage Attachments . In the Manage Volume Attachments dialog box, from the Attach to Instance list, select the instance to which you want to reattach the volume and click the Attach Volume button. Note If you attempt to retype a volume that is still attached to an instance, the process will attempt to run but will fail without notification. Retyping an independent volume If the volume that you want to retype is not attached to an instance, you can retype it. Ensure that the volume is detached from any instances. For information about how to detach an volume from an instance, see Retyping a volume attached to an instance . In the Horizon dashboard, expand the Compute menu on the left side of the screen and select Volumes . On the Volumes page, for the volume that you want to retype, from the list on the far right of the page, select Change Volume Type . In the Change Volume Type dialog box, from the Type drop down list, select the new type for the volume. From the Migration Policy list, ensure that you select On Demand . Note If any other option is selected, the retyping process will not work. Click Change Volume Type . Note You may notice duplicate volumes while the retyping process is running. These duplicate volumes will disappear when the process has completed. Important Do not attach a retyped volume to an instance until the retyping process has completed successfully. Retyping an independent volume using the OpenStack CLI To retype a volume using the OpenStack CLI, use the following command: \\> cinder retype *volume* *volume-type* Where: volume is the name or ID of the volume that you want to retype volume-type is the new volume type Working with the API and automation Using the OpenStack Heat orchestration tool to create stacks OpenStack provides an orchestration tool out of the box. The Heat tool enables you to describe your infrastructure as a text file, referred to as a Heat template , defining one or more resources using a YAML format. Having defined your resources in your Heat template, you then use the template to create a stack . The stack contains the instantiation of the resources defined in the YAML file, along with a history of events and operations that have happened to the resources in the stack. For an example of what a basic Heat template looks like, take a look at https://github.com/UKCloud/automation_examples/blob/master/heat/example.yaml The example.yaml template creates the same router, network, subnet and router interface that you created manually above. In addition, the template defines an SSH key pair, security groups and launch instances. We'll look at these other resource elements in more detail later. To use a template to create a stack in your project: In the Horizon dashboard, expand the Orchestration menu on the left side of the screen and select Stacks . On the Stacks page, click the Launch Stack button. On the Select Template page, from the Template Source list, select URL . In the Template URL field, enter the URL of the Raw version of the template that you want to use (for example, the example.yaml template). Click Next . On the Launch Stack page, enter a Stack Name and select the flavour and image as required. Click Launch to start creating the stack resources in the background. You can go back to the Stacks page to view progress, drill down into the resources defined in the stack and see the events as they happen. You can also use an updated Heat template to apply an update to resources in a stack. You can also destroy an entire stack, cleaning up all the resources that you previously created. This makes Heat a very powerful tool for creating short‑lived test and preproduction environments on‑demand that may form part of a continuous delivery pipeline. Using the OpenStack API and automation OpenStack also provides a fully functional API to enable programmatic control over your project. The Horizon UI you used earlier is itself a client that makes calls to this underlying API. Although you can write your own code to interact with the API, there are a number of different libraries already available covering most popular programming languages. Alternatively, there is also a growing number of DevOps automation tools available (for example, Terraform and Ansible) that interact with the OpenStack API to orchestrate the creation and ongoing management of your infrastructure. For an example Terraform configuration to create a similar network infrastructure to the one you created in the previous examples, take a look at https://github.com/UKCloud/automation_examples/tree/master/terraform-os . Whatever library or automation tools you choose to use, you'll need to know a few important details to make a connection to and authenticate against the API. In the Horizon dashboard, expand the Compute menu on the left side of the screen and select Access & Security . On the Access and Security page, select the API Access tab. On the API Access tab, you can see all the relevant API endpoints for making connections to the various OpenStack subsystems, including the Identify endpoint, which provides the initial authentication process that you'll typically need when configuring connections. You can also download your user's OpenStack RC file for use in the following section. Note If your account is SSO-enabled, download the v3 RC file and make the modifications stated here . Using the OpenStack command-line client The OpenStack project provides a command‑line client that enables you to access the project API through easy‑to‑use commands. For example, the compute service provides a NOVA command‑line client. You can run the commands from the command line, or include the commands in scripts to automate tasks. If you provide OpenStack credentials, such as your user name and password, you can run these commands on any computer. The following file is a bash shell script format file that sets up all the relevant environment variables in the Linux shell session so that you can use the OpenStack CLI tools. The OpenStack CLI tools, just like the Horizon UI, also communicate with the OpenStack API. This means you can examine the contents of the RC file to find the settings that you may need to pass into, for example, a Terraform provider definition when configuring it to manage your OpenStack project. The key values to note here are the OS_AUTH_URL , OS_TENANT_NAME and OS_USERNAME environment variables, as these will be common to any API authentication request. In addition, creating the line export OS_INTERFACE=public in the RC file should address any issues you may have accessing the Admin API endpoints. Next steps In this Getting Started Guide, you've learned how to use the OpenStack Horizon UI to set up UKCloud for OpenStack and create new instances. You've also learned about the other tools available including the OpenStack API and command-line client. You can find additional information in the following places: OpenStack API --- For more information about using the API, see the OpenStack documentation at https://developer.openstack.org/api-guide/quick-start/ OpenStack Client --- For more information about using the OpenStack Client, see the OpenStack documentation at http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/cli.html HEAT templates --- You can find more information about the Heat orchestration tool and the resources you can use in the YAML format templates in the OpenStack documentation at https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Heat and https://docs.openstack.org/developer/heat/template_guide/index.html Terraform --- For information about using Terraform and the OpenStack provider, see the Terraform documentation at https://www.terraform.io/intro/ and https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/openstack/index.html Ansible --- For information on Ansible's support for working with OpenStack resources, see the Ansible documentation at https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/list_of_cloud_modules.html#openstack Related videos OpenStack Horizon dashboard overview video Glossary This section provides a glossary of terms specific to UKCloud for OpenStack.

    "keywords": "How to configure an OpenStack instance using cloud-config Overview When you boot an instance in OpenStack you can pass configuration to the instance as cloud-config (sometimes called user-data). This enables you to quickly and easily make configuration changes at boot time. Use cases The following list provides some examples of how you can use cloud-config to configure an instance: Setting a default locale Setting an instance hostname Generating instance SSH private keys Adding SSH keys to a user's .ssh/authorized_keys so they can log in Setting up ephemeral mount points Configuring network devices Running config scripts at startup Example You can deploy cloud-config via the command line or via the OpenStack Horizon GUI. In this guide, we use the CLI, but you can use the same script via the GUI by pasting it into the Configuration tab. As an example, let's boot an instance and run some arbitrary commands at boot time. Create a new text file called user-data.txt . Add the following to the new file. #cloud-config runcmd: - mkdir -pv /root/cloud-config-test - touch /root/cloud-config-test/boottest - echo \"boot instance test\" >> /root/cloud-config-test/boottest Note You must include the #cloud-config line at the top of the file. Boot an instance using the CLI, adding --user-data user-data.txt to the end of the boot command. When the instance has booted, log into the instance, switch to root and look in the directory. You will see the new file, and it will contain boot instance test . This is a very simple example of what you can do with cloud-config, but you can see from this simple example that you can easily start to build fairly complicated setup scripts.

    "title": "How to configure IPsec VPN in OpenStack",
    "keywords": "How to configure IPsec VPN in OpenStack Overview This article provides instructions for deploying an instance into your OpenStack project to function as a VPN endpoint, enabling secure connection: To other projects To VMware Cloud Director VDCs Back to your own infrastructure in-house Before you begin This article uses a pfSense virtual firewall appliance to provide the IPsec VPN endpoint. UKCloud provides a UKCloud for OpenStack image for the pfSense appliance in the public catalog, however, you can upload your own image if you prefer. You can find the HEAT templates and other files used in this article in the UKCloud GitHub repository at https://github.com/UKCloud/vpn-on-openstack . The repository contains the following: pfsense.yaml - A HEAT template to deploy all the resources needed for an IPsec VPN endpoint properties.yaml - The HEAT parameters used with the pfsense.yaml template infrastructure.yaml - A sample HEAT template to deploy all the prerequisite infrastructure used by the pfsense.yaml template vshield-configuration-yaml - A sample configuration to set up a edge gateway as an IPsec endpoint on a VDC Network infrastructure requirements The pfsense.yaml HEAT template used in this article assumes that you've already started deploying network resources and instances in your OpenStack project, and that you now want to set up an IPsec VPN tunnel to connect your project to external resources. It assumes that the following resources already exist: A network and subnet on which you're creating instances A router to connect your subnet to your internet-facing external network An SSH keypair used to create instances A jumpbox or bastion Linux server instance created on your subnet A floating IP address allocated and assigned to your jumpbox instance A security group allowing inbound SSH access to your jumpbox instance If you've not already created these resources, we've provided a sample HEAT template ( infrastructure.yaml ) in the GitHub repository to get you started. This template creates the resources listed above for you, including an internal network with the subnet 192.168.1.0/24 that uses: An allocation pool of 192.168.1.20-192.168.1.200 Google's public DNS server: 8.8.8.8 To deploy the infrastructure.yaml template, pass the following URL directly into the OpenStack Horizon dashboard: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UKCloud/vpn-on-openstack/master/infrastructure.yaml Alternatively, you can clone the repository locally and use the OpenStack CLI to create the stack with the following command: openstack stack create --parameter flavor=t1.small --parameter image=\"CentOS 7\" --wait -t infrastructure.yaml Infrastructure Setting up the VPN stack The pfSense appliance assumes that if will have at least two network interface controllers (NICs) attached to it: one attached to the WAN and one or more attached to internal networks. To fit this into an existing infrastructure deployed in your project, and to avoid any nasty routing loops, the pfsense.yaml HEAT template creates a new WAN network along with an interface on your existing router. This provides the WAN interface for pfSense and has a floating IP address associated with it for the internet-facing endpoint of the VPN tunnel. The LAN interface of the pfSense appliance attaches to your existing internal network. Both WAN and LAN interfaces in the pfSense appliance image in the public catalog are configured for DHCP. This enables the interface to seamlessly configure against your existing infrastructure. Preparing your configuration Use the pfsense.yaml and properties.yaml files provided in the UKCloud GitHub repository to prepare your infrastructure. If you haven't already done so, clone or take a copy of the repository on the UKCloud GitHub: https://github.com/UKCloud/vpn-on-openstack Update the properties.yaml files to suit your deployed infrastructure. For example, if you used the infrastructure.yaml HEAT template provided to build your core infrastructure, the properties should look similar to the following: parameters: key_name: jumpbox_key pfsense_flavor: t1.tiny router: InternetGW internal_network: Internal internal_address: 192.168.1.254 internal_net_cidr: 192.168.1.0/24 remote_net_cidr: 10.1.1.0/24 where: InternetGW is the name of your router Internal is the name of your existing network internal_address is the address on your existing network that will be assigned to the LAN interface on the appliance Note The pfsense.yaml HEAT template assumes that your VPN tunnel is connecting to only a single remote network. If you need to route to multiple remote networks, after completing the deployment, you'll need to follow a few more configuration steps. For more information, ask to speak to one of our DevOps consultants or Cloud Architects. Launching the stack Use the OpenStack CLI tools to launch the stack by running the following command: openstack stack create --enable-rollback -t pfsense.yaml -e properties.yaml --wait VPNStack You can also launch the stack through the Horizon dashboard by selecting the pfsense.yaml and properties.yaml files appropriately when prompted. Creating the VPN tunnel Connecting to the pfSense UI When the HEAT template has finished deploying your VPN stack, connect to the pfSense appliance to configure the IPsec tunnel. You can perform some configuration steps through the OpenStack console, or an SSH connection to the appliance, however, most configuration is via the pfSense web UI. The pfSense UI only listens on its LAN interface, so you cannot use it directly via the internet-facing floating IP address on its WAN interface. Connect to the pfSense UI using SSH port forwarding to tunnel a connection through the jumpbox server connected to the internal network, onto the LAN interface of the pfSense appliance. With a command line SSH client, you would typically run the following command: ssh -i ~/.ssh/jumpbox.pem -l jumpboxuser -L 80:192.168.1.254:80 <jumpbox floating IP address> where: 192.168.1.254 is the address allocated to the LAN interface of the appliance If you're using a Windows desktop, you may want to try using PuTTY for the SSH port forwarding. Browse to http://localhost/ to open the pfSense Login page. Log in with: Username: admin Password: If you're using the image provided by UKCloud, the default password is Password123# Important You should change the default password when you first log in. Setting up your IPsec tunnel For the purposes of this article, we're assuming the following tunnel configuration. You'll need to substitute your own values accordingly: OpenStack Network pfSense VPN Endpoint Remote Network ----------------- ------- ------------ -------------- LAN: 192.168.1.254 LAN: 10.1.1.1 192.168.1.0/24 <---> WAN: 172.16.1.XXX <--------> WAN: YYY.YYY.YYY.YYY <---> 10.1.1.0/24 Floating IP: XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX Pre-shared Key: D3v0psD3m0D3v0psD3m0D3v0psD3m0D3v0psD3m0 From the menu, select VPN > IPsec . On the Tunnels tab, click the Add P1 button to start configuring this endpoint of the tunnel. In the Edit Phase 1 page, set the following values: Remote Gateway: YYY.YYY.YYY.YYY Description: My VPN Connection My identifier: IP Address XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX Peer identifier: IP Address: YYY.YYY.YYY.YYY Pre-Shared Key: D3v0psD3m0D3v0psD3m0D3v0psD3m0D3v0psD3m0 Save the settings. Click the Add P2 button to complete the rest of the tunnel configuration. In the Edit Phase 2 page, set the following values: Local Network: LAN subnet NAT/BINAT translation: None Remote Network: Network 10.1.1.0/24 Description: My remote network Save the settings. The Tunnels page should now look something like the following: Creating a firewall rule to allow routing of returning traffic The default firewall rules allow outbound traffic from the LAN network. This is sufficient to enable the IPsec tunnel to be established and to also allow traffic from the internal network to be routed across the tunnel. However, to allow returning traffic from the remote network to be routed back to the LAN network, you need to add a new firewall rule. From the menu, select Firewall > Rules . Select the IPsec tab. For this article, since we're trusting all traffic from the LAN network to the remote network, we just need to add a single rule to accept all traffic from the remote network back into the LAN network. In your environment, you'll probably want to be more specific with your rule definitions. Click one of the Add buttons and set the following values: Action: Pass Interface: IPsec Protocol: any Source: Network 10.1.1.0/24 Destination: LAN net Description: Allow all remote traffic Save the rule. The IPsec tab should now look something like the following: Configuring a static route for the remote network The last thing to do to configure your OpenStack project to be able to connect to a remote network over the IPsec VPN is to update your router configuration to add a static route that redirects traffic for the remote network via the pfSense appliance. You can do this by editing the router in the Horizon dashboard, specifying the remote network and the LAN interface of the pfSense appliance. Alternatively, you can define the same static route using the OpenStack CLI: 'openstack router set --route destination=10.1.1.0/24,gateway=192.168.1.254 InternetGW` Configuring the second endpoint At this point, you now want to ensure that the other end of the VPN tunnel is also configured. If you are connecting two OpenStack projects, you can repeat the steps above to deploy another pfSense appliance into the remote project. Connecting an IPsec tunnel to an edge gateway in a UKCloud for VMware environment can be problematic, as the VMware Cloud Director web console doesn't set the local identifier correctly. You have to use a REST client against the vCloud API to manually correct the tunnel configuration. This process is documented in How to change IPsec VPN settings via the vCloud API . However, we also provide a Ruby script in our GitHub repository that you can use, with the vshield-configuration.yaml sample configuration file, to automate the interaction with the vCloud API to correctly set up the VPN endpoint from scratch, without having to use the web console. For more information about this script, see here . Check the tunnel status By now, if the configuration of both endpoints match, the IPsec tunnel should already have completed both Phase 1 and Phase 2 negotiations and have established a tunnel. You can check by selecting Status > IPsec from the menu. Feedback If you find an issue with this article, click Improve this Doc to suggest a change.

This article provides advice on how to update your existing Red Hat instances (virtual machines) to target UKCloud's approved RHUI. Prerequisites There are two prerequisites for performing this operation: The host can resolve to the RHUI DNS records (contact Customer Support for the IP addresses and domain names for these records). You can achieve this by configuring an A record on your local DNS or configuring an /etc/hosts file with the appropriate information. For internet connectivity, the required domain name is in public DNS. All hosts using the service must be able to access the local RHUI server on port 443 (HTTPS). Ensure that the configured Security Groups allow outbound connectivity on port 443. If you have any questions on this, contact UKCloud Support. Installation You can find the installer RPM files in an ISO image. Before you can mount this to an existing instance, you'll need to create a volume from the image. In the Horizon Web UI, locate the image UKCloud-RHUI-Standard-Assured.iso , click the action button and select Create Volume . Use the default settings presented by the dialog to copy the ISO to a 1GB Tier 2 volume, and click Create Volume . Locate the Red Hat instance where you want to install RHUI support and select Attach Volume . Select the newly created volume and then click Attach Volume . Select the instance name and check at the bottom of the Instance Overview to see that the volume is attached, and what its device name is. As root, mount the volume inside the VM, using the device name from step 5. Install the relevant RPM. For example, for RHEL7: rpm -ivh IL2-Client-RHEL7-Standard-2.0-1.noarch.rpm . Clean yum: yum clean all Test the RHUI is working: yum update The first time you update from RHUI you may be prompted to accept the following two certificates: The Red Hat entitlement certificate The Client entitlement certificate Troubleshooting The primary issues you may encounter are: DNS Failure Check the DNS lookup is working and you have the correct entry for Assured. 443 not accessible Check your firewall configuration, including local firewalls (iptables) and security groups applied to instances.

    "keywords": "How to move resources between OpenStack regions Overview This article provides examples of how to move OpenStack resources (for example, instance images and volumes) between the different independent regions currently offered by UKCloud to help ensure the highest level of application resilience and availability. Intended audience Anyone responsible for the design and implementation of applications and services deployed on UKCloud OpenStack service, and should be familiar with using the OpenStack dashboard and API/CLI. Background UKCloud's OpenStack service has been engineered specifically for today's modern, digital, cloud based applications. Unlike our VMware service, OpenStack expects applications to be designed with resilience engineered at the application level, rather than relying upon the underlying cloud infrastructure. To cater for this, our OpenStack service offers the following two resiliency concepts: Regions - Where applications are served from a choice of multiple regions (for example, data centres) with each region having independent, isolated control (for example, dashboard, API), data (for example, compute workloads) and storage (for example, persistent block volumes) planes. Engineering your applications to span multiple regions offers the greatest level of resilience, however requires effort from a design and implementation perspective. Zones - Where applications are served from a single region (for example, data centre) and share a single control plane and resilient storage, however the data plane (for example, compute workloads) can be placed within different fault tolerant failure domains. Zones offer a lower level of resilience when compared to regions, however they require the least effort to utilise. UKCloud strongly recommends engineering across multiple regions for any production workloads. OpenStack regions & zones The following table outlines the regions and zones that are currently available on the OpenStack service: Site Region Zone Corsham 00005 (cor00005.cni.ukcloud.com) 0000c-1 0000c-2 Farnborough 00006 (frn00006.cni.ukcloud.com) 00021-1 00021-2 Corsham 2 00005 (cor00005-2.cni.ukcloud.com) 00026-1 00026-2 Details correct at date of publication. Current details can be found in the UKCloud Knowledge Centre. Migrating instances between regions UKCloud has deliberately engineered its regions to be fully independent to allow a high level of isolation and customer control as to which resources and data is shared/distributed. As a result, the only way to share instances between regions is to export them from the current region, then import them into the new region. The following provides a code example of how to achieve this export and import of an image using the OpenStack CLI: To identify the id of the source instance: Source the originating region's cred rc file Enter the following command: openstack server list Note the ID of your source instance as shown in the resulting output. To create the snapshot of the source instance, enter the following command: openstack server image create --name <snapshot-name> <id-of-server> Note the id shown in the resulting output. To check image has finished creating, enter the following command: openstack image show <id-of-image> Once complete, the status field should show as active . To download source image snapshot, enter the following command: openstack image save <id-of-image-to-download> --file <image-name> If the image size is greater than the memory of the local host, the following may be required: glance image-download --file <output-location> --progress <id-of-image-to-download> Note As glance CLI commands don't work with SSO accounts, you'll need a keystone user to run this command. Contact UKCloud Support to request a keystone account, if necessary. To upload source image to the target region: Source the target region's cred rc file Enter the following command: openstack image create --file <path-to-file-to-upload> --disk-format qcow2 --container-format bare <name-for-upload> You can now start the migrated instance from file you've just uploaded. Migrating volumes between regions As with instances, volumes have been engineered to be fully independent across regions. For moving volumes two options are available. Option 1 - Direct transfer between instances Once instances have been migrated (see above) and are running, data can be copied directly between the instances. To achieve this across different regions, the use of a VPN may be required.

Option 2 - Export and import of existing volumes Detach the volume to be migrated from all instances to ensure all writes are completed. a. To show a list of all volumes in your project: Source the originating region's cred rc file Enter the following command: openstack volume list If your source volume shows as being Attached to in the resulting output then note the ID of your source volume and proceed to step 1b, otherwise note the ID of your source volume and proceed to step 2. b. To detach your source volume from an instance, enter the following command: openstack server remove volume \\<server id\\> \\<volume id\\> Double check the volume has been detached by running the command in step 1a. Upload the source volume to the OpenStack Glance image repository using the following command: openstack image create --volume <volume id> <name> Download the source volume image to your local device using the following command: openstack image save <id-of-image-to-download> --file <image-name> If the image size is greater than the memory of the local host, the following may be required: glance image-download --file <output-location> --progress <id-of-image-to-download> Note As glance CLI commands don't work with SSO accounts, you'll need a keystone user to run this command. Contact UKCloud Support to request a keystone account, if necessary. To upload the source volume image to the target region: Source the target region's cred rc file Enter the following command: openstack image create --file <path-to-file-to-upload> --disk-format raw --container-format bare <name-for-upload> To create a new volume in the target region based upon the original source volume, enter the following command: openstack volume create --image <uploaded-image> --size <size-of-volume-to-create> --type <TIER1/TIER2> <Name> Next steps You can find more information about UKCloud's sites, regions and zones in the following Knowledge Centre articles: Understanding sites, regions and zones UKCloud services by region You can find full details for the OpenStack command-line interface (OpenStack CLI) at: https://access.redhat.com/webassets/avalon/d/Red_Hat_OpenStack_Platform-10-Command-Line_Interface_Reference_Guide-en-US/Red_Hat_OpenStack_Platform-10-Command-Line_Interface_Reference_Guide-en-US.pdf Feedback If you find a problem with this article, click Improve this Doc to make the change yourself or raise an issue in GitHub.

    "keywords": "How to manage how your instance recovers from a host failure Overview UKCloud monitors UKCloud for OpenStack at regular intervals, checking for issues with the hardware or services supporting OpenStack. When a host experiences problems, our engineers will take steps to live migrate any instances on the affected host to an alternative one, however there may be cases where a host needs to be rebooted prior to any live migrations being successfully actioned. This guide outlines UKCloud's policy for handling OpenStack instances in the event of a service interruption to the availability of a host. The guide also describes how you can control the running state instances return when a host has been recovered. How does instance recovery work? If a host restarts, or if we have to reboot a host before live migrating your instances, any instances running on that host will be shut off. When we recover a host, there are two options for the recovery state of any instances that may have been affected: Manual restart of instance (default) - you must restart any affected instances when the host has been recovered Automatic restart of an instance - UKCloud will automatically restart any shut off instances on a recovered host You can set the recovery option for each of your instances in the instance metadata. Using the OpenStackClient command-line interface You can use the OpenStackClient command-line interface (CLI) to view and set the instance recovery option as follows: Checking the recovery option for an instance (CLI) To use the OpenStackClient CLI to check the recovery option for an instance: Run the following command from the OpenStackClient CLI: openstack server show <instance_ID_or_name> If the properties field in the results includes RestartOnFail='True' (as shown below), then your instance is set to automatically restart when the host has been recovered. If the properties field does not include RestartOnFail , then your instance will remain in a shut off state when the host has been recovered and you'll have to manually restart it. Setting the recovery option for an instance (CLI) To use the OpenStackClient CLI to set the recovery option for an instance: To set the recovery option so that the instance is automatically restarted when the host has been recovered, run the following command: openstack server set --property RestartOnFail=True <instance_ID_or_name> To set the recovery option so that you must manually restart the instance when the host has been recovered, run the following command: openstack server unset --property RestartOnFail <instance_ID_or_name> Using the OpenStack Horizon dashboard If you prefer, you can use the OpenStack Horizon dashboard to view and set the recovery option for an instance. Checking the recovery option for an instance (Horizon) To use the Horizon dashboard to check the recovery option for an instance: In the left side of the Horizon dashboard, expand the Compute menu and click Instances . On the Instances page, from the Actions list for your instance, select Update Metadata . In the Update Instance Metadata dialog box, if the Existing Metadata section includes the RestartOnFail='True' (as shown below), then your instance is set to automatically restart when the host has been recovered. If the Existing Metadata section does not include the RestartOnFail tag, then your instance will remain in a shut off state when the host has been recovered and you'll have to manually restart it. Setting the recovery option for an instance (Horizon) To use the Horizon dashboard to set the recovery option for an instance: In the left side of the Horizon dashboard, expand the Compute menu and click Instances . On the Instances page, from the Actions list for your instance, select Update Metadata . In the Update Instance Metadata dialog box: To set the recovery option so that the instance is automatically restarted when the host has been recovered, in the Custom field, enter RestartOnFail and click the + button. Then, in the RestartOnFail field, enter True . To set the recovery option so that you must manually restart the instance when the host has been recovered, next to the RestartOnFail field, click the – button. Click Save . Exclusions to UKCloud-managed instance recovery Although we've designed UKCloud for OpenStack to provide a level of hardware resilience, UKCloud, like most true cloud vendors, cannot guarantee total automated recovery of virtual resources in the event of infrastructure failures. As a result, you must ensure that the applications you deploy on OpenStack have been engineered to tolerate any infrastructure issues or failures through utilising multiple instances deployed across different zones to help ensure the overall availability of your solution.

Open the project you want to manage. From the menu, select Access & Security and then select the API Access tab. Click Download OpenStack RC File and save the file in a convenient place. Note If your OpenStack user account is SSO-enabled, see How to use the OpenStack API using an SSO enabled user for the changes you need to make to the RC file for SSO. Download the Source-OpenRC.ps1 PowerShell script and save it locally. As the downloaded PowerShell script is unsigned, you'll need to unblock it by right-clicking the file, selecting Properties , then clicking the Unblock button and clicking OK . Start Windows PowerShell from the Start menu. Run the downloaded PowerShell script, and give the path to the downloaded RC file as an argument, for example: C:\\Downloads\\Source-OpenRC.ps1 C:\\Downloads\\project-openrc.sh Note Replace Downloads with the directory you saved your files to and replace project-openrc.sh with the openrc.sh filename you downloaded. When prompted, enter your OpenStack project password. Test your configuration Now you've installed and configured the everything, you can start using the command line tools. Note You'll need to run the PowerShell script defined above, and provide your OpenStack project credentials every time you relaunch PowerShell. Test if everything is working with a simple list command: openstack server list If you've started with an empty project, you'll get output similar to the following: +----+------+--------+------------+-------------+----------+ | ID | Name | Status | Task State | Power State | Networks | +----+------+--------+------------+-------------+----------+ +----+------+--------+------------+-------------+----------+ Note If you enter your password incorrectly, you will see a message similar to: The request you have made requires authentication. (HTTP 401) (Request-ID: req-..) Upgrading clients The community regularly releases updates to the OpenStack CLI, therefore we suggest you check for updates to the client to ensure you have access to all the latest features; this can also help to resolve errors you experience when using the OpenStack CLI. Upgrade pip Open a command prompt with Admin rights by right-clicking on the command prompt icon (when you get a login prompt, enter your admin credentials). Upgrade pip by entering the following command: python -m pip install --upgrade pip Note Once successfully upgraded, leave the command prompt open for the next step. Upgrade the OpenStack Command Line client Install pip with the following command: pip install --upgrade python-openstackclient Installing the client may take between 1 to 5 minutes depending upon your machine.

    "keywords": "How to migrate workloads on OpenStack using Hystax Acura Overview Hystax Acura offers a fully automated and reliable way to lift-and-shift all types of OpenStack workloads without experiencing downtime or complications arising from large-scale migration. Hystax supports all popular OpenStack distributions including UKCloud's Red Hat OpenStack. Hystax offers a sustainable solution to achieve zero downtime during the OpenStack migration process. The instance keeps running throughout the migration, which is important when it's not an option to stop the applications running on the instance. Overcome common transfer challenges like high costs, long transfer times and security concerns – all in a single product. Lifting-and-shifting workloads to a chosen OpenStack distribution is more manageable than ever before. This article provides instructions from the Hystax Acura Cloud Migration Step-by-Step Guide for how to migrate workloads using Hystax Acura. Prerequisites To utilise Hystax Acura cloud migration services, you'll first need a Hystax user account provisioned in the Hystax Acura Control Panel. You can request a Hystax user account by raising a ticket in the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. Understanding concepts Before starting to use Hystax Acura, it's helpful to understand a few commonly used terms and concepts. Hystax Acura Control Panel Hystax Acura Control Panel is a management portal deployed and managed by UKCloud. The Hystax Acura Control Panel enables an OpenStack user to create and manage all their workload migration requirements. Note All Hystax components are deployed and contained within UKCloud's infrastructure. No customer data is shared or transmitted to any third party. Hystax Acura agents These are the agents that are installed within a guest Linux or Windows operating system, which communicate with the Hystax Acura Control Panel to coordinate and manage workload migrations. Migrating OpenStack workloads Important Ensure that you've created a network and conntected to a router on the target project. It's advisable to replicate the network configuration and RFC1918 IP schema onto the target project to avoid any configuration issues. The target instance must be connected to a network and router for the Hystax agent to replicate the instance. To perform cloud migration you need to complete the following steps: Replication flow Login to the Hystax Acura Control Panel and navigate to a customer dashboard for a customer you target to perform migration. On a customer dashboard you can find information about replicated machines, Migration Plans and Migrations running on a target cloud. By default, no resources are available for a new customer. Click Download agents in the main menu, select a customer for which machines need to be replicated and download a replication agent. For OpenStack workload migrations there are two types of replication agents: Windows agent - an internal agent that can be deployed to any number of customer Windows virtual or physical machines. Refer to http://docs.hystax.com/devices_protection.html#install-windows-and-linux-agents and the Operating Systems Compatibility Matrix . Linux agent - an internal agent that can be deployed to any number of customer Linux virtual or physical machines. Refer to http://docs.hystax.com/devices_protection.html#install-windows-and-linux-agents and the Operating Systems Compatibility Matrix . When any of the agents are deployed, the machine with the Hystax agent will appear in Hystax Acura Control Panel under customer dashboard in the Discovered state. To start replication of machines, select the machines and click Start replication under Bulk actions or for any of the machines specifically. After Start replication is performed, machines will be replicated to a target cloud, first, Hystax Acura takes full replica and, later, incremental replicas according to a schedule set globally for all the machines or for any group of machines or for any machines specifically. To change the replication schedule, navigate to Replication schedule under a machine settings or bulk actions. Refer to http://docs.hystax.com/dr_overview.html#edit-replication-schedule for more information on configuring the settings. Run migration flow Migration is based on Migration Plans, which are scenarios of what needs to be migrated and in what order. Refer to http://docs.hystax.com/dr_overview.html#disaster-recovery-plans for more information about Migration Plans. To create a Migration Plan click Add on Migration Plans region. While creating a Migration Plan, orchestration is available under Basic and Expert modes. Basic mode helps to generate a plan with standard settings, expert mode is a JSON script with more powerful settings described under http://docs.hystax.com/dr_overview.html#dr-plan-syntax . Add all the machines which need to be migrated, place them into ranks, set correct IP addresses, networks and boot delays. When the Migration Plan is ready, you can run test or production failovers. To run a migration, select a Migration Plan and click Run Migration. Select a restore point for the migration by selecting Restore point time. For all of the machines selected the closest snapshot in the past will be taken. Click Run Migration to start the process. When a migration is running, you can see and control its status on the Cloud Site page available via customer dashboard. When you are done with test migration you can delete it and start a new one. For the final cutover, just detach Hystax Acura from the migration and Hystax Acura will stop tracking any resources belonging to this migration. Important Cleanup procedure Once the instance / workload has been replicated and is running, raise a service request to flatten the replicated volume of the target instance. After you've had confirmation that the volume has been flattened and you're happy the instance is working as expected, you can delete the workload from Hystax Acura. Known issues The Hystax Acura service is under constant development. The following are the known issues in the current release of the software, which should be resolved in the next release. Creation of new persistent volumes on target instances When the Hystax migration completes, the disk of the resulting new/target instances will use persistent volumes and snapshots. This may result in extra monthly storage costs. Migrating Ubuntu workloads Due to the way in which the Hystax software works, you may experience issues migrating an Ubuntu server/instance with the default disk mount settings. In Ubuntu, the root risk ( / ) is mounted by label (that is, in /etc/fstab there is a setting that states LABEL=\"….\" for the \" / \" disk). You need to modify this to use the UUID or device name (for example, /dev/vdb1 ). Run the following steps on a default Ubuntu setup for a successful migration: Ensure /etc/fstab refers to the boot and root disks using UUID=\"\" or /dev/vda1 , and so on, and not by LABEL=\"\" (you can retrieve the device name using the lsblk command and return the UUID using the blkid command). After changing /etc/fstab (if required), run update-grub as the root user. Install the Hystax source agent ( hlragent ) as per instructions given on the Hystax Acura server (Web UI). Reboot the Ubuntu instance. At this point the Ubuntu instance is ready to be replicated and migrated. Migrating Centos/RHEL workloads You may encounter an issue where the instance fails to boot in the cloud site after migration, and instead enters a dracut debug state. In this the case, in the source instance, run dracut -fMa qemu . Replicate and re-run the migration and the issue should be resolved. Migrating Microsoft Windows workloads Error when creating and running a migration plan in the Acura user interface When creating and running a migration plan in the Acura user interface, you may encounter an error relating to a malformed mac-address. To resolve this go to the Expert tab in the Edit Migration Plan interface and remove any lines that contain \"\"mac\": \"…..\" . After doing this save and re-run the migration plan and the issue will be resolved. User management When a Microsoft Windows instance is migrated and first created on the destination cloud, the administrator user password will be reset to a random different value. Before a migration is run, ensure the source server has a local user with sufficient administration privileges that enable you to login and administer the server (possibly change the administrator password back if required).

    "title": "How to use Octavia Load Balancing as a Service on UKCloud for OpenStack",
    "keywords": "How to use Octavia Load Balancing as a Service on UKCloud for OpenStack Note This article does not apply to OpenStack regions running OpenStack Platform 10 (OSP10) and lower (currently COR00005). Overview Octavia is the OpenStack Load Balancing as a Service (LBaaS) solution and forms part of the solution for availability and scaling that modern systems require. Octavia currently supports a number of configurations: TCP, HTTP, HTTPS, terminated HTTP and UDP support Source IP, round robin and least connections balancing Health monitoring using ping, HTTP, TLS Hello and UDP Prerequisites If you intend to manage with the OpenStackCLI, you should consider the following: Octavia uses port 13876 for communication. This port will need to be open to manage Octavia. You must be using a recent version of the OpenStackCLI. Use cases Use cases for Octavia include: Scaling out website traffic by balancing it over multiple servers Increasing the availability of a service with active-standby or active-active pools Octavia components Octavia consists of a number of service components that need to be configured as follows: Load balancer. The load balancer sits at the top of the Octavia component stack. The Octavia load balancer connects to an OpenStack network and provides the entry point for traffic. You may assign a load balancer a floating IP to connect it to internet traffic. Listener. An Octavia listener defines an IP protocol and service that the load balancer will accept. This can be TCP, UDP, HTTP or HTTPS (direct or terminated). Each load balancer may have multiple listeners to support more than one service (for example, HTTP and HTTPS). Pool. An Octavia pool defines a list of servers that will accept the traffic from the listener. As with the listener, you select the protocol for the pool to use. Member. Each Octavia pool needs to contain a number of members. These specify the IP address and port of the servers (or services) that will be used to service the requests. You can also define a separate monitoring IP and port distinct from the request ones if needed. Health monitor. The health monitor defines how Octavia can check that the member resources are online and available, automatically removing or re-adding from the list of members in a pool should it be required. The type of check performed is configurable, as is the frequency of checks, timeout and number of failed (or successful) checks required for the status of a member to be changed. Examples Assumptions You must create an HTTP load balancer across existing servers. For this example you'll need: An existing OpenStack router An existing OpenStack network and subnet Two servers providing HTTP over port 80 (the servers must respond to a request for /monitor.html with a valid page) CLI example Create a load balancer openstack loadbalancer create --name \"my-lbaas\" --vip-network-id NETWORK-ID-STRING +---------------------+--------------------------------------+ | Field | Value | +---------------------+--------------------------------------+ | admin_state_up | True | | availability_zone | | | created_at | 2021-07-29T09:13:40 | | description | | | flavor_id | None | | id | 5e815730-8cde-4d31-8761-f50422767c49 | | listeners | | | name | my-lbaas | | operating_status | OFFLINE | | pools | | .... | vip_port_id | fa434d5d-ccd7-462a-920d-9c284420a57c | Create a listener openstack loadbalancer listener create --name \"my-lbaas-listener-http\" --protocol HTTP --protocol-port 80 5e815730-8cde-4d31-8761-f50422767c49 +-----------------------------+--------------------------------------+ | Field | Value | +-----------------------------+--------------------------------------+ | admin_state_up | True | | connection_limit | -1 | | created_at | 2021-07-29T09:17:01 | | default_pool_id | None | | default_tls_container_ref | None | | description | | | id | 20f6ceda-b77f-433f-b171-fbc93668c536 | | insert_headers | None | | l7policies | | | loadbalancers | 5e815730-8cde-4d31-8761-f50422767c49 | | name | my-lbaas-listener-http | Create a pool openstack loadbalancer pool create --name \"my-lbaas-pool-http\" --protocol HTTP --listener 20f6ceda-b77f-433f-b171-fbc93668c536 --lb-algorithm ROUND_ROBIN +----------------------+--------------------------------------+ | Field | Value | +----------------------+--------------------------------------+ | admin_state_up | True | | created_at | 2021-07-29T10:23:56 | | description | | | healthmonitor_id | | | id | 0ca45218-23a5-44f3-8de5-50cd7984ae4d | | lb_algorithm | ROUND_ROBIN | | listeners | 20f6ceda-b77f-433f-b171-fbc93668c536 | | loadbalancers | 5e815730-8cde-4d31-8761-f50422767c49 | | members | | | name | my-lbaas-pool-http | Add two members to the pool openstack loadbalancer member create --name \"my-lbaas-member-1\" --address 10.1.1.134 --protocol-port 80 0ca45218-23a5-44f3-8de5-50cd7984ae4d +---------------------+--------------------------------------+ | Field | Value | +---------------------+--------------------------------------+ | address | 10.1.1.134 | | admin_state_up | True | | created_at | 2021-07-29T10:27:20 | | id | e6cd5dc2-b44a-440e-bae0-45dfa1cd9490 | | name | my-lbaas-member-1 | openstack loadbalancer member create --name \"my-lbaas-member-2\" --address 10.1.1.58 --protocol-port 80 0ca45218-23a5-44f3-8de5-50cd7984ae4d +---------------------+--------------------------------------+ | Field | Value | +---------------------+--------------------------------------+ | address | 10.1.1.58 | | admin_state_up | True | | created_at | 2021-07-29T10:27:54 | | id | b835edce-8157-4802-bce2-33817cf9354f | | name | my-lbaas-member-2 | Create a health monitor openstack loadbalancer healthmonitor create --name \"my-lbaas-monitor\" --http-method GET --type HTTP --url-path /monitor.html --delay 5 --timeout 5 --max-retries 3 0ca45218-23a5-44f3-8de5-50cd7984ae4d +---------------------+--------------------------------------+ | Field | Value | +---------------------+--------------------------------------+ | project_id | 665575955ea34177bb9f7105bcc9782d | | name | my-lbaas-monitor | | admin_state_up | True | | pools | 0ca45218-23a5-44f3-8de5-50cd7984ae4d | | created_at | 2021-07-29T10:32:15 | | provisioning_status | PENDING_CREATE | | updated_at | None | | delay | 5 | | expected_codes | 200 | | max_retries | 3 | | http_method | GET | | timeout | 5 | | max_retries_down | 3 | | url_path | /monitor.html | | type | HTTP | | id | d7007382-43e1-40d2-9439-ebd9b0418931 | Assign a floating IP If you need to, allocate a Floating IP from a network with openstack floating ip create NETWORK-ID-STRING Assign the Floating IP to the Load Balancer VIP port openstack floating ip set --port LOAD-BALANCER-VIP-PORT-ID FLOATING-IP-ID Horizon example Create a load balancer Create a listener Create a pool Add two members to the pool Note For each member you add, click > next to the IP address to open up the monitor details and enter the IP address and port for the health monitor to use (which may be the same details as the member IP and port).

    "keywords": "How to use TrilioVault for self-service backup in OpenStack Overview TrilioVault is a tenant-driven Data Protection-as-a-Service (DPaaS) solution for OpenStack clouds. The TrilioVault solution takes point-in-time backup of workloads and supports multiple recovery options to recover your workloads in case of any outages. This article provides detailed instructions from the [TrilioVault Administration Guide] on the system administration tasks relevant to UKCloud for OpenStack. The target audience of the TrilioVault are OpenStack tenants as well as OpenStack Administrators who are proficient with basic backup and recovery concepts. Benefits of this solution include: Provides backup and disaster recovery solution for OpenStack. Provides multi-tenant, self-service and policy based solution. Provides point-in-time backup of data and configuration. Provides one-click seamless recovery. Provides the flexibility of selectively restoring instances on to same or different networks, different availability zones, regions or different clouds. Provides the flexibility of recovering backups on to different clouds. Recovery either a single file or a directory either through a web portal or ssh In-place restoring a volume or an instance Search for files in list of snapshots Results in reducing Total Cost of Operation (TCO) with excellent Return on Investment (ROI). Understanding Concepts Before starting to use TrilioVault, it is necessary to know a few commonly used concepts in TrilioVault. Below are some of the important terms in OpenStack and TrilioVault. Getting Started If you are currently using an SSO-enabled account to access the OpenStack platform and you want to make use of the TrilioVault service, raise a support ticket and request a Keystone account for Trilio management. TrilioVault Dashboard TrilioVault dashboard is a plug-in into horizon dashboard and allows a user to create and manage backup jobs. A dashboard is a self-managed portal to schedule and execute on-demand backups of workloads. Instances Instances are the running virtual machines within an OpenStack cloud. In the context of TrilioVault, instances are members of workloads (backup-jobs). TrilioVault takes the backup of those OpenStack Instances which are members of the workloads. Workload A workload is defined as a collection of instances, the interconnectivity between them, the virtual disks mapped to those machines and any metadata associated with each of these resources. The tenant can add or remove instances to/from a workload. An instance can only be a member of a single workload at any given time. If a tenant wants to move an instance from one workload to another, the instance first need to be removed from old workload and then add to the new workload. Workload Policy Workload policy defines various aspects of the backup process including number of backups to retain, frequency at which backups are taken and full backups between incrementals. Snapshot A snapshot is the actual copy of the data backup stored in some storage designated as backup store or respository. A snapshot can also be defined as a state of a system at a particular point-in-time. TrilioVault provides its users with the ability to take full and incremental snapshots. A Full type snapshot takes a complete backup of all instances included in the workload independent of previous snapshots. In an Incremental type snapshot, TrilioVault takes backups of only data modified since the last snapshot. Backup target Backup target is the storage repository where TrilioVault keeps its backup data. Restore Restore operation recreates a selected snapshot. TrilioVault supports multiple restore options for user to choose from. One-click restore One-click restore restores the selected snapshot to the exact location including the same network/subnet, volume types, security groups, IP addresses and so on. One-click Restore only works when original instances are deleted. Selective Restore The selective restore method provides a significant amount of flexibility to recover instances. With the selective restore, user can choose different target networks, target volume types, include/exclude specific instances to restore, and target flavor for each instance, etc. In-place restore One click and selective restores creates brand new resources when restoring virtual resources from the backup media. In some cases it is not desirable to construct new resources. Instead user may want to restore an existing volume to a particular point in time. In-place restore functionality will overwrite existing volume with the data from the backup media. Managing Workloads TrilioVault can be accessed via you OpenStack Horizon dashboard from within the Backups --> Workloads menu. An example of TrilioVault's user interface is displayed in Figure 2: TrilioVault Dashboard, and is described in Tables 3 and 4. Figure 2: TrilioVault Dashboard. Table 3: Panels in the TrilioVault Dialog Box. Fields Description Top Panel Displays the OpenStack logo, the project you are logged into, and the role. Left Panel Displays the various menu items, along with description. Right Panel Displays the information about the menu selected in the Left Panel. Table 4: Fields and Descriptions of Menus in TrilioVault. Menu Description Project Lists the Manage Compute and Other sub-menu items. Manage Compute lists the following options. Overview Instances Volumes Images Access & Security Other menu lists the following submenu Backups Admin Lists the System sub-menu items. Overview – By default, the overview screen is displayed on the right hand section Hypervisors Instances Volumes Flavors Image Defaults System Information Backups This panel is provided by the TrilioVault plugin. It is listed under the Project menu. All the above tabs are inherited from the OpenStack dashboard. Here a user can create and manage his/her backup jobs. Creating a Workload A workload can be of two types: Serial Workload: When the selected workload type is Serial, TrilioVault executes the snapshot process of instances in the workload successively in the order they were added to the workload. Parallel Workload: When the selected workload type is Parallel, TrilioVault executes the snapshot operation of instances in the workload in arbitrary order. Workload policy is an admin defined policy template. Cloud administrator defines these policy templates and makes them available for tenants. Each policy defines various aspects of the backup job including snapshot retention, snapshot interval etc. When one or more policies are assigned to a tenant, tenant can only choose one of those policies for their workloads. To create workload, follow the steps. Click Project from the left panel. Navigate to Backups then click Create Workload. The Create Workload screen is displayed as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3: Create Workload. Select the desired values as explained in the following table: Field Name Description Details tab Refer to Figure 3 for details. Workload Name Enter the name of the workload to be created. Workload Description Enter brief description. Workload Type Select either Serial or Parallel. Workload Policy Cloud Administrator defined workload policies to choose from. Workload Members tab Refer to Figure 7 for details. Instance checkbox Add the instances for your workload. Policy tab Refer to Figure 13 for details. Enabled This checkbox is selected by default. If it is deselected, Start Date, End Date, Start Time, Repeat Every cannot be entered. Start Date The date on which backup process will start. It is in mm/dd/yyyy format and the default value is always Today’s date. End Date The date until which the backup process will take place. It is in mm/dd/yyyy format and the default value is always No End Date. Start Time The time when the backup process will begin. It has to be in the format hh:mm AM/PM. The default value is 09:00 PM UTC. Repeat Every The time interval in which the backup process will be repeated, for example, repeat every hour/day/week. It has to be in format 24 hrs, or 1 Day, or 1 week. The default value is 24 hrs. Snapshot Retention Type Can be either a Number of Snapshots to keep or Number of days to retain Snapshots. Snapshot Retention Value Depending upon the Snapshot Retention Type, enter the value of Snapshot Retention Type. The default value is 30. For example, if the type is a Number of Snapshots to keep, the system will keep the last 30 snapshots and if the type is Number of days to retain Snapshots, then the Snapshots for the last 30 days will be retained. All other snapshots will be deleted. Full Backup Interval Frequency at which Full Backup should be taken. The options are: Never (The default value selected is Never). Always (Value 0 means Always). No. of Days (Number of incremental snapshots to take full backup between 1 and 999). If this option is selected, enter the number provided in the text box. Pause at Snapshot TrilioVault will pause guest instances while snapshotting them, otherwise not. The default setting is not to pause the VM. Click Create. The created workload will be seen listed the Workload Types in Backups under Project menu as shown in Figure 4. Figure 4: Serial/Parallel Workload Created. Edit Workload Edit Workload allows user to change the workload name or workload details. The following steps show how an existing workload can be modified.

Retention Policy Number of snapshots to keep - Displays the number of snapshots to be retained. Number of Days to Retain - Displays the number of days to retain a snapshot. Workload Policy Template TrilioVault 2.6 has introduced a new concept called workload policy template. The template defines attributes of an SLA. For example, a business critical application may have stringent SLA with hourly backups and 100 snapshots to retain. Cloud administrator can define a policy template that captures this SLA and publish it to tenants. Policy template feature also gives cloud administrator more control over what backup policies that tenants can choose for their applications. From workflow point of view policy template is very similar to nova flavors where nova flavors are defined by cloud administrator and tenants are only limited to those flavors when creating instances. With workload policy templates, cloud administrator creates various templates and publishes to tenants and tenants are limited to only those policy templates that they are assigned. However, workload policy template is not automatically assigned to each tenant. Cloud administrator should assign each template selectively to a tenant. If a tenant is not assigned any template, that tenant has the freedom to choose/define the backup policy based on Configuring a Scheduling Policy Managing Snapshots Taking a Snapshot TrilioVault creates a snapshot of the workload automatically as per the policy settings created as described in Policy Configurations. A snapshot can also be executed manually (on demand). To create a snapshot for a workload, follow these steps. Navigate to Backups and click Workload. Click Create Snapshot corresponding to the workload for which snapshot is to be created as shown in Figure 15. Figure 15: Creating snapshot for Workload. A new Create Snapshot window is displayed as shown in Figure 16. Figure 16: Create Full/Incremental Snapshot. Create Snapshot in Table 7 gives the description of the Create Snapshot window. Table 7: Create Snapshot. Field name Description Snapshot Name Name of the snapshot. Snapshot Description Description of the snapshot to be created. Snapshot Type Type of snapshot Full or Incremental. The default value is Incremental. Full Snapshot To create a full snapshot follow these steps. Click Create Snapshot corresponding to the workload for which snapshot is to be created. Enter Snapshot details like Snapshot Name, Snapshot Description and Snapshot Type as Full. Click Create. Click WORKLOAD NAME , click Snapshot tab. The created snapshot can be seen as displayed in Figure 17. Figure 17: Full Snapshot Creation. Incremental Snapshot Note During the creation of an incremental snapshot, TrilioVault creates a temporary volume which is cleared after the snapshot has been completed. An Incremental snapshot is the backup of the latest changes since the last backup. When a recovery is needed, the restoration process would need the last full backup plus all the incremental backups until the point-in-time of the restoration. Incremental backups require minimum storage space and are quick to perform. To create incremental snapshot follow these steps. Click Create Snapshot corresponding to the workload for which the snapshot is to be created. Enter the Snapshot details like Snapshot Name, Snapshot Description and Snapshot Type as Incremental. Click Create. Click WORKLOAD NAME , click Snapshot tab. The created snapshot can be seen as displayed in Figure 18. Figure 18: Incremental Snapshot Creation.

Mount a Snapshot TrilioVault allows you to view or download a file from the snapshot. Any changes to the files or directories when a snapshot is mounted are temporary and are discarded when the snapshot is unmounted. Mounting is a faster way to restore a single or multiple files. To mount a snapshot follow these steps. TrilioVault ships with a ubuntu based file manager image. This image includes a web based file manager application that helps with browsing and download files when snapshot is mounted. Before you create a File Manager instance, File Manager (a.k.a Recovery Manager) image needs to be uploaded to the Glance. The cloud administrator can upload the image to Glance and mark the image public so that every tenant will have access to the image. File Manager image includes a qemu guest agent. TrilioVault data mover communicates with the qemu agent to map backup images and discover file systems in the backup images. Since the file manager image includes qemu guest agent, the image should be uploaded to glance with property hw_qemu_guest_agent=yes so Nova will create a qmp channel when creating an instance from this image. TrilioVault horizon plugin uses a special property tvault_recovery_manager, when set to yes it will filter out instances that don’t have this property. If a tenant has a huge number of instances, setting this property on the image will help TrilioVault horizon plug-in present only the instances whose image has this property. In this release we only support launching File Manager instance with virtio bus so please set hw_disk_bus to virtio. Use the following command to upload the image to Glance and mark it as public image and set the property. glance image-create --name tvault-file-manager \\ --file <File Manager Image Path> \\ --container-format bare --disk-format qcow2 \\ --progress --is-public=True \\ --property hw_qemu_guest_agent=yes \\ --property tvault_recovery_manager=yes \\ --property hw_disk_bus=virtio Once the image is successfully loaded, a tenant can instantiate file manager instance as described below. Launch the File Manager Instance. Refer to Figure 25 for details. Figure 25: Launch File Manager Instance. Assign Security Group to open port 80 Associate a floating IP to the launched instance. To mount a snapshot, login to TrilioVault and Navigate to Backups. Click WORKLOAD NAME , then click Snapshots tab. Click More drop-down, then click Mount Snapshot. Refer to Figure 26 for details. Figure 26: Mounting Snapshot. Assign the File Manager instance to the snapshot launched in Step 1. Refer to Figure 27 for details. Click Mount. Figure 27: Assigning File Manager Instance to snapshot. Access File Manager using FLOATING IP created in step 3. Refer to Figure 28 for details. Figure 28: File Manager. Select the preferred action and double-click the selected action. Figure 29: File Manager Options. The web-interface displays 5 options as shown in Figure 29. Table 14: File Manager Options. Option Description Parent Folder Allows end user to go back to parent folder of the selected file. Download Allows end user to download the file. Rename Allows end user to rename the file. (The change is local. It won’t change the backup copy.) Delete Allows end user to delete the file. (This change is local. It won’t change the backup copy.) Replace file Allows end user to replace the file with another file. (The change is local. It won’t change the backup copy.) Choose appropriate action. File manager instance contains the metadata that describes what snapshot is currently mounted. In-place restore of a file/directory The previous section explained how to recover a file or directory from a backup by using the snapshot mount command. However, the web portal based file/directory retrieval is cumbersome and is not very friendly for scripting. With this release, the TrilioVault Recovery Manager image is shipped with cloud-init functionality so you can instantiate the recovery manager instance with a key-pair so you can do a password-less ssh session to recovery manager instance. To do an in-place restore of files or directories, the user first performs a snapshot-mount operation on a backup image and uses the recovery manager instance. Once this operation is completed successfully, the user can mount snapshot VM images using sshfs command as shown in the following figure. sshfs ubuntu@172.24.4.4:/home/ubuntu/tvault-mounts/mounts mnt In the above example, 172.24.4.4 is the floating IP address of recovery manager instance. mnt is the mount point. The mnt point can be browsed for VM images/file systems using standard Linux tools and copy required files. Note sshfs-based mount operation is still subjected to standard Linux user permissions. For example a file that is owned by root and does not have read permissions to ssh user may not be copied Unmount a Snapshot Snapshot can be unmounted when access to individual files/directories are no longer needed. To unmount the snapshot, follow these steps. To unmount a snapshot, login to Horizon dashboard and navigate to Backups. Click WORKLOAD NAME , then click Snapshots tab. Click Unmount Snapshot as shown in Figure 30. Figure 30: Unmount Snapshot. On confirming the Unmount Snapshot action, TrilioVault will unmount the snapshot. Refer to Figure 31 for details. Figure 31: Confirm Unmount. The snapshot gets unmounted successfully. Refer to Figure 32 for details. Figure 32: Snapshot Unmounted. Sometimes it becomes daunting to find the snapshot that is mounted, in particular when there are many workloads and many snapshots. When a snapshot is mounted, the file manager instance metadata includes the snapshot ID that is currently mounted with the file manager. Please see the following screen grab from the file manager instance details. Figure 33: File Manager instance metadata with mounted snapshot id. Restore a Workload Snapshot To return the workload instances to their original state, a snapshot must be restored. When a snapshot is restored, it recreates the original workload instances in the exact same state as they were in, when the snapshot was taken. A single snapshot can be restored any number of times and the existing snapshots continue to be valid even after restoring any snapshots from the list. A snapshot can be restored in three ways. One-click Restore Selective Restore In-place Restore One-click Restore One-click Restore is a single click restore of the snapshot irrespective of the size of the snapshot. The snapshot may include multiple instances, networks or Cinder volumes. One-click is a convenient way of reverting an application to a predetermined point in time. For One-click Restore to succeed, the user needs to make sure that the original workload instances are deleted before triggering the restore operation. This method will restore the selected snapshot to the exact same location same tenant, network, volume types, and so on. To restore a snapshot with One-click, follow these steps. Delete all original workload instances from the OpenStack cloud as shown in Figure 34. The Instances display the deleted workload instances. Figure 34: VM(s) to be Deleted. Login to Horizon dashboard and navigate to Backups. Click WORKLOAD NAME , and then click Snapshots tab. Click One-click Restore menu option of the corresponding snapshot as shows in Figure 35. Figure 35: Snapshot Selected for One-click Restore. One-click Restore screen as shown in Figure 36 is displayed. Figure 36: One-click Restore. Enter the details OneClickRestore Name and OneClickRestore Description. Click Restore. It will restore all the workload instances at the same location with the same settings on OpenStack as shown in Figure 37. Figure 37: One-click Restore in progress. Selective Restore Selective Restore allows for lot of flexibility to recover instances. With the Selective Restore method, end user can choose the target network, target volume types, include/exclude instances to restore, and change target flavor for each VM. instances will get restored as per the end user’s choice. For example, if a tenant would like to restore only selected instances and not all of the workload instances, then the tenant can do that using Selective Restore. Unlike the One-click Restore method, an end user does not need to delete the original workload instances to perform the selective restore operation. To proceed with Selective Restore, follow these steps. Login to Horizon and Navigate to Backups. Click WORKLOAD NAME , then click Snapshots tab. Click Selective Restore as shown in Figure 38. Figure 38: Snapshot Selected for Selective Restore. Selective Restore screen will be displayed as shown in Figure 39. Figure 39: Selective Restore Details. Enter the details and navigate to the Network Mapping tab. Refer to Figure 40 for details. Select the target network you want to restore the snapshot to. Figure 40: Selective Restore-Network Mapping. Navigate to Volume Types Mapping tab and select the target volume type you want to restore to, as shown in Figure 41. Figure 41: Selective Restore-Volume Types Mapping. Each of the subsequent tabs correspond to workload instances created. There is a separate tab for each VM. Using these tabs you can edit restore settings of the respective VM. Select an instance’s tab. You will see options to choose to include/exclude that VM from restore, flavor type, and instance name. Deselect the checkbox if you do not want to include that particular VM in the restore process as shown in Figure 42. Figure 42: Selective Restore-VM not included in Restore. Select Flavor, Enter Instance Name. Instance Name if changed will restore the instance with the new name. Click Restore. It will restore all the workload instances on OpenStack as shown in Figure 43. In the figure the restored VM in target IP can be seen. Figure 43: Selective Restore instances. In-place restore Both OneClick Restore and Selective Restore create brand new resources as part of the restore process. In some cases, it is not desirable to create new resources. For example, an instance may have an application data residing on a Cinder volume and user only wanted to restore Cinder volume but leave the rest of the VM intact. In-Place Restore allows users to restore selected volume without the need to recreate the whole instance. In-Place restore was introduced in TrilioVault version 2.4. Figure 44 In-place Restore Menu Item. The current release added a new menu item called In-place Restore which opens a new dialog. Figure 45 In-place Restore Wizard. Figure 46 Choice of resources to restore. File Search Another important introduced in 2.4 release is the ability to search for a file or list of files within a selected list of snapshots. TrilioVault takes image level backups, yet it provides file level/directory level recovery. However, if a user doesn’t know the latest snapshot where the desired file may reside, it is a painful process to mount numerous snapshots and look for the file. With file search feature, user can quickly find the list of snapshots that the file exists. File Search feature tab is added to workload details page as show below. Your workload may have more than one VM. First select the VM and then choose the file path. File path may include wildcards which allows listing of files within a directory. For example if you want to search all files with in/var/log/ directory, you can provide a search path /var/log/*. By default, it searches all the snapshots available for the workload. TrilioVault file search feature directly searches the backup images. TrilioVault backup images are fully formed and are instantly accessible without the need to restore backup images. TrilioVault leverage this ability to search files and directories on the backup image itself. Though this process appears little slow compared to using some index based solutions, our file search is radically simple and easy to maintain. Also, if you were to transfer a workload from one cloud to another cloud, you can still search backup images in the new cloud. Though it supports multiple snapshots search facility, the search slows down if the number of snapshots in the search increases. Our file search facility provides various filters to narrow down the list of snapshots. From the list of snapshots in the table, user can deselect any snapshots from search. User can also narrow the search by latest number snapshots or by time range. Once user clicks ‘Search’, the results are displayed in a format that looks like ls –la . Restore Details To obtain Restore details information, follow these steps. Using Horizon dashboard, navigate to Backups. Click WORKLOAD NAME on the Workload Details screen. Navigate to the Snapshots tab and click the name of snapshot. The screen as shown in Figure 47 is displayed. Figure 47: Snapshot Details. Navigate to the Restore tab and click RESTORE NAME .

    "title": "OpenStack live migrations",
    "keywords": "OpenStack live migrations Overview OpenStack utilises virtualisation technology where several virtual instances (sometimes also known as virtual machines or VMs) run on physical servers. These physical servers run software that enables them to be hypervisors, allowing them to run many virtual servers. For a more detailed description of virtualisation, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization . Many other resources exist on the internet explaining the concept of virtualisation. Planning maintenance activity When performing maintenance activity on a hypervisor server, it's best practice to migrate all the instances running on that server to another one so the activities on the server being worked on don't affect those instances. After this migration process, the instances that were running on the original hypervisor server will now be running on a different server. Within each OpenStack region on the UKCloud platform, we have several hypervisor servers providing the UKCloud for OpenStack service. The process of live migration moves a running instance seamlessly from one hypervisor server to another, meaning that the instances can continue running without any interruption to service. When all the instances have been moved onto different hypervisor servers, then maintenance can take place on the original hypervisor server safely (including reboot of the physical server, and so on). The act of performing the live migration may slow down an instance's performance during the period when it is being migrated due to the need to copy the data on the instance to another hypervisor server. In some types of virtualisation environment, and depending on configurations, it's possible for instances to migrate themselves to other servers, but in OpenStack this has to be done manually by an administrator (UKCloud employee) in the region.

Full pricing with all options, including licensing and connectivity, is available in the UKCloud Pricing Guide . Instances Instance pricing is based on a minimum billing period of one hour and depends on the choice of: Instance flavour Security domain Each service has a per-unit price. Billing is per unit. Persistent block storage Persistent block storage cost is based on the average storage provisioned by the customer at the end of the month, which is based on daily average measurements. In addition, our Cloud Storage service is available to provide an API-accessible and S3-compatible object storage solution that complements your OpenStack environment. For full details, see the Cloud Storage Service Definition . Self-service backup and restoration TrilioVault provides data protection through efficient point-in-time capture, storage and application recovery. TrilioVault is a scalable OpenStack backup and recovery platform that can recover from any point-in-time with a single click usign the Horizon dashboard or leveraging Trilio's rich set of APIs. TrilioVault is agentless and non-disruptive by design, both during deployment and operation. You can also integrate it with your existing cloud lifecycle management to automate deployment via tools such as Ansible, Puppet, Salt and Chef. Licensing The standard terms and conditions from Microsoft state that if you want to run a Windows Server operating system in the cloud, you must license it via the Service Provider Licence Agreement (SPLA), which must be provided by UKCloud. Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) and Windows desktop operating system licences are generally not permitted by Microsoft's terms and conditions. UKCloud offers the option for you to bring your own Red Hat licensing, or certain Microsoft application licensing under Microsoft Mobility using software assurance. If you're licensing Microsoft Windows Server OS, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft RDS or Red Hat Enterprise Linux, licensing charges apply. You also have the option of utilising your own subscription-based Office365 and Windows 10 Enterprise licensing under the QMTH program . Pricing example An application with lower priority workloads, such as temporary applications, data processing or system modelling tasks. Security domain: Assured OFFICIAL Instance flavour: 1 t1.small instance Persistent block storage used: 60GiB Tier 2 block storage TrilioVault: Yes Operating system: Red Hat Enterprise Linux Instance cost per month A t1.small instance in the Assured OFFICIAL security domain costs £0.030 per hour. Red Hat Enterprise Linux OS licensing for a t1.small instance costs £0.040 per hour. In an average 730 hour month, the monthly instance cost works out at: Hours in operation x (Instance + Licensing) = Instance cost per month 730 x (£0.030 + £0.040) = £51.10 Storage cost per month Tier 2 persistent block storage costs £0.10 per GiB month, so the storage cost for 60GiB is £6.00 . Backup cost per month To protect a single instance, TrilioVault costs £12.00 per instance and £0.10 per GiB per month. Monthly subscription + Storage cost = Backup cost per month (1 x £12.00) + (60 x £0.10) = £18.00 Total basic cost Calculate the total basic cost by adding together the monthly instance, storage and backup costs. Instance cost per month + Storage cost per month + Backup cost per month = Total basic cost £51.10 + £6.00 + £18.00 = £75.10 Discount options The following discount and purchase schemes are available with UKCloud for VMware: Commitment discount Annual subscription discount Cloud Credits For more information about the discount and purchase schemes offered by UKCloud, see the UKCloud Pricing Guide . Additional pricing notes Shelving instances You can shelve an instance, at which stage all compute charges for the instance will cease and you are only charged at the prevailing rate for the storage the instance was consuming. For all other states, UKCloud will continue to charge for any resources that exist within your OpenStack project. Licensing SQL Standard is charged per hour based on the powered-on state of the host VM. SQL Enterprise is charged monthly. You must report, via support ticket, which VMs have either SQL Standard or Enterprise installed so that we can license and bill you accordingly. You do have the option to bring your own licences for SQL under Microsoft Mobility, though you must inform us as soon as you receive confirmation from Microsoft that mobility has been agreed.

Microsoft Windows Server licences must be provided by UKCloud and you'll be billed per hour based on the powered-on state of the host VM. If you want to host Oracle solutions on our platform, consult our Cloud Architects, or consider our Dedicated Compute v2 or Private Cloud for Oracle Software services to avoid licensing issues. Snapshots You will only ever be charged for the amount of Tier 1 or Tier 2 storage your snapshots consume, that you have scheduled via the OpenStack dashboard or the API. We do not place any additional premium on top for the snapshot functionality. To calculate an estimated cost of performing snapshots on UKCloud for OpenStack, use the following formula: Cost £ = Instance size (GiB) x Number of snapshots to be retained (customer controlled) x Choice of storage (Tier 1 or Tier 2) For example, if a customer has an 80GiB Tier 2 instance and performs a snapshot every hour, but only wants to keep the current snapshot, plus the last nine snapshots then: 80 GiB x 10 snapshots x £0.10 = £80 per month Billing and payment information Billing for the service is one month in arrears. The minimum unit of time for use is one hour. Part hours will be rounded up. Payment can be made by direct bank transfer. You can find bank details for payment on your invoice. Billing information is provided in an evidence file on the first working day of the month for your previous month's spend. For more information about the invoice evidence file, see Understanding your invoice evidence file . You can also query the OpenStack Ceilometer API to query live event data. Termination fees There are no termination fees for the service. You are responsible for extracting your own data from the platform if required.

To get you started quickly, we publish a public catalog on our platform that provides several instance images for commonly-used instance sizes and operating systems. Image versioning We update our supported images once a quarter. We will not remove images from the platform until they are no longer in use by any customer. UKCloud always recommends using the latest available image, and recommends that all instances have their packages updated as often as possible. Image naming convention Within the public catalog, we use the following image naming convention to enable you to easily identify images and select the best image to meet your requirements: <distributionName>-<distributionVersionNumber>-CURRENT - This will be the most recent image for the quarter. <distributionName>-<distributionVersionNumber>-<DATE> - The date indicates when the image was rotated from being the current image.

    "title": "How the UKCloud OpenStack platform outperforms hyperscalers",
    "keywords": "How the UKCloud OpenStack platform outperforms hyperscalers The evolution of UKCloud UKCloud has long been known for its VMware powered UKCloud for VMware service, which has enabled hundreds of UK Public Sector workloads to be moved to the cloud. In response to increasing demand from customers creating genuine cloud native (12-Factor) applications, we have developed and launched our UKCloud for OpenStack service, powered by OpenStack – the leading open-source alternative to the proprietary global public cloud platforms. The OpenStack service that is available today has been vastly improved in terms of reliability, functionality and performance. Although there are several cloud providers available to the UK Public Sector, UKCloud maintains its position as the number one choice for security assured citizen-facing services with UK data centres and UK-based security cleared staff. There are several factors to consider when choosing a cloud provider, such as price, performance, reliability, suitability for workloads, sovereignty and assurance. Value for money will often be at the forefront of the decision-making process. However, at UKCloud we are competitive on more than just price and believe performance is an important metric to consider. This document will concentrate on performance benchmarking and introduces a comparison of performance on our OpenStack platform against other public cloud providers. Based on our innovative, next generation infrastructure Our OpenStack platform is deployed on our innovative, next generation infrastructure. Rather than a SAN-based converged infrastructure, our next generation infrastructure is built on commodity hardware and leverages software defined data centre (SDDC) technology including software defined networking (Cisco ACI and OpenStack Neutron) and software defined storage (Red Hat Ceph). This new infrastructure is designed to deliver much greater levels of scalability via multiple fault domains to improve availability and resilience. As bottlenecks such as the storage array and network functions are replaced with highly distributed resources, the new infrastructure is designed to deliver much greater levels of performance compared with our previous infrastructure. Why does performance matter? These results are important for several reasons: Cost control – the superior performance of the UKCloud platform means that you can do more with less. To match our performance using the public cloud providers, you would need bigger instances, more instances or both – significantly increasing the cost of those platforms. A platform that appears 20% cheaper but has half the performance may mean you end up paying 60% more for the same performance. Developer productivity – our OpenStack platform has been designed specifically for agile software development projects where there is a real demand for environments to be provisioned rapidly and destroyed when no longer needed. Superior performance means that pipeline automation happens quickly and reliably so your developers aren't blocked waiting for the infrastructure to be ready. User experience – as digital systems are increasingly used directly by millions of potential users (for example, citizens), it's important that your platform can deliver superior performance when your users need it. Our approach to benchmarking To validate the performance of our platform, UKCloud has been running automated tests to compare the performance of UKCloud for OpenStack against two leading proprietary public cloud platforms, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. The benchmarking was based on the PerfKit Benchmarker tool which was originally developed by Google and made available to the open-source community. PerfKit is designed to provide a repeatable, consistent and open way of measuring cloud performance. PerfKit was configured to specifically compare the UKCloud Region 5, Zone C UKCloud for OpenStack platform with AWS EU-West 2 (London) region and the Azure London region. The benchmarks ran throughout August 2017 and average values for the month are reported below. Benchmark results UKCloud performed a suite of tests to assess the performance of various components of the platform, as well as some end-to-end system tests. The following pages provide more detail regarding each of the benchmark results. Note For the graphs shown in this document, apart from instance boot time where a lower result is better, a higher result indicates superior performance. (UKCloud outperforms both AWS and Azure on 90% of benchmarks performed). Instance boot time Instance boot time refers to the amount of time taken for an instance to boot from a powered off state. The graph below shows that UKCloud instances on the UKCloud for OpenStack platform boot 1.5 times faster than AWS and almost 7 times faster than Azure. This means that you will benefit from reduced delay in loading the instances and the end user is able to quickly access the applications within them. MongoDB MongoDB is an open-source database developed by MongoDB, Inc. Unlike relational databases, it stores data in JSON format that can vary in structure. This data model gives you the ability to represent hierarchical relationships and other complex structures easily. MongoDB was designed with high availability and scalability and therefore includes out-of-the-box replication and auto-scaling. The performance of MongoDB running on the UKCloud for OpenStack platform is 2 times faster than AWS and almost 2 times faster than Azure meaning that MongoDB performs over twice as many operations per second on the UKCloud platform. This results in better database performance with UKCloud and means there is higher data availability to applications, which in turn affects the service that a customer consumes, resulting in a better customer experience. Network performance The networking performance test is a commonly used benchmark that can create TCP and UDP data streams and measures the throughput of a network that is carrying them. The values shown in the graph below indicate the maximum throughput of the respective networks. UKCloud has a maximum throughput almost 12 times higher than AWS and almost 19 times higher than Azure. This is important for customers who are moving large sets of data or need quick access to their data over the network. This results in less time spent waiting for data transfers to be completed, which allows applications to access their data more quickly. Ultimately meaning applications can run faster, giving a better user experience. Random IO performance Random read is a measure of how quickly multiple small files can be read from random areas on a disk. Random read performance is measured in input-output operations per second with the number shown below an indication of the maximum number of reads. Random write uses the same disk pattern as random read but data is written to the disk rather than read. The graph below shows that the UKCloud for OpenStack platform performs over 5 times more random read IOPs than AWS and over 34 times more than Azure. For random write, the UKCloud platform performs over 4 times more IOPs than AWS and over 27 times more than Azure. This means that enterprise applications such as relational databases which are disk-intensive (require high I/O), perform better on the UKCloud platform. Databases and applications that are disk intensive are often slowed down by their storage, hence the increased popularity of Solid State Drives (SSD). However, as the graph below shows, UKCloud provides fast storage access allowing applications to rapidly access and process data, resulting in faster applications compared to AWS and Azure's equivalent storage option. Sequential IO performance Sequential read is a disk access pattern in which large continuous blocks of data are read from adjacent locations on the disk. Sequential write is the same pattern, but data is written to the disk rather than read. These kinds of disk access patterns are common when accessing large multimedia files such as music, video and images. They are also important for data warehouses and analytical applications. The graph below shows that for sequential read the UKCloud platform performs almost 11 times better than AWS and over 5 times better than Azure. For sequential write, the UKCloud platform has a maximum IO over 10 times higher than AWS and over 6 times higher than Azure. As with databases, these kinds of applications are often slowed down by their storage, hence the increased popularity of Solid State Drives (SSD). However, as the graph below shows, UKCloud provides fast storage access allowing applications to rapidly access and process data, resulting in faster applications compared to AWS and Azure's equivalent storage option. High sequential IO performance is vital for data analysis and specifically for data warehouses which are a core component of business intelligence and thus guide key management decisions. Where does the UKCloud OpenStack platform outperform both hyperscalers? The data in the benchmark results section shows that the UKCloud for OpenStack platform consistently outperforms both hyperscalers across a variety of benchmarks including: Instance Boot Time 1.5 times faster than AWS Almost 7 times faster than Azure Reduced delay in loading the instances means that users are able to readily access the applications within them Networking Performance Almost 12 times higher than AWS Almost 19 times higher than Azure Users spend less time transferring data on the network, allowing applications to access their data faster and thus running faster MongoDB 2 times faster than AWS Almost 2 times faster than Azure Better database performance allows for higher data availability to applications, therefore resulting in a better customer experience Random I/O Performance Random Read is over 5 times faster than AWS and over 34 times faster than Azure Random Write is over 4 times faster than AWS and over 27 times faster than Azure Faster storage access allows applications to rapidly access and process data and thus results in faster applications Sequential I/O Performance Sequential Read is almost 11 times better than AWS and over 4 times better than Azure Sequential Write is over 10 times higher than AWS and over 6 times higher than Azure High sequential IO performance is vital for data analysis and specifically for data warehouses, it is a core component of business intelligence and thus guides key management decisions Summary Although a platform may appear cheaper, if it has half the performance this may mean you could end up paying significantly more for the same performance. Using UKCloud's OpenStack platform means that you can do ‘more for less’ as you can save money with simple usage-based billing and benefit from the greater performance the platform offers. While actual performance may vary based upon numerous real-world factors such as internet latency, application-tuning and a minimal risk of multi-tenant contention, we are confident that these benchmark results truly reflect the greater performance that UKCloud for OpenStack delivers over the nearest equivalent region and VM sizes of both AWS and Azure We are continuously investigating ways to improve the performance of our UKCloud for OpenStack platform through using the latest versions of OpenStack, software-defined storage and networking, coupled with adaptive storage and network tuning as the platform is consumed. All of this will reassure our customers that the greater performance delivered today, will remain in the future.

    "keywords": "Self Service Backup and Restoration (TrilioVault) Service Scope General This article explains what is and isn't included in the scope of the OpenStack Self Service Backup and Restoration (TrilioVault) service option. TrilioVault is one of a variety of on-platform protection options available from UKCloud. Use this article to understand instance backup and restoration and whether it will meet your own recovery point (RPO) or recovery time (RTO) objectives. About Self Service Backup and Restoration (TrilioVault) When you opt an OpenStack instance into the TrilioVault service, the instance is added to your TrilioVault self-service dashboard within OpenStack. Backups are made of the entire instance running on your UKCloud for OpenStack service. Data protected by this service has a variable RPO dictated by the frequency of backups scheduled by the end user. RTO is determined by the time taken to restore the backup once you've instantiated it via the OpenStack dashboard. Self Service Backup and Restoration management You can make changes to your Backup and Restoration service directly via the OpenStack dashboard. You can: Opt instances into the service Change the backup policy for an instance Opt instances out of the backup service Instantiate the restoration of entire instances from an existing backup Instantiate the restoration of an individual file from an existing backup Restores As a fully self-service function, customers can invoke their own restorations of either an entire instance or individual files via the OpenStack dashboard. How is Self Service Backup and Restoration (TrilioVault) charged? TrilioVault is chargeable based on the number of instances protected and the capacity utilised to store the data. [!NOTE] The TrilioVault platform leverages cinder snapshots to get the data backed up. It initiates a snapshot for the initial full backup and leaves the snapshot there to use as the differential for the next incremental backup. At any given time, there could be up to two snapshots visible per volume being backed up. At the end of the backup, there should only be one left behind (used for next incremental). In short we would not recommend deleting any TrilioVault snapshots as this will impact upon the performance of your backup routine. How can TrilioVault be used as a Disaster Recovery (DR) tool? By default, TrilioVault is not a DR tool, however in the event UKCloud declares a DR scenario in your primary datacentre, we can repoint TrilioVault to make your backup target site also become the recovery site, ensuring we can restore any and all workloads to a secondary datacentre in the event of a diaster event in your primary datacentre. Frequency and timing As TrilioVault is fully self-service, customers have full control as to the time and frequency that any backups occur. Alerting and reporting Information about your backups is reported via the OpenStack dashboard, where the status of all backup and restoration events can be monitored in real time. Success rate We do not guarantee successful backups, but we provide customers with full visibility as to the status of any backups along with the ability for customers to re-instantiate any backups that fail to complete. Rerun of failed backups The onus is on the customer to monitor the success of their backups via the tools made available within OpenStack. UKCloud will not automatically invoke any reruns of failed backups. What SLA do you offer on snapshot success? TrilioVault backups don't include an SLA. You should be aware that backups may occasionally fail for a variety of reasons. The status of TrilioVault backups should be monitored by the customer via the OpenStack dashboard. This service is not backed by Service Credits. The UKCloud support team can help provide customers with the support around investigating any failures on request. Planned Maintenance On occasion, Planned Maintenance of the OpenStack platform will take precedence over this service. If there's a potential disruption, we'll highlight this to you via the UKCloud Service Status page . Additional data protection services [!NOTE] No protection products are automatically applied to instances running on the UKCloud platform, therefore you must explicitly select the protection option that best meets your requirements. UKCloud for OpenStack also offers self-service snapshot protection natively from within the platform should you not require the advanced features of TrilioVault. If neither of these services meet your requirements, you can also implement and manage your own protection solution. The UKCloud Cloud Storage service may be an appropriate target for self-managed solutions using software such as CommVault or NetWorker.

As Oracle OVM doesn't have a Layer 3 networking function built into the platform, we leverage the VMware cloud and the native NSX Edges to provide external connectivity for Oracle VMs. What technology is UKCloud for Oracle Software based on? For the x86 Oracle service, UKCloud have chosen to utilise Oracle's own Oracle Virtual Machine (OVM) technology to underpin its UKCloud for Oracle Software platform. Current stack is Oracle VM Server-> Oracle VM Manager-> Oracle Enterprise Manager. Which Oracle architectures are suitable for deployment on the UKCloud platform? UKCloud are currently working on a \"known good\" list of architectures that will allow customers to ascertain if UKCloud's platform is suitable for hosting their Oracle workloads. Please engage with a UKCloud solutions architect to see how we can help with your requirements. How can I backup my UKCloud for Oracle Software environment? The UKCloud for Oracle Software platform is based on an underpinning infrastructure that can support native Oracle technologies such as Data Guard and RMAN data protection solutions. If I'm using Oracle Data Guard, will I need to have the same size DR VMs as my primary VMs? No. While you will need to have the same CPU and storage allocation, you can reduce your RAM allocation by 50% in your DR VMs and ramp up if you need to invoke DR. Can I use UKCloud's Mass Data Transfer Facility to import my Oracle data? While this is not currently available, this is being investigated by the development team. Can I have a dedicated UKCloud for Oracle Software environment? Yes. If you prefer a dedicated environment, UKCloud offer the Private Cloud service for both Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL. Alternatively, if you want to use Oracle proprietary hardware, then we can support the hosting and management of certain Oracle technologies - see Private Cloud for Oracle Software for more information. Is the RAM virtual or physical? As with all our services, UKCloud for Oracle Software comes with Virtual RAM. What is the best platform to use to run MySQL? It is based on preference, as Oracle, VMware and OpenStack are all capable of handling the MySQL application. Billing and legal How is it billed? UKCloud for Oracle Software workloads are priced per hour, and your bills are based on the resources that you allocate to your solution. In contrast to traditional hosting models, this ensures there's no lock-in to unnecessarily licensed or under-utilised hardware. You will be billed for the total number of cores, memory and storage consumed during the month which will appear in the following month's invoice. This may also include connectivity and other service options or licensing if they are selected. Licensing of Oracle software above the Operating System will remain your responsibility. UKCloud are not currently able to supply this. Management Is this a managed service? No. UKCloud maintain and manage the underlying infrastructure that your solution is based on, but we do not manage your UKCloud for Oracle Software solution. If you need your solution managed, there are a number of accredited Oracle partners within the UKCloud partner network that will be able to help. Are templates available for solution components? UKCloud will provide a set of base OS templates (assemblies) based on Oracle Linux and Microsoft. You can also create your own assemblies and upload reusable software images. How do I increase or decrease resources? Currently, processor, memory and storage allocations are changed by raising a service request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. This is because of the resource pinning that OVM does on the underlying hypervisor. Processors and memory can be added to or removed from VMs, although VMs will need to be shut down for this to happen. Increasing CPU or memory allocations will result in the VM being billed at a higher rate. Additional VM storage can be allocated and will be billed on a per GiB per month basis. How long will it take to provision the service?- Depending on the complexity of the solution, including the ingress of data onto the UKCloud platform, it can take up to 10 days for the service to be provisioned. How do I manage my UKCloud for Oracle Software environment? You can access your OVMs using: The remote console through the UKCloud Portal Remote access protocols (RDP/SSH) over a VPN or secure network Connectivity Can I connect to the UKCloud Assured OFFICIAL environment? Yes, this service is available on the Assured OFFICIAL environment with connections to the internet, PSN, Janet and HSCN networks. Can I connect to the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL environment? Yes, this service is available on the Elevated OFFICIAL environment with connections to the PSN and RLI networks. Is there connectivity from other regions to Oracle? There is no native connectivity from other regions to Oracle other than customers configuring IPsec VPNs. Support What storage options are supported? The Oracle platform supports Tier 1 block storage for fast transactional databases, Tier 2 block storage for predictable work patterns and object storage for media content or to store recovery manager backups. Does the UKCloud platform support Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC)? Yes, you are able to configure RAC solutions to run on the UKCloud Oracle platform by creating a shared disk. How are Oracle software products supported on the UKCloud platform? Providing that the software products have the appropriate operating system, software licences and are installed on supported guest operating systems, they can be run on UKCloud for Oracle Software.

This Getting Started Guide provides an overview of the functionality available with UKCloud for Oracle Software. Intended audience This guide is intended for customers who want to get up and running with UKCloud for Oracle Software. Introduction to UKCloud for Oracle Software Many applications running in the UK Public Sector today have a backbone powered by Oracle software. They include ERP solutions, finance systems (such as payroll), HR systems and wide variety of citizen‑supporting applications. Oracle solutions have traditionally been subject to licensing and technical requirements that have made it challenging to carry out cloud transition projects and meet the government's Cloud First policy. UKCloud for Oracle Software enables you to start your cloud journey with your Oracle applications. It overcomes the licensing and technical barriers, and provides the trusted, connected and flexible Assured OFFICIAL and non-internet-connected Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platforms you need to deliver your critical Oracle applications in the cloud. UKCloud for Oracle Software can help you achieve the business goals at the centre of your strategy, without risking your operational ability to execute. The service has been designed and tested for compatibility with the most popular Oracle applications used in citizen‑facing solutions today, including: Oracle database (including features such as encryption and Data Guard) Oracle WebLogic Server Oracle Fusion Applications Oracle Enterprise Manager Oracle E-Business Suite UKCloud for Oracle Software provides workloads with an uncontended infrastructure optimised for the performance and availability of Oracle workloads. You can right‑size the allocated resources to suit the changing demands of your application; ensuring performance and avoiding over‑capacity. You can specify the resource allocation of each workload independently: simply choose the appropriate CPU cores, amount of memory and required storage from the catalogue. The service offers the following technical benefits specific to Oracle workloads: Use of core-pinning technology means that Oracle workloads operating on the UKCloud platform aren't subject to the types of movement that can unbalance Oracle applications running on other cloud platforms The scalable nature of our service enables you to add or remove cores in line with your understanding of the performance requirements of your solution Self-service management of your environment via our Customer Portal, which you can also use to programmatically control your Oracle environment Virtual firewalls to manage connectivity into and out of your environment -- self-service and free of charge IPsec and SSL VPN/SDN to create secure connections between users and other environments using a variety of included tunnelling technologies Basic load balancing to configure active/active solutions that are resilient to outages and can handle high levels of activity, using our on‑platform, out‑of‑the‑box load balancers Persistent storage so that your data remains, even when a virtual machine (VM) is turned off, ensuring that your application data remains consistent and available Oracle licensing compliance UKCloud for Oracle Software does not include Oracle licensing but, because the platform is powered by OVM technology, you can be assured that it is compliant with Oracle's licensing requirements and you can bring your own Oracle licensing to build your solutions. UKCloud ensures that hard partitioning is in place in all customer guest VMs in order to conform to Oracle licensing policies. When you create or modify a VM, automatic CPU pinning ensures that the VM won't use any CPUs other than the ones specifically pinned to the VM's vCPUs.

On the Infrastructure -- Oracle VM Cloud Services page you can view and manage all your Oracle VMs. More information! How to build an Oracle virtual machine Setting up your network Before you can start using the VMs in your Oracle environment, you need to create the network that connects the VMs to each other, and potentially also to the outside world. This network enables your VMs to communicate with each other or access external networks. A single Oracle tenant can have multiple networks. When UKCloud sets up a new Oracle tenant for you, we'll usually create an edge gateway for that tenant, but the creation of any networks is your responsibility. Networking and connectivity for UKCloud for Oracle Software is managed within VMware Cloud Director, which you access through the UKCloud Portal rather than Enterprise Manager Cloud Control. Note Because you create your network in VMware Cloud Director, you'll see references to VMware terminology, such as organisations and virtual data centres (VDCs). In UKCloud for Oracle Software, an Oracle tenant is equivalent to a VDC. There are two types of network: An isolated (internally connected) network provides access only to the VMs within the Oracle tenant (see How to create an isolated VDC network ). A routed (externally connected) network provides access to machines and networks outside the Oracle tenant via the edge gateway. You can have up to nine usable routed networks per tenant: one for each connectivity type (see How to create a routed VDC network ). Configuring your edge gateway An edge gateway controls how traffic from the outside world comes into and out of your environment. It is very important to make sure that your edge gateway is configured correctly to make your applications available but also secure. The tools for configuring your edge gateway are provided within VMware Cloud Director, which you access through the UKCloud Portal rather than Enterprise Manager Cloud Control. Your edge gateway provides the following services: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) --- The edge gateway can act as a DHCP server for VMs connected to VDC networks connected to an edge (see How to create a DHCP pool ). Network address translation (NAT) --- NAT rules determine where to direct inbound and outbound traffic (see How to create NAT rules ). Firewall --- The firewall controls which networks and ports can communicate through the edge gateway (see How to create firewall rules ). Static routing --- Provides static routes from the edge gateway to other networks, for example, networks in other VDCs in your compute service (see How to create a static route ). VPN --- IPsec site-to-site VPN is available on the edge gateway (see How to configure IPsec VPN ). Load balancing --- The edge gateway provides simple HTTP and HTTPS load balancing using round robin (see How to configure a load balancer ). Logging out of the Cloud Control console When you're done working in the Cloud Control console, we recommend that you log out to prevent unauthorised access. To log out of the Cloud Control console, click your user name and select Log Out . Next steps In this Getting Started Guide, you've learned the basics about UKCloud for Oracle Software.

Before you begin This article assumes that you're running an Oracle Database workload using 11 g or later on Linux or Windows. It also assumes that databases are production-ready, running in ArchiveLog mode. Required details When planning your database backup architecture, you must meet the following requirements: Platform - A virtual machine (VM), running on a virtualisation infrastructure Operating system (OS) - Linux or Windows Database software - This article is specifically targeted at Oracle RDBMS You also need to know the following: Database installation - Whether you're using 11 g (non-CDB) or 12 c + Database size - The size of the database plus online redo log (ORL) Available space - Storage volumes provisioned for the database server Recovery time objective (RTO) - This is the targeted duration of time and a service level within which a business process must be restored after a disaster or disruption in order to avoid unacceptable consequences associated with a break in business continuity -- how much time did it take to recover after notification of business process disruption? Recovery point objective (RPO) - Defined by business continuity planning, this is the maximum targeted period in which data (transactions) might be lost from an IT service due to a major incident Backup architecture guidelines Once you've gathered all the Required details , you should consider the following guidelines for the different elements of your environment. The virtual machine This is the VM in which the OS is installed. The OS should be confined to 25GB, to keep the core small (therefore cheaper and faster to recover the VM). This can scale up to 50GB, depending on your specific requirements, but the smaller the better. Use virtual disks for storage: One main volume for the database itself One volume for the fast recovery area (FRA) One volume to hold backups (depending on need and budget) If possible, offload backups to object storage, which is a cheaper alternative for long-term storage In an ideal scenario, the volume that holds the OS software should be isolated from the volume used for data. The OS volume should also contain the Oracle software. If applications are deployed on the database server, you can create and mount one (or more) volumes on /opt/app<nn>,/var/app<nn>,/usr/local/app<nn>, or other mount points depending on your architecture and requirements. This makes volume management, VM recovery and cloning easier and, most importantly, keeps data isolated from other resources. The database The database itself (data files + ORL) is kept on the main data volume, which is usually bigger than the database size, to accommodate database growth and the first copy of the ORL. You should use another volume to host the Oracle fast recovery area. This volume may hold a second copy of the ORL and online database backups. If you plan to store one full backup in the fast recovery area, size this volume accordingly. Depending on the database size and recovery requirements, you may choose to have more than one volume to store data. Given the Oracle database architecture, you can add data volumes (online to the VM) at any time without downtime. As has already been stated, the key is to keep data separated from the OS and and apps data. This configuration makes it easier to manage the database server and removes the need to deal with volumes that are too big or too small when space pressure is critical. The suggestion is to keep things simple: The OS on one volume Data in another volume(s) Backups in another (or offload to object storage) Backup strategy Your strategy depends on several factors. Database size could be one of the main drivers because of the storage cost in case of big databases and the time it takes to restore or recover. The first decisions to take are when to take a backup (how frequent it should be) and the type of backup (full or incremental). A typical backup strategy might be: Monday to Friday Daily incremental backups: The nightly backup and maintenance window (big databases) Full database backup: The nightly backup and maintenance window (small databases) Saturday and Sunday Full backup: The weekend maintenance window (big and small databases) Backup management: Backup archiving, backup cleanup, reporting Things can change, depending on your requirements. If you need a full backup on a Monday and Friday, just adjust the strategy to suit within the maintenance window to reduce the impact on the normal workload. The overall strategy is basically (unless you have specific constraints on availability): An incremental backup is taken on a daily basis, with a full backup during the weekend When you have specific constraints, you can include the backup strategy in the disaster recovery (DR) strategy: One primary database is used by the business, with a secondary database used for backup and reporting This scenario includes at least two databases: a primary and a secondary/standby, where the secondary is a copy of the primary (physical or logical). Keeping things simple The easiest solution to implement keeps moving parts at a minimum. Take one incremental database backup daily. If you're licensed to use Oracle Block Change Tracking, such a backup can be very fast. Backups are taken via the Oracle Recovery Manager (RMAN). Backups can be compressed and, optionally, encrypted. Take one full backup during the weekend, assuming the workload on the database during that period is lower than usual. A daily job is added to the host crontab, for the Oracle software user. It fires a script to run the RMAN backup session. The job should be fired by a scheduler external to the database. If the database has failed, the job can check whether the database is running before starting. On *nix systems, the cron service is a very reliable service, and easy to use. You can use custom-built shell scripts to fire RMAN jobs, keep a log of backup sessions and build a report to send via email to DBAs or administrators. You can use an external job scheduler, depending on your existing infrastructure. You can store RMAN scripts on the VM file system or within the database. You can use an RMAN script to run the daily backup check (crosscheck), find backups that are no longer needed (obsolete) and verify if some files are missing (archived logs). When checks are completed, the actual backup is taken. UKCloud can provide more detailed instructions and scripts, but these will need to be specifically defined for each customer. As a multi-cloud provider, UKCloud is responsible for the infrastructure; any intervention inside the OS hosted on a customer VM must be planned and approved. You can keep one backup on disk, in the fast recovery area (having allocated enough room on the storage volume), and archive older backups. In an ideal scenario, the last full backup should be kept on disk. When the next full backup is taken, the old ones should be moved to object storage. UKCloud is currently working to make an object storage solution available for the UKCloud for Oracle Software service. Oracle RMAN is already capable of taking backups directly against Amazon S3-compatible object storage devices. When the architecture is more articulated In a full Oracle Database architecture, there is a primary database and a secondary database. The primary database replicates via Data Guard (physical standby) or GoldenGate (logical standby, real-time), to a secondary database. When recovery time can be expanded to several hours, you could implement a custom replication solution as a cheaper alternative to Data Guard: The primary database produces archived log files. These files are shipped to a secondary database host. The standby host receives the archived log files, logs them into a storage volume and checks integrity after transfer. The standby holds an Oracle Database open in media recovery mode (like dg) and, every time an archived log is shipped, it's automatically applied to the standby. If a primary database failure occurs, the standby receives the last archived redo log and applies it. The database is open with resetlogs, ready to be used. The application (middleware) needs to be pointed to the new database server IP/hostname address. This procedure (except the middleware bit) is fully automated. The main differences to Data Guard are: Pro - No broker, easy to implement, cheap to drive. Con - Manual management, replication relies on archived logs to be generated (log switch happens at a higher frequency). The database backup is taken on the secondary. The same considerations apply, but to the standby. The primary database is not affected by backup jobs, which run on the standby. This is a typical Oracle Database setup, with a primary and a standby, where the standby is usually located on a separate host, away from the primary. When things get complicated In a complex architecture, an Oracle Database cluster is built using Real Application Clusters (RAC). When using RAC, you don't need to set the High Availability (HA) feature on Oracle VM Server and can take advantage of hard partitioning, which helps in saving on Database software licensing (given that a full RAC installation requires the Enterprise Edition). The database runs in a cluster with 2+ nodes, using shared storage and an interconnect network. VMs in the cluster can provide high availability. One node in the cluster replicates the database to a second site, which can use either another RAC or a single instance database. The same considerations seen before work here: the database backup is taken on the standby database. CDB or non-CDB Oracle 12 c introduced the multi-tenant option, which changed the way databases are managed with regards to storage and users. From a backup perspective, things don't change much. You should still use RMAN to operate backup and recovery. A common approach is to use the multi-tenant option, but implementing databases using a single-tenant configuration (one CDB that holds one PDB). The single-tenant option is free of charge; multi-tenancy requires a licence. In a cloud environment, with databases running within VMs, Oracle Database 12 c single-tenancy seems to be the ideal option. Backup metadata management When using RMAN to take database backups, one of the choices you need to make is whether to use a backup catalog or not. For small installations, a catalog is not strictly needed. The catalog helps when there is more than one database included in the backup strategy, or the estate, because it holds all the metadata related to the backup sessions in one single place. In a complex environment, you should use a central job scheduler to keep track of all the backup (and other type) jobs and targets. This is a host that can communicate with all the database servers, initiate backup sessions, manage backups metadata and generate reports. Oracle does offer a solution, Secure Backup, but this is not particularly user-friendly. You can also use Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM), and you can directly schedule backups in Cloud Control. Or you may choose to develop a custom option to manage backup jobs, backup metadata in the RMAN catalog and generate reports. A project to offer a ready-to-use backup solution (easy to implement and use) for the UKCloud for Oracle Software service is under development. This solution relies on an object storage backend to hold long-term backups. It's aim is to provide a simple tool (specifically, a CLI tool, to be embedded in scripts) to manage backup requirements. Backup testing You should test and validate backups every six months, or more depending on your own business requirements. This provides certainty that, if a failure occurs, a backup can be safely used to restore and recover the database server's data. If a backup solution is available, as mentioned above, you should be able to schedule such a task. To perform backup testing, fire up a VM to manage backup validation, restore and database recovery. The idea is to provide a fully automated tool to test backup integrity and provide an automated procedure for restore and recovery. You pay only for the storage used for the time the restore takes place, if the restore is successful. This could be seen as a fire drill for the database, conducted every <n> months, to make sure the procedures are well defined and tested. If something fails, you can adjust the procedure to make sure it will be ready for a real-world scenario.

    "keywords": "Oracle licensing on the UKCloud platform Important UKCloud for Oracle Software has been retired from sale by UKCloud. We'll continue to support all existing customers who are using this service, however, we are no longer providing this service for new workloads. This article provides existing UKCloud for Oracle Software customers with access to support documentation and we'll continue to update it as required. For new Oracle requests, contact your Client Director or Service Delivery Manager. Overview Due to the licensing rules regarding Oracle, it is not possible to install and run processor-based Oracle software on UKCloud for VMware, UKCloud for OpenStack or UKCloud for Microsoft Azure. However, you can use UKCloud for Oracle Software to run Oracle applications and databases. This is a solution specifically designed using Oracle VM hypervisor technology to enable Oracle licensing to be used correctly. It is also financially efficient as you only need to license software for resources used. However, you still need to be mindful of Oracle licensing when using UKCloud for Oracle Software. UKCloud can resell all Oracle software and support contracts and can provide advice where required to help. Important Licensing rules from vendors such as Oracle can change frequently, so you should validate your specific requirements with Oracle at the time of ordering. The information in this article is correct as of November 2019. If you want to license Oracle software on virtual machines within the UKCloud platform, there are some important issues to consider with regards to the licensing options available, which are described below. Per host (x86) Oracle Enterprise Linux (OEL) is a free x86 operating system (OS) that Oracle provides for customers to run Oracle software on. While the OS itself is free to use, the support associated with the OS is not free, and is charged per-host being used. In a cloud environment, this cost model is a bit of a challenge as we have many hosts and customers will not be using all of them for their workloads. So, to work out how many support contracts you should get for OEL, you should use the following formula: Number of cores used = Total number of vCPUs running OEL (i.e., add up all OEL VMs vCPUs) / 2 Number of hosts you need OEL support contracts for (rounded up to nearest whole number) = Number of cores used / 20 (the number of useable cores per host) Per processor This type of licence is typical of Oracle Database (both Enterprise and Standard) and enables you to have as many users as you need for a fixed cost 'per processor' that the servers run on. As UKCloud runs Oracle VM (OVM) as the hypervisor technology for UKCloud for Oracle Software, you can simply license the processors (cores) that you require for your application and database VMs, rather than all the processors within the cluster. The VMs are pinned to host cores to maintain licence compliance so you should be aware of licensing implications of using features such as High Availability (HA) or clustering technologies, such as Real Application Clusters (RAC). With the HA feature (see How to enable high availability for your Oracle VMs ), VMs will power off in the event of a host failure and will be restarted on another host in the cluster. Typically, processor-based licences will allow a certain number of 'failover days' per year (typically 10 days), including maintenance scenarios, so you should be aware of this number and remove VMs from any HA policy if your VM has moved due to maintenance or server downtime for close to the number of days stated in the licence agreement. If you're replicating using technologies like RAC, you'll need to make sure you're licensing enough processors to cover the additional VMs within the cluster. To work out the number of processors (cores) you need to license within UKCloud, perform the following simple calculation: Number of cores used = Total number of vCPUs running Oracle Database / 2 There is a core-factor that needs to be applied when it comes to licensing Oracle database licences. For the purposes of this, use the Intel Xeon core factor in the Oracle Processor Core Factor Table . Named User Plus By implementing this licensing option, you may achieve better economics, but this option is generally only applicable when the application or database is used by a known, limited pool of users. You should also be able quantify how many people are accessing these databases and be aware if that user base grows beyond the user you have got licensed. There are some complexities here around minimum numbers of users and cores within the various database options, so make sure you follow the guidance on licensing published by Oracle. For databases, you can find this in the Database Licensing document. Our Cloud Architects can help you understand the most cost-effective method for licensing. Special agreements In certain circumstances an organisation may have a special agreement with Oracle. Generally, these are big government or private organisations who have gone through serious negotiations to get those agreements - an example of this being a Perpetual Licence Agreement (PULA), which enables an organisation to consume as many Oracle licences for particular software as they require. If you have a special agreement with Oracle, let us know as it comes with benefits such as live VM migration, which generally isn't allowed in other scenarios. Application Specific Full Use licensing An Application Specific Full Use (ASFU) licence is a restricted type of licence sold by a Solution Provider in conjunction with its third-party Application Package. For example, you can buy an ASFU licence from SAP AG to use Oracle with the SAP/R3 system. This licence would then be application-specific and cannot be used for anything else. Note The ASFU licensing option is outside the scope of UKCloud control. Embedded Software License An Embedded Software License (ESL) is a very restrictive licence type available from Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) who embed Oracle technology into their product. An end-user may not even be aware that the software package contains Oracle technology and should not be able to access it directly as a developer or system administrator. An example of this licensing model in use may be a Point of Sale system that requires a database to log transactions. Note The ESL licensing option is outside the scope of UKCloud control.

This article provides existing UKCloud for Oracle Software customers with access to support documentation and we'll continue to update it as required. For new Oracle requests, contact your Client Director or Service Delivery Manager. Overview UKCloud for Oracle Software VM pricing can be as low as 9p per hour. Full pricing with all options, including licensing and connectivity, is available in the UKCloud Pricing Guide . Oracle workloads are priced per hour for compute resources, and monthly for storage. Your bills are based on the resources you actually allocate to your solution. In contrast to traditional hosting models, this ensures that there's no lock-in to unnecessarily licensed or under-utilised hardware. Our flexible pricing enables you map neatly to your existing specifications and scale resources up or down based on new or changing requirements. You're not constrained to the resources identified in an early design phase. Licensing UKCloud for Oracle Software includes the base OVM licences, which provide VM containers that meet Oracle's definition of hard partitioning. Our service doesn't include licences for the Oracle applications and databases you choose to run. As the underlying platform is powered by OVM technology, you can either transfer your existing licences, or confidently buy new licences based on the quantity of virtual processors you allocate within each VM. If you need help defining the best licensing approach for your situation, we can introduce you to one of our partners who specialise in Oracle licensing compliance, optimisation and fulfillment. Pricing example Oracle flavour: x86 Machine size: 2 cores * , 4GiB RAM Storage used: 100GiB Tier 2 block storage * Cores refers to physical processor cores. VM cost per month An Oracle x86 VM costs £0.075 per core per hour and £0.015 per GiB RAM per hour. So, an Oracle x86 VM with 2 cores and 4GiB RAM costs (2 x £0.075) + (4 x £0.015) = £0.15 + £0.06 = £0.21 per hour. In an average 730 hour month, the monthly VM cost works out at 730 x £0.21 = £153.30 . Storage cost per month Tier 2 costs £0.10 per GiB per month. 100GiB of additional storage costs £10.00 per month. Total basic cost Calculate the total basic cost by adding together the monthly VM and storage costs. VM cost per month + Storage cost per month = Total basic cost £153.30 + £10.00 = £163.30 Discount options The following discount and purchase schemes are available with UKCloud for Oracle Software: Commitment discount Annual subscription discount Cloud Credits For more information about the discount and purchase schemes offered by UKCloud, see the UKCloud Pricing Guide .

Introduction This article outlines what you need to do to make sure your Oracle VMs (OVMs) are compatible with UKCloud for Oracle Software service. You may find this useful if you're moving VMs from UKCloud for VMware to UKCloud for Oracle Software. OVF and VMDK OVF and VMDK files are not compatible with Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM), the management plane that's used to deploy and manage your UKCloud for Oracle Software environment. To make sure your VMs are compatible with UKCloud for Oracle Software you may need to transform your VMs. OVA files (Assembly option) and tar.gz/tgz (Template option) are the only accepted file formats. OVA If you select the Assembly option on the upload page, then the uploader will expect an OVA Assembly package file ( ova file). Your .ova file should contain the following files (in the exact order listed): MyVM .ovf - the OVF descriptor file, which contains all VM specs metadata and links to the embedded virtual disk image file (with a .vmdk extension) MyVM .mf - contains metadata that is used for integrity and authenticity checks; this data must be correct for the .ova file to be accepted in most cases MyVM .vmdk - the embedded virtual disk image file As the exported .ova file also contains file hashes that are unique to the files included in the package, simply creating a tar file with these contents will not work in most cases. For most virtualisation platforms, it's best to use the export functionality from the source virtualisation platform to generate the .ova file. One way of converting your VMs to an .ova file would be to use the OVF Tool, for example: ovftool \"original.ovf\" \"original.ova\" Tip Make sure you include the quotation marks ( \" ). You can download the OVF Tool from: https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/details?downloadGroup=OVFTOOL400&productId=353 TAR If you select the Template option on the upload page, then the uploader will expect an Oracle VM Template file (either a .tgz or .tar.gz file). This gzipped tarball file normally contains the following files (in the exact order listed): MyVM .cfg - contains the VM specs metadata and links to the embedded RAW disk image file, normally named system.img system.img - the embedded RAW disk image file, either exported from another XEN platform or converted from other virtual disk formats Upload size For any uploads larger than 500 MB, you'll need to allow sufficient time for the upload to complete before clicking the Upload button or it will fail and the item will not appear in your software library. There is currently no upload progress indicator on OEM. Oracle is aware of this but are treating it as an enhancement request therefore there's currently no indication of when the upload progress indicator will be added on future releases of the platform software.

About this document This document describes the boundaries of the UKCloud for Oracle software service, along with the division of responsibilities between UKCloud and the customer, to facilitate the provisioning and ongoing use of the service. About UKCloud for Oracle Software The UKCloud for Oracle Software service provides a secure, scalable and cost-effective platform for hosting Oracle virtual machines (OVMs) of various sizes. You can use the platform to build new services quickly and securely; and migrate, augment or transform existing Oracle-based applications. The platform is immediately available so you can provision and scale OVMs in minutes. Service architecture Your UKCloud service architecture is as follows: Company. Your contract with UKCloud is associated with a company, which provides a single owner for the contract, regardless of how many accounts are created. Account. We use accounts to separate financial ownership. An account could represent an organisation, a customer contract, or a specific project. An account can also have several UKCloud services associated with it, such as UKCloud for Oracle, Cloud Storage and UKCloud for OpenStack. You can also use accounts to separate users based on access requirements or permissions. Organisation. This represents your UKCloud for Oracle Software service inside Oracle Enterprise Manager and on the UKCloud Portal. There is a 1:1 mapping of service to Organisation. Oracle Tenant. An Oracle Tenant is where you define your workload type and build your OVMs. You can create Oracle Tenants by raising a service request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. Service configuration The UKCloud for Oracle Software infrastructure is uncontended and configured to optimise the performance and availability of Oracle workloads. There is only one service configuration on the UKCloud for Oracle Software platform, ensuring that OVMs are pinned to cores to stop OVM movement that would unbalance applications. Customers can self-configure OVMs by the number of cores, and amount of memory and storage needed. OVMs can be reconfigured to adjust resources in line with changing performance requirements. Self-service management is done through the Oracle Enterprise Management Portal, accessed through the UKCloud Portal. Full details of the available service options are outlined in the Service Definition . Storage options All storage is persistent and resilient to local hardware failures. Multiple storage options can be used to support different aspects of the application. Tier 1. Fast storage ideal for data warehouses, fast transactional databases or randomly executing workloads. Tier 2. General all-purpose storage, suitable for systems with human interactions or predictable work patterns. Cloud Storage. Ideal for serving media content or as a medium-term repository; can be used to store Recovery Manager (RMAN) backups. Storage policies We provide you with access to two storage policies: tier 1 and tier 2. We will initially provide you with a tier 2 storage policy, however you can request tier 1 storage be added to your Oracle Tenant so you can create additional disks with tier 1 storage on your OVMs. VM templates come with a 50GiB system disk and a secondary disk (equivalent to the size of the RAM associated with the OVM - up to 16GiB). These virtual disks are mapped from the tier 2 VM repository by default. For installations of Oracle apps on top of the OS, it's best to have separate non-OS virtual disks which are then mapped to mountpoints. The sizing requirements/recommendations for the non-OS storage can be found on the official Oracle installation guides and they can differ from version to version. You'll need to take into consideration future data growth while planning capacity, as this would also reflect on the capacity required for backups. We do not guarantee storage performance, as it can be affected by many factors. We do not provide IOPS figures for our storage offerings. Workloads can use multiple storage profiles. Protection UKCloud for Oracle Software does not include any infrastructure-level backup or disaster recovery functionality. However, the underpinning infrastructure supports native Oracle protection technologies such as Data Guard and RMAN. UKCloud's Cloud Storage can be used as an S3-addressable target for Oracle protection technologies. Service availability UKCloud for Oracle Software offers an SLA guarantee of 99.95% availability for VMs without high availability (HA) enabled. VMs with HA enabled have an SLA of 99.99%. Having HA enabled will not consume any additional resource on the platform, and is therefore free-of-charge, however, as this setting is not enabled by default, you must configure this through the UI. For more information, see How to enable high availability for your Oracle VMs . You are entitled to claim Service Credits for outages to services that take you out of the SLA. For more about how we calculate SLAs, see the SLA Definition document. Our SLA does not cover faults within your control, such as client application issues, or faults within external connectivity providers (for example, internet, PSN or HSCN). Service background UKCloud for Oracle Software is underpinned by Oracle compute infrastructure. UKCloud manage the physical infrastructure and utilise our partner, Infomentum, to provide support and management from the hypervisor level and above. Infomentum will provision your Oracle Tenant environment and UKCloud will present it to you through the Oracle Enterprise Manager. VM creation is currently available via service request to ensure that the platform remains balanced — this is due to the core-pinning technology that Oracle OVM uses. You'll need to submit a service request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal with the VM details, including resource allocation, and we'll create the VM. You can then manage the created VM. You must also raise a service request to change the size of a VM. For more information, see Oracle cloud self-service functionality . All service requests will be triaged by UKCloud. We reserve the right to escalate a request to Infomentum for support. If you have not have a managed service contract with Infomentum, please do not contact them directly. UKCloud actively capacity-manages the cloud platform to ensure you have access to the resources you request. The UKCloud platform is designed using sites, regions and zones. The relationship between them is shown below: You can specify Farnborough or Corsham as the site where you would like to have your service provisioned, and we will try to accommodate requests and will advise you if we are unable do so. We control the deployed versions of technology on the platform. This covers internal platform-supporting technologies, and any technology versions available to you. Internally this includes, but isn't limited to, the Oracle Virtual Machine Manager and Oracle Virtual Machine Server versions, and the hardware version of the platform. Externally this includes the available versions of the NSX Edge and Oracle Enterprise Manager. You can make additional configurations inside an OVM (such as implementing third-party software technologies). We do not support customer implementations inside a VM. Operating systems UKCloud for Oracle Software includes the base OVM platform licences, which provide VM containers that meet Oracle's definition of hard partitioning. Our service does not include licences for the Oracle applications and databases you choose to run. As the underlying platform is powered by OVM technology, you can either transfer your existing licences, or purchase new licences based on the quantity of cores you allocate within each VM. Please note that UKCloud does not have the functionality to provide Oracle licensing, and this must be sourced via an appropriate partner. Cores refers to physical processor cores (excluding hyper-threading). OVM cores have two threads, or vCPUs . Your Oracle licensing will be based on the cores consumed by your OVM. Update services. We make update repositories available for OVM containers. We don't provide software update facilities for non-UKCloud licensed software, including all Oracle applications or databases. Anti-virus. We do not provide anti-virus software as part of the service. Networks Internet-facing solutions. You are provided with 2 usable public IP addresses, but you can ask for additional public IP addresses by raising a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. We reserve the right to decline the request if you have spare capacity in your existing deployment. PSN-facing solutions. You should raise a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal to be assigned your IP address. This solution also comes with shared bandwidth (uncapped). Janet and HSCN solutions. You have one usable IP address, but you can request additional IP addresses by raising a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. UKCloud for Oracle Software does not have a native external connectivity functionality. Therefore, UKCloud have enabled customers to manage connectivity rules, such as firewall, IPsec VPN and NAT functionality, through a VMware NSX Edge. This Edge is provisioned within the UKCloud for VMware environment and is managed using either the UKCloud Portal GUI or API. This Edge can be an existing edge in a customer's UKCloud for VMware environment, or can be provisioned as a completely new entity, specific for Oracle. NSX Edge By default, we assign one Edge per connectivity type. You can choose which external network you would like to enable your Oracle environment to connect to. Note that the Oracle environment does not have to connect to an external network, however an external network will need to be connected to the Edge. Site-to-site IPsec VPN. You can create IPsec VPN tunnels to connect different environments, both internal and external, to UKCloud. There is a limit of 64 tunnels per Edge. Bring Your Own Firewall Bring Your Own Firewall is currently not available for UKCloud for Oracle Software installations; however, you can have BYOF within UKCloud for VMware and connect it to the UKCloud for Oracle Software edge gateway via an IPsec VPN. Protective monitoring We have implemented GPG 13-aligned Protective Monitoring across the Assured and Elevated platforms at the hypervisor level and below. We don't provide Protective Monitoring services above the hypervisor (for example, for your VM). Components above this infrastructure are your own responsibility to provide an appropriate protective monitoring capability. In line with UKCloud's System Interconnect and Security Policy (SISP), we provide notification of customer-impacting security incidents. It is your responsibility to report similar incidents to us. Platform management Users can access, manage and view the UKCloud for Oracle Software service, accessing only those features allowed by their role, in any of the following ways: Oracle Enterprise Manager. The graphical interface for the creation and management of the Oracle environment. vCloud API. Enables the programmatic creation and management of the Oracle edge gateway. VMware Cloud Director tenant portal. Provides a graphical interface to access the VMware Cloud Director environment to manage the Oracle NSX Edge (depending on assigned permissions). UKCloud Portal. Enables access to the VMware Cloud Director and Oracle Enterprise Manager services. The Portal also includes an overview of service configuration information. Access to incident and request management is also possible through the Portal. You cannot access the underlying infrastructure. This includes (but isn't limited to) the hardware and the Oracle Virtual Machine Manager environment. Service migration UKCloud do not currently provide migration services, however customers are free to bring their own migration tools and utilise them within the UKCloud for Oracle Software environment. Service reporting Visibility. Maintenance notifications and Service Status reports are delivered through the portal. Billing. Billing is issued on a monthly basis where you will be billed for your total monthly consumption. Customer service Cloud Architect. UKCloud Cloud Architects support you during the design of solutions for the cloud platform. UKCloud Cloud Architects are ideally placed to help reconcile your requirements with the UKCloud platform. We recommend engagement with a Cloud Architect when implementing Oracle solutions. Service Delivery Manager (SDM). An assigned point of contact who will provide any assistance you require during your use of the service, including onboarding, service reviews and incident reporting and escalation. Support Desk. After the initial on-boarding and design phase, you can utilise the standard UKCloud support entitlement, which is documented in the Customer Engagement Factsheet . Customer responsibilities You are responsible for assessing whether the UKCloud UKCloud for Oracle Software platform can support the various requirements of your application. The control and management of access and responsibilities for end users including appropriate connectivity, security and accreditation if required. If access is required over government secure networks (HSCN, Janet, RLI or PSN), you are responsible for adhering to the relevant Code of Connection (CoCo) and for providing evidence of their CoCo to UKCloud upon request. UKCloud is unable to provide access to secure networks where such evidence has not been provided. Management and administration of layers above the Oracle hypervisor (OS patching, application performance monitoring, user administration). You are also responsible for ensuring only lawful data that supports the UK public sector is stored and processed by applications on this environment, and that they fully comply with the UKCloud Security Operating Procedures (SyOPs) and other information assurance requirements as specified in the UKCloud SISP and associated accreditation documentation sets. Service provisioning Within four (4) working hours of accepting an order (shorter deployment times are typically achieved and can be prioritised upon request), UKCloud will create the customer's Primary Administrator account and send a welcome pack which includes the URL for the UKCloud Customer Portal, and the getting started guide. UKCloud and Infomentum will provision the Oracle Tenant environment. UKCloud will request information such as private subnets before creating the environment. Once the build is complete, UKCloud will provide you with access to provision Oracle virtual machines and Oracle networks. UKCloud has created several videos, help guides, manuals and FAQs to help train and instruct users so that they are up and running quickly and easily. These are available within the UKCloud Knowledge Centre . UKCloud also has a large ecosystem of partners who can deliver additional services, such as support and professional services.

    "title": "Invoice and billing FAQs",
    "keywords": "Invoice and billing FAQs General When will I be billed? We send out invoices on the first day of each month for the previous month's usage. How can I pay? Payment for UKCloud services can be made by direct bank transfer (BACS/CHAPS). You can find bank details for payment on your invoice. How is my invoice formatted? Your invoice includes a line for each chargeable service. For example, there might be a row for your UKCloud for VMware charges, one for Cloud Storage and another for HSCN connectivity. What is the evidence file? The UKCloud evidence file is a CSV file provided with your invoice that contains data on your hourly metered charges per month and corroborates how the totals invoiced are derived. Each row in the evidence file represents a chargeable period for a UKCloud service, for example, a VMware VM, OpenStack VM (or instance) or Cross Domain Security Zone Walled Garden. Each row includes usage hours/minutes and relevant charges for that service. How are usage hours rounded? Usage hours are typically rounded up, however there is a maximum of 24 hours total of usage hours per event date per resource ID. Billable hours are calculated as follows: Items with the same VM type, power type, protection type are grouped together. For each group of items with the same VM type and protection type with the power state of on the total number of usage minutes is rounded up to the nearest hour (this is capped to a maximum of 24 hours). Billable hours are allocated to the first matching rated item. The process is then repeated for each group of items with the same VM type and protection type, with the power state of off . What about services that aren't in the evidence file? Some metered services are not yet integrated into the evidence file. You can find details of these services on your invoice. UKCloud for VMware charges How are my UKCloud for VMware VM charges calculated? The cost of your UKCloud for VMware VMs is determined by adding together the cost of your compute, storage, protection and licensing. You can find these individual costs in the following columns of the evidence file in rows of the service type (column H) of VMware VM : Description Column Compute U Tier 1 Storage AE Tier 2 Storage AK Geo-resilient Storage AQ Protection BA Licensing BC The compute cost of a VM (column U) is determined by the amount of time the VM was powered on (column N), the VM size (column O), power level (column P) and security domain (column Q). How many VMs do I have and what t-shirt size are they? Each VM is identified in the spreadsheet by its resource ID (column F). Each VM will have multiple rows depending on when it was created and its different power state during the billing period. The size of the VM is indicated by its Compute Machine Type (column O). Note For user-defined VMs, the highest resource closest to the VM size will dictate the cost. For example 2 vCPU and 16GiB will be charged at the Medium High Memory cost. Do I have any vCloud snapshots that I'm being charged for? If you've taken manual vCloud snapshots of your VM, you'll see these in the following columns of the evidence file: Description Column Tier 1 storage allocated for vCloud snapshots AA Tier 2 storage allocated for vCloud snapshots AG Geo-resilient storage allocated for vCloud snapshots AM How many hours are my VMs on per month? Usage hours are listed in the evidence file in column N (UsageHours). To see how many hours your VMs are on for month, look for the usage hours in rows with a service type (column H) of VMware VM and a power state (column L) of on . How much block storage are my VMs using? The amount and cost of block storage for your VMs is listed in the evidence file under the following columns: Description Column Tier 1 Storage used Z Tier 1 Storage cost AE Tier 2 Storage used AF Tier 2 Storage cost AK Geo-resilient Storage used AL Geo-resilient Storage cost AQ Note 60GiB of Tier 2 storage is included in the pricing for all VMs whilst they are powered on, except for Micro, which has 10GiB of included storage. For VMs in powered-off state, consumed storage will be charged at the prevailing rate. What are the protection costs for my VMs? Protection costs for your VM are listed in the following columns of the evidence file: Description Column Protection cost for the VM AT Protection cost for Tier 1 storage AX Protection cost for Tier 2 storage AY Protection cost for Geo-resilient storage AZ Total protection cost BA The cost of protection depends on the protection type (column AR) you have applied to your VM and block storage. The protection type for your VM and its block storage must be the same. How much storage am I using for independent disks, media and templates? UKCloud for VMware costs also include storage used by any independent disks, media and templates you have, which is listed as separate rows in the evidence file. Look for rows with the service type (column H) of VMware Independent Disk, VMware Media and VMware Template. How much am I spending on Windows licensing on my estate? The operating system installed on your VM is shown in column G of the evidence file. Associated licensing costs are shown in column BC. How can I divide up the costs of my estate, for example between different projects, departments or cost centres? You can add metadata to your individual VMs, which propagates to the evidence file (as a semi colon-separated list in column I). You can then add your own formulas to the evidence file spreadsheet to use that metadata to cross charge workloads. For example, if you use metadata to assign VMs to different cost centres or projects, you could add formulas to divide VM charges across those different cost centres or projects. Note The VM metadata will be listed in the evidence file on the day after you tag the VM. For example, if you tag your VM on the 3rd, the metadata will be listed in the evidence file from the 4th, unless a VM power cycle occurs on the 3rd. The How to use VM location article includes information about how to access metadata for your VMs. UKCloud for OpenStack charges How are my UKCloud for OpenStack charges calculated? The cost of your UKCloud for OpenStack instances is determined by adding together the cost of your compute and storage. You can find these individual costs in the following columns of the evidence file in rows of the service type (column H) of OpenStack Virtual Machine : Description Column Compute U Tier 1 Storage (or Encrypted Storage) AE Tier 2 Storage (or Encrypted Storage) AK The compute cost of an instance (column U) is determined by the instance size (column O), security domain (column Q), vCPU (column R), and memory (column S). Are shelved instances included in the evidence file? When you shelve an OpenStack instance, all compute charges for that instance cease, so it no longer appears in the evidence file as an OpenStack Virtual Machine row. When an instance is shelved, a snapshot is taken, so the evidence file includes an OpenStack Image row for the instance, which details the storage charges for that snapshot. How much block storage are my instances using? Block storage for OpenStack instances is included in the evidence as separate line items with the service type (column H) of OpenStack Block Storage Tier 1 or OpenStack Block Storage Tier 2 or OpenStack Block Storage Tier 1 Encrypted or OpenStack Block Storage Tier 2 Encrypted . The amount and cost of block storage is provided in the following columns: Description Column Tier 1 Storage used Z Tier 1 Storage cost AE Tier 2 Storage used AF Tier 2 Storage cost AK UKCloud for OpenStack storage costs also include any images and backups you have, which are listed as separate rows in the evidence file. Look for rows with the service type (column H) of OpenStack Image and OpenStack Instance Backup Storage .

    "title": "Enterprise & Private Sector FAQs",
    "keywords": "Enterprise & Private Sector FAQs General What do we define as Enterprise & Private Sector customers? Commercial organisations in the Private Sector, especially those in regulated industries that want the choice (no technology or contractual lock-in), assurance (sovereignty and security) and award-winning expertise (customer services) of the UKCloud platform. Which products/services are available to Enterprise & Private Sector organisations? All products and services will be available except for Cross Domain Security Zone, Secure Remote Access, connectivity to public sector networks and access to the Elevated and Tier 2 security domains. Can non-UK companies purchase UKCloud services? Yes. A number of our existing non-UK partners utilise our services for use within the UK for UK-based customers and transactions in line with UK data regulations. Can Enterprise & Private Sector organisations use Crown Campus? No. Crown Hosting is designed specifically and exclusively for use by the UK Public Sector and so Crown Campus will not be relevant to Enterprise & Private Sector organisations. The Private Sector is able to procure space directly from Ark, and so UKCloud will be able to deliver equivalent private cloud and hybrid cloud solutions between Ark data rooms and the UKCloud platform. Can Enterprise & Private Sector customers use the Elevated security domain for sensitive data? No. The Elevated security domain and the Tier 2 security domain are designed to be used only by Public Sector organisations as they are connected to restricted government networks. Enterprise & Private Sector customers can use only the Assured security domain, which is connected to our DDoS-protected internet service, and hence they should design and architect a secure workload to safeguard their data in the same way that Public Sector customers have done. What are your service SLAs? All of our services have formal SLAs supported by service credits. As there is a specific SLA for each service, please review the SLA Definition article in our Knowledge Centre. Will Enterprise & Private Sector customers share the same estate as UK Public Sector? Yes. The UKCloud platform has been designed and has evolved to support all types of workloads with a high level of security, resilience and performance. Data and customer separation of workloads is a fundamental part of our solution and therefore, there are no reasons why the two communities cannot share the same platform. There are some exceptions; Private Sector customers will not be able to access the following services: Elevated and Tier 2 security domains Cross Domain Security Zone Secure Remote Access Government community networks (unless sponsored by a public-sector organisation as part of a solution) Are IPv6 addresses available? We are not currently able to support IPv6, although this is on our technical roadmap. Please contact our technical teams to discuss this further if it a requirement for your solution. Pricing & ordering What pricing is available for Enterprise & Private Sector customers? Enterprise & Private Sector customers receive the same pricing as our public sector customers. Where do I find pricing? All of our UKCloud Service Definitions, Pricing Guide and Terms and Conditions are available from our Knowledge Centre , and are also linked from the Enterprise & Private Sector section of our website . Note that the pricing guide includes some services, security domains and connectivity options that are only available to public sector customers. How do I order? All of our customers, regardless of sector, can order the same way via our sales team who can be contacted by calling 01252 303300 (option 3) or by emailing info@ukcloud.com . There are also contact details on the main website Contact us page. Are you able to supply licensing for use by Enterprise & Private Sector customers? Yes. All of our licensing agreements are open to either Public or Private Sector customers, including Microsoft following their removal of G-SPLA where we now supply licenses using corporate SPLA. Do any UKCloud partners cater for Enterprise & Private Sector customers? Yes. We have a large ecosystem of partners, including large system integrators, popular managed service providers and specialist SaaS providers, who already deliver a wide range of services to both Public Sector and Private Sector. Many of these partners share similar characteristics with UKCloud's platform and specialise in high security, excellent service and domain expertise. Contact us by calling 01252 303300 (option 3) or by emailing info@ukcloud.com for further information. Is there a free trial? Yes. We offer a 30-day free trial for many of our services.

    "keywords": "MISO rebate FAQs General What is the MISO rebate? Crown Commercial Service (CCS) operates a management charge of between 0.75% and 1.15% for every service sold through the G-Cloud framework agreements. This charge is calculated from monthly reports submitted by G-Cloud suppliers to the CCS Management Information System Online (MISO). We'll rebate 0.5% of the charge that partners incur as a result of selling our services via G-Cloud. What is included and excluded? We'll rebate any MISO charges incurred directly due to selling UKCloud services. We won't rebate any MISO charges incurred for any services over and above the UKCloud element of the service, for example managed service wraps charged as part of the overall solution. When did the MISO rebate go live? You can make claims for relevant MISO charges incurred since 1 August 2016. When can I claim? There are two windows per year when you can submit a claim: March and September. However, if any claim reaches more than £500, we'll consider an earlier submission. How do I apply for the MISO rebate? Send UKCloud evidence of the charges you have incurred by selling our services through G-Cloud. We have created a form for you to use which is available on the portal. Please note, this is solely for an element of the overall MISO charge. We're not under any obligation to offer any rebate where the claim is not substantiated by sufficient evidence. How will the rebate be applied? We'll apply the rebate by crediting your next monthly invoice by the amount you have applied for. What happens if CCS increases the G-Cloud management charges? The MISO rebate that we offer to our partners will be limited to 0.5%, irrespective of the MISO charge levied by CCS to its suppliers.

    "title": "Service Level Agreement FAQs",
    "keywords": "Service Level Agreement FAQs General How does UKCloud determine if a service is available or not? UKCloud's approach to measuring service availability is to consider all the various elements and components (such as internal networks, the portal and the service technology stack) that can ultimately affect the availability of a service. These individual components are monitored and if one fails, the service may be deemed unavailable. We believe this approach gives a more representative and pragmatic view of service availability. More information about our services and the specific monitors for availability can be found later in this document. How does UKCloud calculate the availability of its services? UKCloud calculates availability by monitoring specific components and then using the following formula to determine the percentage that a service was available for: P = A-B x 100 A, where: P= Percentage availability A= Total number of minutes in month B = Total number of whole minutes that service is unavailable How often do you monitor your services to determine availability? UKCloud polls our services every minute using a variety of methods that range from a basic ping test to a synthetic transaction which replicates a user's journey. The method used will depend on the specific component or service being monitored. At what point is a service deemed unavailable? UKCloud deem a service to be unavailable if after five consecutive negative responses, normal service has not resumed. At this point, the downtime will start to be recorded. Are any periods of downtime excluded from the availability SLA? UKCloud excludes any time needed to complete Planned or Emergency Maintenance from any time-based calculations related to service availability. In these events, you will be notified accordingly as described in our Terms and Conditions . Other exceptions are also outlined in the Terms and Conditions. Are there any reasons why you wouldn't pay a Service Credit if it was due? You will not be eligible to receive a Service Credit if your account has any undisputed payments outstanding beyond their due date or you are in violation of UKCloud's Terms and Conditions including the UKCloud System Interconnect Security Policy (SISP). Can I use my own information to report downtime of a service? No, UKCloud's monitoring tools, data and records (including support tickets) will be the sole source of information used to track and validate service availability. How do I request a Service Credit? To request a Service Credit, customers must raise a Service Request the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal within thirty (30) calendar days of the suspected SLA Event. UKCloud will review the request and issue a Service Credit if applicable either during that billing cycle or the subsequent one if the claim is made just after an invoice has been paid. Does UKCloud have an SLA that covers customer-owned hardware or appliances such as routers? If you wish to co-locate additional devices in UKCloud's data centre(s), this falls outside of UKCloud's responsibility and control, and therefore the devices will not be covered by a UKCloud SLA. If you are co-locating devices in our data centre(s), you should be aware that doing so could introduce single points of failure. Do you monitor your data centre networks and components? UKCloud monitors the data centre network between the physical hypervisor hosts or storage platform and the outside interface connecting the data centre network to any third-party networks (for example, PSN, Janet, internet, private circuits, and colocation environments). Portal How is the UKCloud portal monitored? What if I am unable to access my portal account? To confirm that the UKCloud Portal is available, UKCloud performs synthetic transactions by authenticating access to an account by a simulated user and retrieving a support ticket. This process demonstrates whether the UKCloud portal is accessible and that this element of the service is available. If you are unable to access your portal account to raise a support ticket, then you will need to call UKCloud on 01252 303300 and select option 2. Connectivity What SLA does UKCloud offer on connectivity? UKCloud does not offer any SLA covering the performance or availability of any external connection to the UKCloud platform, this includes internet, PSN or Janet, for example. Connections between services within UKCloud are covered by the SLA representing the services, including inter-DC connectivity between UKCloud's regions and sites. UKCloud for VMware How do you offer an SLA on UKCloud for VMware? UKCloud monitors three main components of the UKCloud for VMware service to provide the best overall measure of service availability. The first component is the physical host server that the VM is running on. This confirms that the VM has resources and can be available. The second component is the data store which ensures that the storage associated with the VM is accessible. The last component monitored is the UKCloud for VMware API (available on the UKCloud Portal ) which you may use to programmatically control your UKCloud for VMware environment. By monitoring these three components, UKCloud believes that we can provide the best overall view of the availability of the service. How do you monitor the availability of the physical servers? UKCloud will monitor the underlying physical servers every minute using internal systems and tools to verify that the server is responsive and available. How are the UKCloud for VMware data store(s) monitored? UKCloud monitors the UKCloud for VMware data stores every minute using internal systems and tools to verify the status of the UKCloud for VMware storage. Do you offer an SLA on the UKCloud-provided virtual firewall? Virtual firewalls are covered by the UKCloud management plane (IaaS layer or below) SLA. Customers can claim service credits for affected VMs in the event of an outage, where the fault is within UKCloud-controlled components. Further details are available in the SLA definition . Does UKCloud offer an SLA covering the performance of a VM or its storage? No, UKCloud does not offer an SLA covering the performance of the VM or its storage. However, server capacity and resources are managed by UKCloud to ensure you receive a consistent level of service. How many credits would I receive if there was an SLA Event? This would depend on how long the service was unavailable for and the Service Level selected when the VM was purchased. For example, if an SLA Event occurs and the percentage availability falls below the commitment stated in your SLA, then UKCloud will offer you a Service Credit as a percentage of the total amount billed during the month for the VM affected. Do I receive a Service Credit if the VM is turned off during an SLA Event? No, you will only receive a Service Credit if the service provided was affected. For example, the VM was powered on. Can you give me a worked example for the UKCloud for VMware SLA? Example factors Total hours in January = 744 Cost of a VM per hour = £1.00 Availability Commitment = 99.95% Service Credit Payment = 5% Service Credit Payment cap = 5% Scenario - A VM is running and available for the month of January except for a two-hour period when the service is deemed unavailable. Are Service Credits applicable? Total minutes in the month = 44,640 Total minutes service available = 44,520 The two-hour outage means Percentage Availability of service is 99.73% which is below the Availability Commitment of 99.95% - the customer is therefore eligible for a Service Credit. How much is payable? The bill for the customer at the end of the month would be £742 (before credits are applied) The Service Credit is 5% of the amount billed to that VM during the calendar month = £37.10 The amount billed to the customer is therefore £742 - £37.10 = £704.90 UKCloud for OpenStack How do you offer an SLA on UKCloud for OpenStack? UKCloud monitors three main components of the compute services within CNI to provide the best overall measure of service availability. The first component is the physical host server that instances are running on, this confirms that instances have resources and can be available. The second component is the data store which ensures that the storage associated with instances is accessible. The last component monitored is the control plane API which you may use to programmatically control your UKCloud for OpenStack environment. By monitoring these three components, UKCloud believes that we can provide the best overall view of the availability of the service. How do you monitor the availability of the physical servers? UKCloud will monitor the underlying physical servers every minute using internal systems and tools to verify that the server is responsive and available. How are the data store(s) monitored? UKCloud monitors the data stores every minute using internal systems and tools to verify the status of UKCloud for OpenStack storage services. Does UKCloud offer an SLA covering the performance of an instance or its storage? No, UKCloud does not offer an SLA covering the performance of instances or their storage. However, platform capacity and resources are managed by UKCloud to ensure you receive a consistent level of service. How many credits would I receive if there was an SLA Event? The calculation of service credits will also depend upon whether a customer has engineered their solution to utilise multiple availability zones and regions. For example, if an SLA Event occurs and the percentage availability falls below the commitment stated in your SLA, then UKCloud will offer you a Service Credit as a percentage of the total amount billed during the month for the instances affected. Do I receive a Service Credit if the instance is turned off during an SLA Event? No, you will only receive a Service Credit if the service provided was affected. For example, the instance was turned on. Can you give me a worked example for the UKCloud for OpenStack SLA? Example factors Total hours in January = 744 Cost of an instance per hour = £1.00 Availability Commitment - Data plane = 99.95% Availability Commitment -- Control plane = 99.95% Scenario A - An instance is running as part of a globally deployed solution and available for the month of January except for a two-hour period when the data plane is deemed unavailable. Are Service Credits applicable? Total minutes in the month = 44,640 Total minutes service available = 44,520 The two-hour outage means Percentage Availability of service is 99.73% which is below the Availability Commitment of 99.95% - the customer is therefore eligible for a Service Credit. How much is payable? The bill for the customer at the end of the month would be £744 (before credits are applied) The Service Credit is 10% of the amount billed to that instance during the calendar month = £74.40 The amount billed to the customer is therefore £744 - £74.40 = £669.60 Scenario B - An instance is running within a single region and available for the month of January except for a two-hour period when the data plane is deemed unavailable. Are Service Credits applicable? Total minutes in the month = 44,640 Total minutes service available = 44,520 The two-hour outage means Percentage Availability of service is 99.73% which is below the Availability Commitment of 99.95% - the customer is therefore eligible for a Service Credit. How much is payable? The bill for the customer at the end of the month would be £744 (before credits are applied) The Service Credit is 2% of the amount billed to that instance during the calendar month = £14.88 The amount billed to the customer is therefore £744 - £74.40 = £729.12 Cloud Storage Does UKCloud offer an SLA covering the durability of data stored? No. UKCloud only offers an SLA covering the availability of the service, not the durability of the data. How do you monitor the availability of Cloud Storage for the STANDARD Service Level? UKCloud performs a synthetic transaction that mimics a user authenticating and the \"posting\" of data on to the platform. An SLA Event will be deemed to have occurred and the service deemed unavailable (specifically, a failure of storage hosts and authentication sub-system) if the monitoring fails for five consecutive minutes. How do you monitor the availability of Cloud Storage for ENHANCED and ENHANCED Plus? UKCloud performs a synthetic transaction that mimics a user authenticating and the \"posting\" of data on to the platform. An SLA Event will have occurred and the service deemed unavailable (specifically, concurrent failure of storage hosts and authentication sub-system in both data centre locations) if the monitoring fails in both data centres at the same time for five consecutive minutes. Can you give me a worked example for the Cloud Storage SLA? Example factors Total hours in January = 744 Cost of 100GiB of storage per month = £1.00 per hour Availability Commitment = 99.95% Service Credit Payment = 10% Service Credit Payment cap = 10% Scenario - 100GiB of data is stored on the platform at an expected cost of £100 per month, however the UKCloud synthetic transaction monitor fails for two hours so the service is deemed unavailable. Are Service Credits applicable? Total minutes in the month = 44,640 Total minutes service available = 44,520 The two-hour outage means Percentage Availability of Service is 99.73%, which is below the Availability Commitment of 99.95% --- the customer is therefore eligible for a Service Credit. How much is payable? The bill for the customer at the end of the month would be £100 (before credits are applied) The Service Credit is 10% of the amount billed to that VM during the calendar month = £10.00 The amount billed to the Customer is therefore £100 - £10 = £90.00 UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift Does UKCloud offer an SLA covering the durability of data stored? No. UKCloud only offers an SLA covering the availability of the service, not the durability of the data. Data generated by UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift applications should be considered transient; as such any data which requires persistency and durability should be stored in an alternative storage solution such as UKCloud's Cloud Storage. How do you monitor the UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift service? UKCloud monitors the underpinning infrastructure and UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift services to ensure the highest levels of platform availability. In addition, we perform a synthetic transaction that mimics the publication \"push\" of an application which is accessible to a test consumer. An SLA Event will be deemed to have occurred and the service deemed unavailable if the monitoring fails for five consecutive minutes. Can you give me a worked example for UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift SLA? Example factors (Assured Public UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift) Total hours in January = 744 Cost of 100GiB of Application RAM per month £0.10 x 100 = £10.00 per hour £10.00 x 744 = £7,440 per month Availability Commitment = 99.50% Service Credit Payment = 3% of monthly spend Service Credit Payment cap = 3% of monthly spend Scenario - 100GiB of application RAM is consumed on the platform at an expected cost of £7,440 per month, however the UKCloud synthetic transaction monitor fails for five hours so the service is deemed unavailable. Are Service Credits applicable? Total minutes in the month = 44,640 Total minutes service available = 44,340 The five-hour outage means Percentage Availability of Service is 99.33%, which is below the Availability Commitment of 99.50% - the customer is therefore eligible for a Service Credit. How much is payable? The bill for the customer at the end of the month would be £7,440 (before credits are applied) The Service Credit is 3% of the amount billed to that UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift instance during the calendar month = £223.20 The amount billed to the Customer is therefore £7,440 - £223.20= £7,216.80 UKCloud for Oracle Software Important This service is no longer available for sale. The following information is provided to support existing customers of the service only. How do you offer an SLA on UKCloud for Oracle Software? UKCloud monitors two main components of the UKCloud for Oracle Software service to provide the best overall measure of service availability. The first component is the physical host server that the Oracle Virtual Machine (OVM) is running on. This confirms that the OVM has resources and can be available. The second component is the data store which ensures that the storage associated with the OVM is accessible. By monitoring these two components, UKCloud believes that we can provide the best overall view of the availability of the service. How do you monitor the availability of the physical servers? UKCloud will monitor the underlying physical servers every minute using internal systems and tools to verify that the server is responsive and available. How are the Compute data store(s) monitored? UKCloud monitors the Oracle data stores every minute using internal systems and tools to verify the status of the UKCloud for Oracle Software storage. Does UKCloud offer an SLA covering the performance of an OVM or its storage? No, UKCloud does not offer an SLA covering the performance of the OVM or its storage. However, server capacity and resources are managed by UKCloud to ensure you receive a consistent level of service. How many credits would I receive if there was an SLA Event? This would depend on how long the service was unavailable for and the Service Level selected when the OVM was purchased. For example, if an SLA Event occurs and the percentage availability falls below the commitment stated in your SLA, then UKCloud will offer you a Service Credit as a percentage of the total amount billed during the month for the OVM affected. Do I receive a Service Credit if the OVM is turned off during an SLA Event? No, you will only receive a Service Credit if the service provided was affected i.e. the OVM was turned on. Do you offer an SLA on the UKCloud-provided virtual firewall? Virtual firewalls are covered by the UKCloud management plane SLA. Customers can claim service credits for affected VMs in the event of an outage, where the fault is within UKCloud-controlled components. Further details are available in the SLA definition . Can you give me a worked example for the UKCloud for Oracle Software SLA? Example factors Total hours in January = 744 Cost of a VM per hour = £1.00 Availability Commitment = 99.95% Service Credit Payment = 10% Scenario - A VM is running and available for the month of January except for a two-hour period when the service is deemed unavailable. Are Service Credits applicable? Total minutes in the month = 44,640 Total minutes service available = 44,520 The two-hour outage means Percentage Availability of service is 99.73% which is below the Availability Commitment of 99.95% - the customer is therefore eligible for a Service Credit. How much is payable? The bill for the customer at the end of the month would be £742 (before credits are applied) The Service Credit is 10% of the amount billed to that VM during the calendar month = £74.20 The amount billed to the customer is therefore £742 - £74.20 = £667.80 Email and Collaboration as a Service Important This service is no longer available for sale. The following information is provided to support existing customers of the service only. How do you offer an SLA on Email and Collaboration as a Service? Unavailability applies to existing mailboxes that become unresponsive due to a fault recognised at the SaaS layer or below. That is, the fault is within UKCloud-controlled components, such as the messaging infrastructure, storage, power or internal networking (such as physical firewalls and routers). What is not included in the SLA? The following are examples of what is not covered by the SLA: Faults within your control, such as client applications and mailbox configuration Faults within external connectivity providers (for example DDoS protected internet, PSN, Janet or HSCN) and components collocated at UKCloud Can you give me a worked example for the Email and Collaboration as a Service SLA? Example factors (Email and Collaboration as a Service) Cost of 5,000 mailboxes all using 2GiB and archiving 1GiB, on Assured and using DDoS-protected internet as connectivity, per month Price per month + storage + archived + connectivity = total price per month £3.50 + (5,000 x £1.00) + (5,000 x £0.34) + £0.00 = £6,703.50 per month Availability Commitment = 99.99% Service Credit Payment = 10% of monthly spend for every 5% below SLA target Scenario - 5,000 mailboxes all using 2GiB of storage and archiving 1GiB, on Assured and using the DDoS-protected internet, at an expected cost of £6,703.50 per month. However, the UKCloud service monitoring reports unavailability for 2 days. Are Service Credits applicable? Total days in the month = 30 Total days service available = 28 The 1-day outage means Percentage Availability of Service is 93%, which is below the Availability Commitment of 99.99% - the customer is, therefore, eligible for a Service Credit. How much is payable? The bill for the customer at the end of the month would be £6,703.50 (before credits are applied) The Service Credit is 10% of the amount billed for the amount used on Email and Collaboration as a Service during the calendar month = £670.35 The amount billed to the Customer is, therefore, £6,703.50 - £670.35 = £6,033.10 Feedback If you find a problem with this article, click Improve this Doc to make the change yourself or raise an issue in GitHub.

    "keywords": "Best practice customer guide Overview At UKCloud, we strive to ensure that our products deliver the most value to your business. To help us to achieve this, we've created this guide with useful information to ensure good performance from our products and other helpful advice. Best Practices - UKCloud for VMware This section provides some best practices to ensure you get the most out of UKCloud for VMware. Removing out of date snapshots A VMware snapshot is a way to make a point in time copy of your VM and is useful if you want to preserve the state of your virtual machine so you can repeatedly return to the same state. You should remove snapshots that are no longer needed within 24-48 hours. If snapshots aren't removed, this can cause the following issues: Depending on the size of the snapshot, it may delay the time it takes your virtual machine to power on Snapshot back-ups are likely to fail You may be billed for additional storage due to the size of the snapshot To reduce this potential impact, ensure that you remove any old snapshots within 48 hours once they are no longer needed. For more information, see the following articles: Virtual machine disk limits and considerations and Snapshot Protection FAQs . Resolving failed backups There are many reasons why a back-up may fail. The main occurrences are where the VM is over 2TB or where a database has a high change rate. Occasionally, the VM may not be suitable for this type of backup. If your backups have failed three times within a 14-day period, our engineers will be in touch to make you aware and discuss troubleshooting options. For more information, see the following articles: Snapshot Protection Service Scope and Snapshot Protection FAQs . Creating affinity rules Affinity and anti-affinity rules determine if VMs are kept together as they are moved around within an environment. Affinity rules keep VMs together on the same host Anti-affinity rules ensure that VMs are distributed across different hosts For example, if it is important that your application has very low latency, you can create affinity rules to make sure that the application's VMs are always kept on the same host. If you want your application to be robust in the event of host failures, you can create anti‑affinity rules to spread the VMs across multiple hosts. If you're considering setting affinity rules, please be aware of the impact this may have if a host becomes unavailable at any time. For information on affinity and anti-affinity rules, see How to use affinity and anti-affinity rules . Enabling firewalls At UKCloud, we take the security of your data very seriously and want to make sure that your data is never at risk from being compromised. If your firewall is disabled for any reason, your data may become compromised and open to potential attack. We strongly recommend that you ensure that your firewalls are always enabled and that your source traffic has been specified to meet your security requirements. For more information on ensuring your firewalls are enabled, see How to create firewall rules . Backing up edge gateway configuration If you want to export your edge gateway configuration data (firewall rules, NAT rules, load balancer virtual servers and DHCP pools), for example, for backup or disaster recovery purposes, you can use PowerShell. If you do not export your edge configuration data before redeployment of an edge, you will not be able to roll back to a previous version if the redeployment is unsuccessful. For more information, see How to export vCNS Edge configuration data using PowerShell . Capturing edge gateway logs VMware logs can be a useful way of identifying a root cause for an issue and troubleshooting. These logs can only be viewed by our engineers at UKCloud and cannot be accessed through the UKCloud Portal. If an edge is redeployed, these logs will be deleted and cannot be recovered. If you'd like to retain your VMware logs and are planning to redeploy an edge, raise a ticket requesting these logs. Allow two days for this request to be completed. Setting up syslog collection Your edge gateway is globally configured to send syslog messages to a specific IP address. By configuring a new network or IP address within your virtual data centre (VDC) and deploying a collector with the syslog IP address, you can access your edge gateway syslog data. You can then use this data to check: Allowed and denied network traffic Load balancer statistics Load balancer health For more information, see How to access syslog data for your edge gateway . Choosing the appropriate compute sizing At UKCloud, we're proud to provide a range of products, solutions and pricing tailored to suit the needs of your business. We've designed our compute 't-shirt' sizes with the optimum level of RAM and CPU to deliver ideal performance. However, if these levels are increased, this may degrade performance over time. For more information on the range of VM sizes that we offer, see our latest UKCloud Pricing Guide . Best Practices - general information Maintaining up-to-date contacts for your account In the event of an incident, it's important that we have the correct contact details for you. Ensure that: Your account has two nominated administrators. The administrator has access rights to create and set up new users and reset passwords. In the event of an incident, our support team will always contact the administrator first to resolve the issue. Your contact details are up to date. Please review account permissions regularly when people leave your business or change roles to ensure they are correct There are contact details listed for both primary and secondary technical contacts. We proactively create support tickets for these contacts when an action is required in your environment so it's important these are up to date. If you're already a nominated administrator and would like to set up an additional administrator or make changes to any contacts, you can do so via the Contacts option in the UKCloud Portal. Subscribing to platform updates To provide you with the latest information on the availability and overall health of our platforms, we have set-up the UKCloud Service Status page . This page shows the status of our services and connections, split by region and zone, and details of Planned Maintenance. To subscribe to updates, at the bottom of the page, click Subscribe , enter your email address then select the services you're interested in. You'll receive an email confirming your subscription to the status page; be sure to click Verify to ensure you'll receive updates on your selected services. For more information on finding the region and zone, see How to locate your virtual data centre on the UKCloud platform . If you're experiencing issues that aren't reflected on the status page, please contact us through the UKCloud Portal . Locating your VDCs UKCloud provides information about the location of a VDC in the VDC metadata. Using this metadata, you can locate a VDC by site, region and zone. Knowing where your VDCs are located can be useful for: Determining how resilient your applications are Determining how maintenance or an unplanned outage may affect your applications Providing additional information to help with support call resolution More detailed billing information per VM For more information, see How to locate your virtual data centre on the UKCloud platform . Renewing, adding and revoking SRA certificates Secure Remote Access (SRA) certificates enable you to securely connect to UKCloud's Elevated OFFICIAL security domain using NCSC-approved internet virtual private network (VPN) technologies and the walled garden architectural pattern. System administrators and mobile workers can securely access workloads running on Elevated OFFICIAL from locations that don't have alternative secure network connections such as PSN or HSCN. SRA certificates last for 12 months. You'll need to renew certificates no later than two weeks before the certificates expire to avoid any interruption to your service. To add additional certificates, raise a service request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal, selecting the Request Additional SRAS Certificate(s) option. To renew or revoke your certificate, raise a service request via the UKCloud Portal, selecting the Renew and/or Revoke SRAS Certificate option. For renewals, it's important you give us at least two weeks' notice to prevent a break in your service. If you have multiple certificates to renew or revoke, you can do this in a single service request by selecting the Renew and/or Revoke multiple SRAS Certificates option in the UKCloud Portal. Attach the Secure Remote Access bulk renewal/revoke form containing all the certificates. For more information, see the Secure Remote Access FAQs and Secure Remote Access Service Definition .

    "title": "Cloud economics",
    "keywords": "Cloud Economics Pricing for virtual machines (VMs) provided on UKCloud's multi-cloud platform, is based on actual consumption (per VM, per hour, per GiB per month). It's essential that you base your cloud solution on predicted usage rather than your predicted peak demand. Unlike traditional IT solutions, cloud-based computing can scale depending on workload requirements so you only need to account for standard usage. To help you specify your cloud solution, you should consider the following: What's the ramp up period from zero to full utilisation? If your business-as-usual solution requires 50 servers and your go-live is in six months’ time, it's likely that you might only begin with five servers and then slowly increase the number of servers as you near your go-live date. Do all the servers have to run all the time? As VMs are charged by the hour, you can make significant savings by powering off your VMs when they are not required (for example, overnight or during weekends). Would you benefit from an annual subscription? For those VMs that need to run 24/7, you should consider a 12-month subscription which would mean charges for those VMs will benefit from a discount. See the \"Discount and purchase schemes\" section of the Price Guide for more information on commitment discounts. Some non-production environments may only be required during certain times of the project/year. So if you only need a UAT environment one week per month, be sure to factor that in when estimating your hourly costs. Are your servers right-sized? A significant aspect of cloud computing is self-service; it's very easy to increase the processing, memory or storage resources of your servers. You may want to start small and scale up, as and when you need more capacity, instead of starting big and leaving resources under-utilised as this increases your operating costs. It's also important to note that you can scale down VMs when resource requirements shrink, so you can reduce your hourly costs and avoid wastage. Additionally, some customers may prefer to have a higher number of smaller sized VMs working in a cluster for redundancy and load balancing, rather than a smaller number of large expensive VMs. Do you need those redundant VMs? Our platform offers inherent resilience to mitigate hardware failure and even site failure. Be sure that you need redundancy at the application layer before you add in the additional cost by provisioning redundant VMs. Do you need dedicated blades to comply with application licensing requirements? UKCloud offers a variety of service deployment options for compute resources to ensure they meet licensing standards. Many popular applications can be licensed on our multi-tenant platform. However, some applications need to run on dedicated environments to limit cost and remain compliant.

    "href": "articles/other/other-ref-discount-schemes.html",
    "title": "UKCloud discount and purchase schemes",
    "keywords": "UKCloud discount and purchase schemes Overview UKCloud provides several discount and purchase schemes. Commitment discount Customers commit to spending a specific minimum amount each month for a minimum of 12 months. The discount level attained is based on the total spend committed for the 12 months. To achieve the discount, the customer will fix a value that they will commit to spend for each month of the term. This must be in a single purchase order (PO) with each month as a separate line item. As customers can consume more than their committed amount each month, they must also add an additional line item and value to cover any overspend. This must be part of the same PO. If the customer has an existing contract, they need to accept a Contract Change Notice and set the values as outlined above. If multiple contracts are affected, any changes will be made via a Side Letter. PO value Discount level <£250K 0% £250K-£499K 9% £500K-£749K 13% £750K-£1,499K 16% £1,500K+ 19% Individual projects or departments (billing entities associated with each monthly spend) can be amended during the year through discussion with, and agreement from, UKCloud; however, the committed value cannot be reduced midterm. Customers get a discounted rate for each month, up to the set monthly figure only, not for overuse. At the end of each month, UKCloud will do one of two things: If the actual usage is above the committed value, UKCloud will take the value from the monthly commitment line item and the remaining balance from the overspend line item. If the actual usage is below the set value, UKCloud will bill the customer the committed value. At the end of the 12 months, UKCloud will rebate the value of the applicable discount over the 12-month period minus any overuse for the last month; so, the invoice for month 12 is for the committed consumption plus any overuse at standard prices, with the potential for a 12-month rebate. If the overspend PO line item value is spent before the end of the 12 months, the customer must issue a top-up PO value for the remainder of the 12 months, or increase their spend and commit to a further 12 months. The customer will pay for any usage above the set amount at the standard rates. The discount is set based on the committed PO value, not the actual usage. Annual subscription discount This discount scheme is aimed at customers who consistently utilise a number of virtual machines (VMs) that are running 24x7 throughout the year. Customers can gain a discount off the standard rates by subscribing to pay for VMs for a minimum 12-month period, and UKCloud will take the discount off the annualised hourly cost of the VM, which is payable in 12 equal monthly payments, regardless of actual usage. Subscription period Discount level 12 months 9% Customers must specify the quantity of VMs (by VM size and service level) they want to subscribe to, and there is no minimum level. The UKCloud billing system will automatically offset the cost of VMs that exactly match the size and service level of the specified VMs. All other VMs and ancillary services (additional storage to subscribed VMs) will be billed at standard UKCloud rates. Annual subscription discount worked example (UKCloud for VMware) If you know you'll consume a minimum of 20 Large ESSENTIAL VMs on the Assured OFFICIAL security domain for at least a year, you can make an annual subscription to those 20 VMs and receive an effective 9% discount. A Large ESSENTIAL VM on Assured costs £0.18 per hour, therefore £1,576.80 per year (£0.18 x 24 hours per day x 354 days), so 20 of these VMs would usually cost £31,536 per year. If you subscribe to these 20 VMs for a year, you'll get a 9% discount (£2,838.24), reducing the annual cost to £28,697.76, billed at £2,391.48 per month. In months where you use less that 20 VMs, you'll still be billed at £2,391.48. In months where you use more than 20 VMs, the additional VMs will be billed at standard UKCloud rates. Cloud Credits You can purchase Cloud Credits upfront and redeem them against our cloud services over a maximum two-year period. This enables organisations to effectively commit their CAPEX or budget spend in advance, with monthly usage deducted from the balance until depleted. Every £1 spent on Cloud Credits equals £1 to be spent on our cloud services. The purchase of Cloud Credits can be made against any Service Definition and Cloud Credits are transferable between services. Cloud Credits can be used for a single service or a combination of services or orders. Any unused Cloud Credits at the end of the two-year period will be non-refundable. Cloud Credits worked example If, based on previous or projected usage, you know you'll consume at least £550,000 worth of cloud services over a two-year period, you may choose to pre-pay this amount. You'll receive £550,000 worth of Cloud Credits to be used against any UKCloud service over a maximum two-year period. You'll receive a monthly invoice, with payment automatically taken from your Cloud Credits, if available. You'll need to inform our Finance department if you want to make any amendments to how your invoices are paid.

You have access to copy or export your data at any point in life working with UKCloud and further options may exist that are not covered here. Before you begin You can package and export your data in a number of different ways, however we recommend that you read the following documents: How to use the VMware OVF Tool - Provides guidance on using the OVF tool, which you can use to export data from VMware Getting Started Guide for Cloud Storage - Covers the use of APIs for accessing our storage service Exporting data You can use any of the following methods to export data: Internet, government secure network or leased line data copy Data Transfer Facility (self-service) Mass Transfer Facility (UKCloud) Customer-hosted equipment Internet, government secure network or leased line data copy All customers have some form of connectivity to the UKCloud platform to consume services, whether that be an internet facing connection or through one of the approved or government secure network connections. These connections are used for the management of services and may also have been used for copying data to the UKCloud platform. Therefore, the first option for exporting data is to make use of these existing connections. Data Transfer Facility (self-service) If you want to make use of UKCloud's facilities, we maintain a data room where you can access both the Assured and Elevated security domains by appointment. Your staff or assigned representatives can attend site for a pre-booked number of days and copy data to the provided machines, with the expectation that this data is then moved onto removable media, for example USB hard disks, to be transported. For more information about booking and using this service, see the Data Transfer Facility Service Scope . Mass Transfer Facility (UKCloud) Similar to the Data Transfer Facility, this option copies data from your environment to, typically, removable media provided by you.

    "title": "External security review testing",
    "keywords": "External security review testing Overview All UKCloud services, and their underlying infrastructure are suitable for supporting OFFICIAL and OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE data. We achieve this via a robust risk management system that meets stringent requirements and best practice industry standards. We also complete a comprehensive IT Security Health Check of the entire infrastructure, undertaken by an external assessment organisation, on a regular basis. UKCloud has implemented all 14 NCSC Cloud Security Principles. However, to ensure that you're able to meet your own legislative, regulatory and/or contractual requirements, UKCloud provides a service to assist you in undertaking appropriate security reviews of the services above the underlying platform. In this way, we'll co-operate with reasonable requests in arranging, conducting and reviewing the results of such reviews and/or tests. Important Within the terms and conditions of the service, you (and any third parties or agents you engage) must treat any results or information of these tests as confidential, safeguard it accordingly and not disclose any confidential information belonging to the other party. Further, any activities or testing performed outside of the agreed scope will be treated as malicious and/or unauthorised activity, which may result in a breach of contract, service cessation and legal consequences. If you have any questions relating to UKCloud's policies and procedures in place to mitigate risk within the underlying platform, contact us for further information. Confidential information includes, but is not limited to all commercial, marketing, financial, technical, security, personnel, operational and similar information, including trade secrets, \"know how\", brand marks, trademarks and other proprietary information. This article provides useful information for undertaking appropriate security reviews of your services above the underlying UKCloud platform. It highlights the notice requirement for performing penetration tests, and steps through the process for arranging the testing. Service scope As above, the underlying technology platform supporting UKCloud's services and customer management tools, for example the UKCloud Portal, are fully tested for our Assured and Elevated security domains. You will therefore be testing from a cloud consumer rather than a cloud management perspective. For example, within UKCloud for VMware, the platform extends to the perimeter of the your vCloud organisation with the edge gateway acting as the boundary. The diagram below shows that the edge gateway, along with everything to the right, is your responsibility and can be included within the scope of your security test. Engagement and operation of tests UKCloud will cooperate with you to support external penetration testing requirements, subject to four (4) working days' notice being given as long as the following activities have been completed. Note If testing is to be conducted in both Assured and Elevated security domains, you must complete separate requests for each system. To request permission to perform a test, you must: In the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal, raise a ticket using the ESRT / Pen Test template. Tip You can find the ESRT / Pen Test template under UKCloud Generic Services or search for it using the Search for a Request Offering field. On the Customer and Contact Details page, select the UKCloud Service for which you want to perform the test. Enter the details of two people to act as points of contact for the testing, then click Continue . On the Testing Scope page, select the Environment ID of the environment in which you'll be performing the test. Tip If the list doesn't include any IDs, you can enter the environment ID in the Additional Details field. In the IPs to be tested field, enter the external IP addresses to access the environments that you want to include in the test. In the Start Date/Time fields indicate when you plan to start your testing. In the End Date/Time fields, indicate when you plan to complete your testing. In the Additional Details field, enter any other information that you think would be useful, then click Continue . On the Testing Organisation page, enter contact details for the organisation that will be completing the testing. In the Source IP Address for Tests field, enter the IP address from which the testing will originate, then click Continue . On the Testing Conditions page, thoroughly review the terms and conditions of the service, and if you're happy, accept the conditions and then click Continue . Review your selections, then click Submit . Note If you want to share any other relevant information (for example, a formal scope), you can attach this to your Service Request. On receipt of the Service Request, UKCloud will review the submission at the next possible Change Advisory Board (CAB) and provide an update in the Service Request, either: Where the request is approved, to convey technical authority to proceed with the test at the date and time specified, and in accordance with the documented testing scope. Where the request is not approved, to convey the result and the reasons for it, enabling you to decide whether to withdraw or resubmit the request. Testing access points You may test from two locations: External (from outside the virtual environment) – Tests are to be carried out external to the UKCloud data centres and offices from the perspective of the internet or government networks. For example for UKCloud for VMware, these tests will traverse UKCloud's physical network edge, and enter your vCloud organisation through the edge gateway. Internal (from inside the virtual environment) – Tests are to be carried out external to the UKCloud data centres and offices from the perspective of the internet or government networks. It is expected that you would provision a virtual machine (VM) or instance within your environment (which will be billed under as normal consumption) to act as a launch-pad for testing. Any testers would then upload relevant tools to this VM to execute tests within your organisation. Pricing For a test to commence, UKCloud must complete a number of administrative tasks to facilitate the activity. This may result in a cost, chargeable as one day's work from the SFIA Rate Card (Level 4 - Enable). In some circumstances, additional time may be required but this will be outlined prior to tests commencing.

    "title": "Understanding the difference between GB and GiB",
    "keywords": "Understanding the difference between GB and GiB Overview This article explains why an operating system can report a different disk drive capacity to that specified by the vendor of the drive. UKCloud charges per GiB, rather than per GB, to ensure that you only pay for what you actually use. This article provides information about disk capacity and explains when viewed by an operating system, why the capacity of a drive differs from what is reported by a vendor. Why is this important? When purchasing disk drives, 1 GB is often defined as 1,000,000,000 bytes. However, when viewed by an operating system, the capacity displayed is often less than this. For example, a new 1 TB hard drive would be reported by the OS as 931 GB (this is 931 GiB). GiB (Gibibytes) is a standard unit used in the field of data processing and transmission and is defined as base 1024 rather than base 1000. For example, 1 GB is defined as 1000³ bytes, whereas 1 GiB is defined as 1024³ bytes. Unit of measure Bytes Kilobyte (KB) 1000¹ = 1,000 Megabyte (MB) 1000² = 1,000,000 Gigabyte (GB) 1000³ = 1,000,000,000 Terabyte (TB) 1000⁴ = 1,000,000,000,000 Petabyte (PB) 1000⁵ = 1,000,000,000,000,000 Kibibyte (KiB) 1024¹ = 1,024 Mebibyte (MiB) 1024² = 1,048,576 Gibibyte (GiB) 1024³ = 1,073,741,824 Tebibyte (TiB) 1024⁴ = 1,099,511,627,776 Pebibyte (PiB) 1024⁵ = 1,125,899,906,842,624 How is this converted? GB to GiB Multiply by (1000³ / 1024³), equivalent to 0.931323 Divide by this value to go from GiB to GB TB to TiB Multiply by (1000⁴ / 1024⁴), equivalent to 0.909495 Divide by this value to go from TiB to TB GiB to TiB Divide by 1024 Multiply by 1024 to go from TiB to GiB GiB to TB Convert into GB by dividing by 0.931323, then divide by 1000 to get into TB Examples of conversions 1 GB = 0.93 GiB 1 TB = 0.91 TiB = 931 GiB 1 TiB = 1.1 TB = 1100 GB Full worked example Example customer has two disks in each server, with each disk capacity being 2.2 TB SSD. Therefore, the total drive size equals 4.4 TB or 4.001777 TiB which across 100 hosts would mean the capacity totals 440 TB or 400.1777 TiB. The monthly charge would therefore be 400.1777 TiB, which when multiplied by 1024 to convert into GiB is 409,781.9 GiB. At a rate of 10p/GiB, the monthly charge would be £40,978.19 per month, equating to £409.78 per server. To illustrate the difference between GiB and GB, if we charged at a rate of 10p/GB (instead of GiB) then you would be charged for 440,000 GB which equates to a total cost of £44,000 or £440 per server. This provides a significant price difference of £3,121.81 per month, a 7.6% increase in cost. By pricing our services at £/GiB you will be charged for around 93% of the total cost had prices been listed per GB.

We recommend that you couple this with deploying your services into multiple sites to ensure that your services are available via different RIPE IP addresses (ideally on different IP network ranges). PSN/HSCN/Janet Redundant, high-speed connectivity with automatic failover. No additional services are required to ensure high availability. We recommend that you couple this with deploying your services into multiple sites to ensure that your services are available. HybridConnect Enables you to bring your own secure connectivity into the UKCloud environment. We provide colocation services for hardware and can assist in the design. We recommend that you deploy an additional HybridConnect service in another site to ensure that you have redundant connectivity into a second site. We recommend that you use routing protocols to enable automated failover. Supplementary services for high availability In addition to the high-availability features provided as-standard on our platform, we also offer the following additional services: High-availability consideration Notes Neustar UltraDNS from UKCloud Enables you to load balance inbound connections to your services and perform health checking. If one site becomes unavailable, users are automatically redirected to an alternative available location. Neustar DDoS Protection from UKCloud A fully-managed DDoS protection solution backed by an industry-leading Security Operations Team that scrubs your website's malicious traffic - delivering only clean, legitimate traffic to your site. Disaster Recovery as a Service A powerful, self-service replication and recovery tool that can improve organisational resilience and enable seamless migration of applications between your local VMware or Hyper-V powered data centre and the UKCloud platform. Replicated backup Enables your services to be backed up and the backup data replicated to another site. Cloud Storage Enables you to take regular backups of your database data (or transaction data) to meet your specific Recovery Point Objective (RPO). Professional Services Our multi-cloud experts can assess your cloud environment and help you ensure its availability. Application design considerations If you're designing your application specifically for the cloud, we recommend reviewing the 12-factor cloud application design model . There are some high-level considerations to think about when deploying to a cloud environment. Service High-availability consideration Web services Utilise an N+1 model, either with multiple web servers running underneath a load balancer or reverse proxy, or with at least one web server running in hot standby. Also use this approach in conjunction with Neustar UltraDNS from UKCloud to deliver multi-site resilience. Application services As per web services, utilize an N+1 model. Inter-service messaging Utilise a resilient message queuing architecture to handle messages between services. This enables messages to be load balanced between sites. It also means that messages are not lost in the event of a server crash and restart. Databases Every database has a high availability option. We recommend that you adopt an N+1 clustered database model (but avoid shared disk architectures), in conjunction with sharding or asynchronous replication technologies, to create a replica of this database in another location. Data Make sure you take a copy of your application or database data at appropriate intervals to meet your Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and store the copy somewhere outside your current site. UKCloud for Microsoft Azure In UKCloud for Microsoft Azure, you can use availability sets to spread VMs across multiple fault domains and update domains. In the event of downtime in one domain due to a hardware failure or Planned Maintenance, VMs in the affected domain are restarted in another domain. For more information, see High Availability . A load balancer spreads incoming requests across multiple VMs, helping with scale and availability. For more information, see How to create a load balancer using the UKCloud Azure Stack Hub portal . With Azure Site Recovery, you can replicate a VM to a different region for disaster recovery. For more information, see How to deploy an Azure Site Recovery template to Azure Stack Hub using PowerShell . Use SQL Always On to ensure the availability of SQL server. For more information, see How to deploy an SQL template to Azure Stack Hub using PowerShell . UKCloud for OpenStack OpenStack Platform 13 (OSP13) provides Load Balancing-as-a-Service (LBaaS) as a native feature. For more information see the Load Balancing-as-a-Service (LBaaS) with Octavia chapter of the OpenStack Networking Guide. To improve the resilience of your UKCloud for OpenStack applications, you can move resources (for example, instance images and volumes) between the different regions currently offered by UKCloud. For more information, see How to move resources between OpenStack regions . UKCloud monitors UKCloud for OpenStack at regular intervals, checking for issues with the hardware or software services supporting the service. When a host experiences problems, our engineers take steps to live migrate any instances on the affected host to an alternative one. For information about how this works and how you can control what happens when a host is migrated, see How to manage how your instance recovers from a host failure . To help your applications cope with variable demand, you can configure Orchestration (HEAT) to automatically add and remove instances as needed. For more information, see Auto Scaling for UKCloud for OpenStack . UKCloud for Oracle Software Important This service is no longer available for sale. The following information is provided to support existing customers of the service only. In UKCloud for Oracle Software, you can enable HA on a virtual machine so that it can be automatically migrated to a surviving node in the event of a failure. For more information, see How to enable high availability for your Oracle VMs . If your VM is running an Oracle database and you're using hard partitioning to reduce licensing costs, virtual CPUs are pinned to physical cores and the HA option is not available. In the event of a failure, VMs must be manually migrated to a new host and will require restarting. To achieve high availability for your Oracle database, you can use Real Application Clusters to share the database across multiple servers. For more information, see RAC on UKCloud for Oracle Software . UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift Each OpenShift cluster is deployed in a single UKCloud region. To achieve region-level resilience, we recommend having a cluster in at least two separate regions, utilizing a global load balancer or DNS failover service (such as the one from Neustar UltraDNS from UKCloud) to ensure traffic is redirected should a region or cluster level availability issue occur. We also offer the option to have the Portworx storage solution configured in your cluster by UKCloud during deployment. This enables further resilience for your applications by offering highly-available storage, which significantly reduces container failover times, adds multi-attach storage to enable multiple containers to read/write the same volume on different nodes and the ability to replicate and migrate workloads between clusters to aid disaster recovery. Within each OpenShift cluster deployment there are a number of features that support high availability and resilience: Each OpenShift cluster is deployed with at least three master nodes responsible for the availability of the cluster API, etcd and other core components. Ingress traffic comes via resilient UKCloud managed load balancers into the cluster. It enters the cluster via resilient router pods deployed on the OpenShift infrastructure nodes. We recommend always having more than one application node deployed in each cluster. If you only have one node for your application containers, a single host failure could affect all applications deployed in the cluster as they'd have nowhere to fail over to within the cluster until the node is recovered and returned to service. You should also take measures within the configuration of your applications to ensure they run in a resilient fashion. These measures include running applications at a scale of >1 replicas wherever possible (so multiple pods satisfy the needs of inbound requests) and configuring liveness and readiness checks to aid the platform's understanding of any problematic containers. UKCloud for VMware UKCloud for VMware provides Snapshot Protection as a protection option for your applications. Snapshot Protection automatically takes an image of your VMs every 24 hours and stores the image outside the core platform for either 14 or 28 days. For more information, see How to manage Snapshot Protection for your VMs . As an alternative to Snapshot Protection, you could consider Journaling Protection, a powerful self-service protection option, powered by Zerto, that protects your applications by replicating them to another zone. For more information, see the Getting Started Guide for Journaling Protection . The edge gateway for your VDC provides basic load balancing functionality to help distribute traffic. For more information, see How to configure a load balancer . However, for more complex requirements, you'll need to provide your own third-party virtual load balancer. Affinity and anti-affinity rules determine whether or not VMs are kept together as they are move around within your environment. If you want your applications to be robust in the event of host failures, you can create anti-affinity rules to make sure that when VMs are moved, they remain spread across multiple hosts. For more information, see How to use affinity and anti‑affinity rules . For information about the data recovery options available for different use cases, see Virtual machine data recovery options . IPsec site-to-site VPN provides a secure way to share resources across multiple locations. For more information, see How to configure IPsec VPN . Alternatively, L2 VPN, available as part of the UKCloud for VMware Advanced Management bundle, enables you to stretch the same Layer 2 broadcast domain over an SSL tunnel across two edge gateways in different sites, meaning that you can extend your data centre across multiple sites and move your workloads seamlessly between them. For more information, see How to configure an L2 VPN . Cloud Storage We offer our Cloud Storage service at different service levels dependent on your requirements. If you select the STANDARD service level, we strongly recommend that you deploy an additional service in a second site that your application can target if one becomes unavailable. The ENHANCED service level ensures that your data is synchronised across two different sites and that there is a minimum of six effective copies. Cross Domain Security Zone Each Cross Domain Security Zone (CDSZ) service is deployed into only one site so we strongly recommend that you deploy an additional walled garden in a second site to provide an additional cross domain solution that your application can target if one becomes available. We recommend that you implement some form of automated failover solution between your two cross domain solutions. You can deliver this directly within the application, or preferably using some form of load balancing service, such as HAProxy. This enables the application to continue using the cross domain solution services in the event of an issue. For your walled garden, we recommend that you follow standard N+1 availability architectures to enable high availability for the application, as per any standard cloud deployment. Private Cloud By default, the Private Cloud service is deployed to a single site, so we strongly recommend that you use automated site replication and failover to ensure that all data is synced to another site and can still be accessed in the event of a failover. Secure Remote Access Each Secure Remote Access (SRA) service is deployed into only one site so we highly recommend that you deploy an additional SRA service that your end users can target if one becomes unavailable. To facilitate automatic failover of the VPN solution for end users, we recommend the use of a load balancing or DNS failover solution that automatically directs end users to the current functioning endpoint. For the secure VDC that contains the jump boxes or bastion hosts, we recommend that you follow standard N+1 availability architectures to enable high availability for the application, as per any standard IaaS compute deployment.

    "title": "Understanding UKCloud's Identity & Access Management API",
    "keywords": "Understanding UKCloud's Identity & Access Management API UKCloud's Identity & Access Management API (IDAM) enables you to manage user access to products within your account. Adding a user to a group changes which permissions they have. Full documentation for the IDAM API is available on SwaggerHub . Typical usage To add a user to a permission group, you first need to list the users and permission groups to find the IDs for both. Then you can use those IDs to add the user to the appropriate group. Prerequisites This article provides examples using curl and jq . Authentication Before you begin, you'll need to retrieve a single sign-on token to authenticate with IDAM. For ease of use, this is saved to a variable token in your current shell session using the below command. echo \"enter your Portal email address\" read username echo \"enter your Portal password\" read -s password token=$(curl -X POST \"https://idp.ukcloud.com/auth/realms/client-assured/protocol/openid-connect/token\" \\ --data-urlencode \"username=$username\" \\ --data-urlencode \"password=$password\" \\ -d grant_type=password \\ -d client_id=portal.ukcloud | jq -r '.access_token') unset password This token is used in bearer authentication with IDAM. Requests to the IDAM API are prefaced with curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $token\" . Listing users The first step would be to find the ID of the user whose permissions you wish to edit. The below command lists all users you are entitled to manage with their IDs and usernames. Take a note of your target user's ID. curl -s -H \"Authorization: Bearer $token\" https://idam.ukcloud.com/v1/users | jq -r '.[] | .id + \" \" + .username' Listing groups The next step is to find the ID of the permission you would like to give or take from the user. These are known as groups internally to IDAM. The below command lists all groups you are entitled to manage with their IDs and names. curl -s -H \"Authorization: Bearer $token\" https://idam.ukcloud.com/v1/groups | jq -r '.[].subGroups[] | .id + \" \" + .name' Adding a user to a group To give a user a particular permission, use the IDs that you have found to make a request to grant the user that permission. You can add a user to a group with this PUT request. Expect a response code of 204 if this is successful. curl -X PUT -H \"Authorization: Bearer $token\" https://idam.ukcloud.com/v1/users/{{user_id}}/groups/{{group_id}} Removing a user from a group A DELETE request, as opposed to a PUT request, will remove a permission from a user by removing them from a group. You can remove a user from a group with this DELETE request. Expect a response code of 204 if this is successful. curl -X DELETE -H \"Authorization: Bearer $token\" https://idam.ukcloud.com/v1/users/{{user_id}}/groups/{{group_id}} Feedback If you find a problem with this article, click Improve this Doc to make the change yourself or raise an issue in GitHub.

For information about how to contribute content, see How to contribute to the UKCloud Knowledge Centre . Sensitive content Important Content in the Knowledge Centre is publicly available to anyone, therefore it is extremely important to ensure that articles do not contain any sensitive information, including, but not limited to, user names and sensitive IP addresses. This includes information that may be in screenshots or images. If you're unsure about whether information in the article is sensitive, consult with a subject matter expert before submitting your changes. Submission of content By submitting content you're granting UKCloud permission to use your submission in our Knowledge Centre, which is available for public consumption. In addition, you'll also be identified as a contributor to the article in our public GitHub repository. Article file naming conventions Article file names are constructed as follows, with each element separated by a hyphen: <product>-<type>-<description>-<tool>.md where: product indicates which product the topic is for, for example vmw for UKCloud for VMware, conn for Connectivity or ptl for the UKCloud Portal type indicates the article type, for example how for How To Guides, sd for Service Definitions or vid for Videos description indicates the purpose of the article tool (optional) indicates if the topic is specific to a particular tool (for example, a CLI or API) Article metadata Each article includes metadata at the top of the file, which ensures that the article is included properly in the Knowledge Centre and helps with searches. Metadata includes the article title , when it was lastreviewed and categorisation and location within the Knowledge Centre. Article title The first thing in your article after the metadata should be the main article title. Use the following to help you decide on the title for your article: Titles (and all other headings) should use Sentence capitalisation (that is, the first word should start with an uppercase letter and all other words should be all lowercase unless they are proper nouns) Use a single # for the article title, and make sure there's a space after the # How To Guide titles should start with How to and then a verb to describe the task described in the article, for example How to create a virtual machine Reference Guides should start with a noun if possible Generally, you should not include any text below the article title, but should go straight to the first ( Overview ) section. However, if the article is very short and does not require any subheadings, you can include the content directly below the article title. You can also include important notes immediately after the title (for example, product retirement notifications). Article structure Overview section The first section after the article title should be Overview and should provide an introduction to the purpose of the article. Intended audience section For How To Guides, if appropriate, you can include an Intended audience subsection within the Overview section to indicate any particular access or permissions a user might need to complete the steps in the task described by the guide. Prerequisites section For How To Guides, if appropriate, you can include a Prerequisites section after the Overview section to indicate any actions a user might need to complete before the steps detailed by the guide. Further sections Use additional sections to break the article up into manageable chunks to make it easier to read. Section headings should use Sentence capitalisation (that is, the first word should start with an uppercase letter and all other words should be all lowercase unless they are proper nouns). In How To articles, you may just have a single additional section describing the task being described in the article -- you should use gerunds (words ending in -ing) for the section headings. For example Logging into the OpenStack Horizon dashboard . If the article includes multiple tasks, put each task into its own section, but avoid having too many tasks in a single article. Reference Guides can include as many sections as necessary to keep the content easy to read. But don't use too many levels of subsections as it can be difficult for users to keep track of where they are if the subsections go too deep. Next steps section For procedural articles, where possible include a Next steps section after describing the tasks within the article to point users to other articles that might be helpful. Lead into the list of articles by recapping what was covered in the current article. For information about creating links, see Links . Related information sections For reference articles, where possible, include a Related articles and/or Related videos section at the end to provide pointers for what to read next. If there are resources outside of the Knowledge Centre that would be useful to users, for example, vendor articles or web pages, include these in a More information section at the end of the article. For information about creating links, see Links . Feedback section The last section in every article should be the Feedback section. This provides users with information about how to provide feedback to UKCloud on their experience either with the Knowledge Centre or with our platform. The feedback section should include the following text: If you find a problem with this article, click Improve this Doc to make the change yourself or raise an issue in GitHub.

Lists Bulleted lists Bulleted lists are for lists of items where the order doesn't matter. For lists where the items are short, incomplete sentences, you don't need to include a full stop at the end of each item. For longer sentences or multiple sentences, use full stops. But be consistent within each list; if one item in a list needs a full stop, all items that list should end in a full stop. Include an empty line in between each item in the list. Bulleted lists Look like this with sub lists if required Markdown: - Bulleted lists - Look like this - with sub lists - if required Numbered lists Numbered lists are for lists where the order is important. A How To Guide will usually include at least one numbered list. Generally speaking, items in a numbered list will be complete sentences, so they should end with a full stop.

Planned Maintenance Planned Maintenance means any pre-planned disruptive maintenance to any of the infrastructure relating to the service. Planned Maintenance activity may result in periods of degradation or loss of availability, depending on the nature of the activity required. In such cases, UKCloud shall provide affected customers with at least 14 days' notice of the Planned Maintenance. As far as possible, Planned Maintenance shall be planned in such a way to minimise the impact to customers and maximise the amount of work that can be achieved safely. If, during Planned Maintenance, there is a loss of availability outside the scope described in the Planned Maintenance notification to the service, an SLA event will be triggered. For information about whether Planned Maintenance-related SLA events will be included in the availability calculation for a particular service and be eligible for Service Credits, see the SLA definition . Emergency Maintenance Emergency Maintenance means any urgent maintenance required to prevent or mitigate against any event compromising the infrastructure related to the service. Emergency Maintenance may result in periods of degradation or loss of availability, depending on the nature of the activity required.

    "title": "Terminating your UKCloud services",
    "keywords": "Terminating your UKCloud services Overview UKCloud is easy to adopt, easy to use and easy to leave, so our intention is to make the service termination process, sometimes referred to as offboarding or deprovisioning, as simple as possible. This article clearly outlines customer and UKCloud responsibilities for terminating your UKCloud services. Notice requirements The notice required to terminate UKCloud services varies depending on the service. For UKCloud notice period requirements on a per-product basis, refer to Services at a glance . Single service termination vs account termination You can request the termination of one or more services within your account. In this case, the termination is restricted to the chargeable items within that service (for example, a VMware environment within a customer account). If you want to terminate your whole account with UKCloud, you must raise separate termination requests for each service associated with your customer contract. The final stage of the termination of a complete customer account will be the decommissioning of the last UKCloud Portal user, decommissioning of all customer reports and termination of the ability to access customer ticket details through the Portal. Customer responsibilities When you decide to terminate a service, you should first contact your Service Delivery Manager (SDM). Your SDM will help you to determine the relevant environment details for termination and the Effective Date of Termination. After speaking to your SDM, an administrator of your Portal account must raise a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal, following the relevant prompts for information to enable our support team to action the request as quickly as possible. Note If you do not raise a Service Request to initiate a formal termination of service, your environment may not be completely decommissioned and you may end up still being charged for objects remaining on the platform. Before the decommissioning of the services can take place, you are responsible for the removal of all the data within the environment. Refer to Responsibilities by service below for a list of environment items that you need to clear ahead of UKCloud decommissioning the service. Note If you do not remove all the environment items listed, UKCloud will not be able to complete the termination process and you may still be charged for those remaining items. All users with access to the service being terminated must be removed from the Portal by an administrator within the customer organisation. UKCloud responsibilities After you've removed all of the items from your account that you're responsible for, UKCloud will: Remove service-specific environment items as listed in Responsibilities by service below. Securely and permanently erase any residual customer data and configurations that remain. Our data removal solution is independently validated by periodic IT Security Health Check tests. While the solution does not align with the documented requirements of HMG IA Standard No.5, it has successfully passed all CHECK/ITSHC activities, and has been assessed and validated by the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) on behalf of specific customers. Remove your account (and company, if necessary). Return any prepaid sums for services that you have not consumed (unless otherwise identified in the UKCloud Pricing Guide ). Arrange to return all confidential information. Costs There are no termination costs associated with cancelling UKCloud services. However, you should consider the following: You are responsible for extracting your own data from the service and any costs that may incur. We may make additional charges for transferring data out of the service. We reserve the right to pass through third-party price rises that are not within our direct control. If you use service options with minimum terms, such as Neustar UltraDNS from UKCloud or Neustar DDoS Protection from UKCloud, you will continue to be charged for these until the end of those terms. We reserve the right to charge for any content that you leave in your environment or for retrieving and returning your content.

    "title": "Protective Monitoring from UKCloud",
    "keywords": "Protective Monitoring from UKCloud Overview Protective monitoring is a term that comes from the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), listed in the Good Practice Guide 13 (GPG-13). It provides a set of guidance as to what controls should be implemented, and the depth of those controls, to make sure that the data being stored or transported in an IT estate is protected against cyber threats. As part of our activity to maintain the security of our platforms, we adhere to protective monitoring best practice from the NCSC. UKCloud's Protective Monitoring protects both the Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL security domains with resilient, 24x7 enhanced protective monitoring, vulnerability scanning and assessment. Protective Monitoring service scope Our protective monitoring activity covers all assets that provide our products to customers, including all hosting infrastructure, networking and management applications. In the case of our compute products (UKCloud for VMware, UKCloud for OpenStack, UKCloud for Microsoft Azure and UKCloud for Oracle Software), we protectively monitor up to the hypervisor (the component that provides the virtual machines). For components above this infrastructure (for example, your own virtual machines, appliances and applications) you are responsible for providing an appropriate protective monitoring capability. The following demonstrates the scope of UKCloud's Protective Monitoring: Perimeter routes and firewalls - UKCloud protectively monitors and regularly assesses any potential vulnerabilities at the perimeter, alongside other mitigations including DDoS * and active vulnerability scanning. Compute hypervisor, UKCloud networks and physical infrastructure - UKCloud protectively monitors and regularly assesses vulnerabilities across all components of the hosting estate (for example, hypervisors, hosting infrastructure, servers, networking and management applications). Customer VDC, vApps, VMs, Virtual Network Appliance and customer networks - This is the customer's responsibility to monitor. External connectivity, for example, internet, PSN, HSCN, Janet, RLI, leased lines - This is the responsibility of the telecommunications provider. * For more information about UKCloud's volumetric DDoS protection, see the DDoS mitigation service FAQs . We do not share a feed from our platform protective monitoring to customers, so you cannot connect your own SOC to the protective monitoring data. You can however get access to log data for all traffic traversing your virtual boundary firewall. Cyber Security News page The Cyber Security News page in the UKCloud Portal, accessed via the navigation panel under Monitoring , lets you see, at a glance, general threat briefs and security news from around the world as analysed by e2e-assure. All Portal users can access the Cyber Security News page. Each brief includes a headline in bold text that sums up the threat to help you scan through the feed quickly. Briefs are also colour-coded, ranging from yellow to red, to indicate the severity of the brief: Yellow indicating a low threat level and red indicating a high threat level. A more in-depth description of the threat is included below the headline. This provides you with more information and recommended actions, depending on the threat. The feed is listed in chronological order with two timestamps: one showing when the brief was originally published and the other showing when the brief was most recently updated. You can search and filter the feed on the Cyber Security News page to define exactly what content you want to see. Use the search bar to query specific words or phrases within the threat briefs. To access filtering options, to edit the priority and date range you want to see in your feed or search results, click Advanced Search . Security Operations Service page The Security Operations Service page in the UKCloud Portal, accessed via the navigation panel under Monitoring , shows the number of logs processed against the UKCloud platform by our Security Operations Service. All Portal users can access the Cyber Security News page. Any threat information specific to your account is raised as a My Calls ticket to ensure that it's seen in a timely manner by the relevant person. Example security incidents Communication seen with known malware sites Data being exchanged in plain text Certificate issues Brute force attacks Vulnerability scanning Attempts to compromise operating systems and services Machines contacting known malicious domains Machines being used for personal use (if you're running a VPN server, UKCloud will capture internet browsing) Any traffic that is encrypted will not be spotted by UKCloud unless it's contacting known malicious domains Feedback If you would like to request that other clouds, networks or security domains are supported, contact products@ukcloud.com .

    "href": "articles/other/other-ref-sites-regions-zones.html",
    "title": "Understanding sites, regions and zones",
    "keywords": "Understanding sites, regions and zones Introduction This guide explains how we've designed the UKCloud platform using sites, regions and zones to enable you to design a highly-available and disaster-tolerant cloud solution that meets your specific requirements for resilience. The diagram below shows the relationship between sites, regions and zones and provides a broad indication as to the purpose of each. We've engineered our cloud platform to tolerate inevitable failures at or below the infrastructure layer (for example, hardware failures and power or cooling interruptions) to ensure that the platform remains available. To ensure your applications and the services they deliver are highly available, we encourage you to design for failure and build disaster recovery capabilities into your applications. Depending on the type of failure you are trying to mitigate, our platform enables you to use sites, regions and zones to implement appropriate resilience into your solution. For specific services, such as UKCloud for OpenStack or UKCloud for VMware, we provide more detailed design guides and blueprints to explore the design choices you have with our platform. Additionally, you can always engage a Cloud Architect who can work with you to deploy the right architecture on our platform. Understanding sites What is a site? A site is a geographically specific location. UKCloud has two UK‑based sites, separated by 100 km, in Farnborough and Corsham (see diagram above). Sites provide: Independent power, security, geography and infrastructure Independent WAN connections from multiple service providers Local maintenance and platform support teams Shared UKCloud service support and management teams How do sites help me mitigate against failure? Building your solution across multiple sites provides resilience against scenarios such as natural disasters, targeted terrorist attacks or mass WAN failure. If an event affects a particular site, your system can continue running on the other site. The separation of UKCloud's two sites aligns with CESG's published guidance on architecting for disaster avoidance. What else should I consider? Although we operate secure, high‑bandwidth and low‑latency interconnects between our sites, the latency of transporting data within the same site will always be lower. If you deploy your solution across sites, you should always perform thorough testing to ensure that any increase in latency (particularly storage latency) is within tolerable levels and does not impede the performance of your solution under heavy load. Understanding regions What is a region? Within each site, our platform provides a number of independent regions (see diagram above). Each region is a physically segregated part of the platform with its own power infrastructure, management services and networking components. This enables you to design resilient solutions that are contained entirely within a single site. Each region provides a particular subset of UKCloud services, for example UKCloud for VMware, UKCloud for OpenStack or Cloud Storage, so the regions that you can use for your solution depend on where your selected (and prospective) UKCloud services are available. For example, in the diagram below you can see that UKCloud for VMware is provided in regions 2 and 5, however UKCloud for OpenStack is provided only in region 5. How do regions help me mitigate against failure? By architecting for separate regions, you can improve resilience to outages that affect: The control and management of your VMs Network connectivity to your VMs The power infrastructure within the data centre. The impact of an outage on your environment depends on the services you consume and how you have architected your environment at the region level. For example, the impact of a region‑affecting outage for UKCloud for VMware may be different than for UKCloud for OpenStack. What else should I consider? Certain product features --- such as on-platform protection technologies like snapshot protection or journaling --- may be available only in certain regions. Check UKCloud services by region for further details. In addition, some common service features --- such as VM image catalogues, access to storage pools, and so on --- may be available only to solutions running within that region, and not replicated by UKCloud across multiple regions. This may require you to duplicate some of your management tools and services. You should consider which services are available across multiple regions when designing your solutions. Understanding zones What is a zone? A zone is a distinct hardware installation within a region, utilising common networking infrastructure but having independent server and storage infrastructure. Ordinarily, each zone hosts only one UKCloud service, but each service, for example UKCloud for VMware or UKCloud for OpenStack, may be provided in multiple zones in each site (see diagram below). Each zone is part of a particular security domain: either Assured OFFICIAL or Elevated OFFICIAL (see diagram below). How do zones help me mitigate against failure? You can utilise zones to provide additional confidence in your ability to tolerate outages and mitigate against: Cluster-wide component outages caused by logical configuration errors Significant hardware failures Issues occurring within the hypervisor or virtual SAN For example, you can load-balance across two zones to ensure that your service stays online in the event of a zone outage. What else should I consider? Designing your solutions to make use of zones rather than regions and sites achieves the lowest latency, helping to reduce the risk of data inconsistency while optimising the IO performance across your solution. Depending on the services you consume, each zone may have its own management interface, so the complexity of managing your environment potentially increases with each additional zone. You should also be aware that the zones within a region operate on a shared network, therefore any issues on that network affect all the zones in the region. If you want to mitigate against potential network outages, you should consider designing your solution across multiple regions, but you should carefully assess the risk that the highly unlikely event of a loss of region or site presents and how this may influence your overall solution.

    "title": "SLA definition",
    "keywords": "SLA definition Availability UKCloud will use reasonable endeavours to ensure that the availability of the UKCloud service purchased by the customer (the service) in a given calendar month equals the applicable availability commitment . To define availability, UKCloud monitors a number of service elements — some generic, some service specific — which collectively enable the customer to use or access the service. If the availability of the service is less than the associated Availability Commitment, the customer may request Service Credits for the service within 30 calendar days of the service being deemed unavailable. Unavailability and service level agreement events Subject to the service level agreement (SLA) limitations detailed below, the service will be considered unavailable (and an SLA event will be deemed as having taken place) if UKCloud's monitoring detects that the service or component has failed for five consecutive minutes. The total number of minutes that the service is unavailable is measured from the time that UKCloud confirms the SLA event has occurred until the time that UKCloud resolves the issue and the service becomes available to the customer. If two or more SLA events occur simultaneously, the SLA event with the longest duration will be used to determine the total number of minutes for which the service was unavailable. Service Credits If the availability of the service for a particular month falls below the availability commitment specified in the applicable SLA (subject to the SLA limitations provided below), customers will be eligible to request Service Credits. Service Credits will be calculated as a percentage of the fees billed for the monthly period during which the SLA event occurred (to be applied at the end of the billing cycle, or of the subsequent cycle if a claim is made after an invoice has been paid). Note You will not be eligible to receive a Service Credit if your account has any undisputed payments outstanding beyond their due date or you are in violation of UKCloud's Terms and Conditions including the UKCloud System Interconnect Security Policy (SISP). Service level agreement limitations The following will be excluded from any time-based calculations related to the service being unavailable: Service dependent — Planned Maintenance windows (as specified in the applicable Service Definition) Emergency Maintenance (as specified in the applicable Service Definition) Your misuse of a particular service (as defined in the UKCloud Terms and Conditions and the UKCloud System Interconnect Security Policy (SISP)) A force majeure event Denial of service attacks, virus or hacking attacks for which there is no commercially reasonable known solution; or any other events that are not within the direct control of UKCloud or that could not have been avoided with commercially reasonable care Packet loss, network or connectivity (for example, internet, MPLS) problems beyond UKCloud's management boundary (for example, border router) supporting our connectivity to the public internet or government secure networks Any customer-defined or customer-controlled event (for example, unavailability of service resulting from inadequate customer-subscribed services, resources or configuration) The customer will not be eligible to receive a Service Credit if the service account has any undisputed payments outstanding beyond their due date, or you are in violation of UKCloud's Terms and Conditions including the UKCloud System Interconnect Security Policy (SISP). Service level agreement claims To request a Service Credit, the customer must file a support ticket within thirty (30) calendar days of the relevant suspected SLA event. UKCloud will review the request and issue a Service Credit if applicable. Service Credits will be issued only to the customer that UKCloud invoices for the applicable instance of the service as a separate credit note that can be applied towards a future invoice for that service only. If the customer's contract term for the service expires or is terminated prior to a Service Credit being issued, the Service Credit will become void as of the date of the expiration or termination. UKCloud service level agreement monitoring Generic service components UKCloud monitors various elements across the service to ensure that availability can be measured appropriately and realistically. Some elements are generic across all services others are service specific. UKCloud Portal UKCloud monitors the customer self-service UKCloud Portal, ( https://portal.ukcloud.com (or Elevated equivalent)).

As Oracle workloads are pinned to processor cores, VMs will only be automatically moved in the event of a host failure if the HA feature has been enabled by the customer on each VM. Customers are responsible for enabling the HA feature. If the HA feature is not enabled, UKCloud will need to move Oracle VMs to a new host so they can be restarted. The manual movement of VMs is covered by the Non-HA SLA. Customers are responsible for restarting VMs and should configure alerts to be notified if an Oracle VM failure occurs. This will not be a live migration and an application restart will be required. Customers will be advised if an action is to be performed.

    "title": "Storage options on the UKCloud platform",
    "keywords": "Storage options on the UKCloud platform Overview It's important to understand the differences between the various storage options available on the UKCloud platform to ensure you're using the most appropriate and cost-effective option for your requirements. The following diagram shows the different storage options, which are explained in more detail in the rest of this article. It's important to note that, as the UKCloud platform is a multi-tenant environment, its storage solutions are shared by all consumers within the boundary of the security domain. This means we can't provide a guaranteed minimum IOPs or throughput; however, the performance of individual datastores is actively monitored. Our Cloud Operations team regularly reviews datastore usage metrics and perform migrations of virtual machines to less populated datastores to alleviate contention if necessary. Block storage Block storage exposes raw storage devices to hosts, providing efficient, low latency access to data. This is useful for computational and transactional workloads, such as: Databases Web servers Monitoring systems The performance that you can expect from block storage will depend on many factors, such as the application's read/write ratio, and whether the IO will be random or sequential in nature. UKCloud provides two tiers of block storage – Tier 2 and Tier 1 – which use different underlying technologies to meet the requirements of different scenarios. Tier 2 block storage Tier 2 storage is our standard block storage option, suitable for workloads with typical performance requirements. We recommend using Tier 2 storage by default unless there is a specific requirement for a higher level of performance. Good candidate workloads for Tier 2 storage UKCloud recommends using Tier 2 storage by default as it offers excellent performance at a low price. Applicable use cases include: Applications that don't need consistent performance Low performance applications Applications with a high read-to-write ratio (+50% r/w) Tier 1 block storage Tier 1 storage, our most performant block storage, is available for workloads requiring consistently higher disk throughput. All media used by Tier 1 storage is quick-access, so even workloads that are accessed infrequently are serviced by faster media and workload IO is serviced a lot quicker. Consider Tier 1 storage for: Applications that require improved performance when accessing stored data, such as high activity databases Applications that have irregular usage patterns that require a consistent performance such as data warehouses or batch process applications Good candidate workloads for Tier 1 storage UKCloud recommends considering Tier 1 storage for the following use cases: Applications that need consistent performance. The nature of multi-tenant environments means that data can sometimes be pushed down storage tiers, even if it's hot. This is because other customers' application data may be hotter. Using Tier 1 storage ensures that customer data has a more predictable performance for both reads and writes. Applications with a high write-to-read ratio (+50% w/r). Some applications will have a large amount of data creation or change, which will involve a lot of write IO to the storage. Tier 1 storage reduces the latency of cache flushing to disk. High-performance applications. High performance applications are generally databases or virtual desktops, which require high read and write performance. Data warehousing. There are two data warehousing use cases: Occasionally, data may be loaded onto the UKCloud platform but not accessed for a period of time. This data would normally be de-staged to slower media, but Tier 1 provides good performance of both reads and writes, even if the data has been cold for a long time. Alternatively, data can be stored in UKCloud's Cloud Storage and loaded into Tier 1 storage when needed. This maintains high performance for active data, without the associated cost of storing infrequently accessed data. Small block, random-write databases. Data with a high volume of small random writes will benefit from the enhanced performance that Tier 1 storage provides. Tier 1 storage write performance is much better for small block writes. Large data sets. In Tier 1 storage there's a higher chance that data within a given dataset will be in quick-access media, accelerating database performance. If your application isn't currently running (on UKCloud's platform or on another environment), we'd recommend building it on the standard Tier 2 storage pool initially. You can then assess its performance once it's been set up and is running under load, and decide whether the workload should be moved to Tier 1 storage. If the workload is currently running, you can run a performance assessment on the application to understand its characteristics, enabling you to make an informed decision on where it's best placed. You can carry out this performance assessment yourself, or request support from one of our Cloud Architects. Object storage With object storage, files and their metadata are stored as objects in a flat, unstructured storage pool. Containers, or buckets, provide a method to logically group objects, which is similar to folders, but cannot be nested. Objects additionally support extended metadata enabling them to be indexed and cross-referenced in complex ways. Each object is assigned an object identifier, which enables the object to be retrieved without needing to know exactly where it is stored. UKCloud provides object storage via our Cloud Storage product, based on Dell EMC Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS). Access is via a RESTful API, which also provides support for Amazon's S3 API. For more information, see the Getting Started Guide for Cloud Storage . Use cases Some common use cases for object storage include: Medical imaging Video, audio, image storage YouTube, LinkedIn, DropBox, Wikipedia (images), eBay, Instagram VM backups Object storage is typically high-latency, low-performance and is used for archiving static content that will not change. The metadata is stored separately from the data and can be modified and re-written as needed.

NHS Digital National Applications means the applications listed at https://digital.nhs.uk/services . Any changes to this Connection Agreement shall be subject to the change control procedures as available at the HSCN Website – Providers of NHS Services section and may be updated from time-to-time by the HSCN Authority 1 Entitlement to connect to and use the HSCN 1.1 Connection to the HSCN is provided based on the business need to share information within the health and social care community. 1.2 However, to protect the availability of the HSCN as a shared resource for the health and social care system, where (in its sole discretion) the HSCN Authority has concerns in respect of the cyber security, information assurance or information governance arrangements of an organisation applying for a HSCN service it reserves the right to: 1.2.1 refuse a HSCN service if such HSCN service is not already in place; 1.2.2 restrict or modify access under a HSCN service to the HSCN Authority's systems, services or applications (including National Applications); or 1.2.3 terminate a HSCN service. 1.3 Despite the HSCN Authority's rights set out above, its preference shall be to work with a HSCN Consumer to identity and rectify root cause security issues to avoid terminating a HSCN service where possible. 1.4 However, if evidence emerges of activity or behaviour by a HSCN Consumer in relation to the use of the HSCN that would undermine the availability of the HSCN, damage the reputation of the HSCN, the NHS or Her Majesty's Government, or otherwise pose a security threat to the organisation or other HSCN Consumers or providers of the HSCN, the HSCN Authority may have no choice other than to terminate the HSCN service. 2 Security Considerations for the HSCN 2.1 The primary security consideration of the HSCN is to make sure that it is available as a resource to carry information between providers in the health and social care community. There is a secondary requirement to maintain and to improve a good standard of information governance and cyber-security across the health and social care community. This will help to reduce the exposure of the NHS and wider health and social care providers to the kinds of cyber-attack and loss of personal data that has been widely reported in the media in the last few years. 2.2 It is important that each HSCN Consumer (where necessary working with or through its IT partners, suppliers, or other HSCN Consumers): 2.2.1 works with the HSCN Authority, HSCN Suppliers, and other members of the health and social care community to help each of these requirements be realised and, in the event that a security incident – including cyber-attack or malware outbreak - is detected or suspected, works (collaboratively where necessary) to help contain the problem, minimise the impact, subsequently resolve it and then to help prevent a re-occurrence; 2.2.2 ensures that each and every other organisation which routes traffic through the HSCN Consumer's own HSCN connection: 2.2.2.1 has signed and submitted to the HSCN Authority an HSCN Connection Agreement; or 2.2.2.2 is otherwise made subject to legally binding terms identical to those set out in this Connection Agreement (which the HSCN Authority may require the HSCN Consumer to verify in writing at any time); and 2.2.3 has technical measures in place to prevent organisations that have not signed a Connection Agreement (or are not subject to terms identical to those set out in this Connection Agreement) in accordance with clause 2.2.2 are prevented from routing traffic to the HSCN through that HSCN Connection. 3 HSCN Authority's obligations under this Connection Agreement 3.1 The HSCN Authority commits to: 3.1.1 work with HSCN Consumers to help improve and maintain good cyber security and good data handling processes. This includes communicating updates to good cyber security, information governance and other related guidance to its HSCN Consumers; and 3.1.2 inform HSCN Consumers in a timely manner of any incident or security matter that the HSCN reasonably believes will have a negative impact on the connection to the HSCN. 4 HSCN Consumer Obligations 4.1 Whilst there are no specific assurance or compliance regimes to which HSCN Consumers must adhere in order to obtain a connection to the HSCN, there are a number of obligations on all organisations that use the HSCN. These are designed to help maintain the availability of the HSCN whilst improving the overall cyber security position of HSCN Consumers and continuing to protect personal information about patients and service users. Incident Reporting 4.2 In the event of a security incident which relates to Your use of the HSCN or Your connection to the HSCN, You agree that You (or a partner working on Your behalf, for example, a system supplier, or IT supplier) will: 4.2.1 conduct initial diagnosis of the incident to determine which service is the cause (or most likely cause of the incident); 4.2.2 raise the incident with Us for the affected service, who will then raise it with the CN-SP; 4.2.3 at the earliest opportunity inform the HSCN Authority through the mechanism for notifying security incidents as set out on the HSCN Website – Providers of NHS Services section and to complete actions assigned by the HSCN Authority or its representatives in an agreed timeframe to support containment and resolution of the incident; 4.2.4 if the HSCN Data Security Centre team contacts You to help resolve an incident or problem, You must respond as You would for one of Your own customers or users; 4.2.5 depending on the nature of the incident, provide audit logs holding user activities, exceptions and information security events to assist in investigations; and 4.2.6 where appropriate, notify other HSCN Consumers with whom You share a HSCN service of any incident that has been communicated to You by the HSCN Supplier or the HSCN Authority. 4.3 Where an incident occurs relating to the use of the HSCN by another HSCN Consumer or HSCN Supplier or You reasonably suspect an incident has occurred, You agree that You will notify the HSCN Authority at the earliest opportunity using the contact information set out on the HSCN website. Cyber and Information Security 4.4 All HSCN Consumers have a duty, through the implementation of robust data handling and information security practices: 4.4.1 to be 'good citizens' to help ensure that the HSCN remains available for all users; and 4.4.2 a wider duty to protect their information, systems and services from unauthorised disclosure, destruction, theft, unavailability or loss of integrity through cyber and / or other forms of attack. In some cases, this duty is set out in law, in others it is what service users and patients might reasonably expect of organisations that hold, control or process personal or personal sensitive information about them. 4.5 You acknowledge that your organisation has been notified of this information and your responsibilities to implement good information security. Network Monitoring 4.6 The HSCN Consumer agrees that the HSCN Authority Network Analytic Service will monitor the connection point between their networks and the HSCN for the purposes of maintaining the availability of the HSCN, systems and / or services that are available through the HSCN, and the connection between the HSCN and the internet. Examples include looking for abnormal amounts of traffic that could indicate a malware or other cyber security attack. 4.7 However, the HSCN Authority Network Analytic Service does not look at or store the content of network traffic. 4.8 The HSCN Consumer agrees that the HSCN Authority's Advanced Network Monitoring Service will monitor and inspect, through signature and behavioural analysis, the content of unencrypted internet-bound traffic to look for evidence of malicious or suspicious content. The HSCN Consumer acknowledges that the operation of this service involves the analysis of the content of internet traffic, including Personal Data and Sensitive Personal Data. 4.8.1 \"Controller\", \"Processor\", \"Data Subject\", \"Personal Data Breach\" and \"Processing\" shall have the same meanings as in the Data Protection Laws and \"Processed\" and \"Process\" shall be construed in accordance with the definition of \"Processing\" . \"Personal Data\" and \"Sensitive Personal Data\" shall have the same meaning as in the Data Protection Laws, and shall refer to Personal Data (or Sensitive Personal Data) provided by the HSCN Consumer to the HSCN Authority in connection with this Connection Agreement, or as otherwise Processed by the HSCN Authority in relation to the services offered to the HSCN Consumer in connection with HSCN. 4.9 For the avoidance of doubt, the HSCN Authority shall have no liability to the HSCN Consumer in respect of the functioning or non-functioning of the HSCN Authority Network Analytic Service and/or the HSCN Authority's Advanced Network Monitoring Service. Securing information 4.10 Each HSCN Consumer acknowledges that: 4.10.1 the HSCN's primary requirement is to be available as a means for sharing information between the health and social care community; 4.10.2 the HSCN does not help secure data in any way as it passes across the network. Responsibility for providing sufficient security lies with the sending and receiving organisation, or the providers and users of sites or applications that are accessed through the HSCN. This includes providing assurances that any service or application available on the HSCN or any organisations or users on the network are authentic and appropriately secured; and 4.10.3 the HSCN does not warrant the authenticity of any service, system or data available through the HSCN or of any information received through the HSCN. Access Controls 4.11 Because there is sometimes a business need to access a variety of content from a range of services, the HSCN network does not impose any restrictions on categories of sites or services that HSCN Consumers can access through the HSCN, except that: 4.11.1 for internet access, a standard set of controls are in place to prevent data from being shared with known malware resources (for example, places on the internet with which malware may try to communicate with). The purpose of this restriction is to limit the impact on the HSCN community should a malware attack take place, and as such the list of blocked sites may change from time to time; and 4.11.2 HSCN Consumers may agree access restrictions on internet access or general network access (for example, blocks on categories of internet sites) with Us, but that is a solely a matter between the HSCN Consumers and Us. HSCN Service Information 4.12 Each HSCN Consumer agrees to provide and maintain (through their connection profile information posted at the HSCN Website – Providers of NHS Services section): 4.12.1 whether their connection to the HSCN is shared with any other organisations (whether health and social care or not) and if so the identity of those organisations; and 4.12.2 the following contacts at the HSCN Consumer: 4.12.2.1 the business sponsor of the connection – this contact should be in a senior position in the organisation who is ultimately responsible for the use of the HSCN Connectivity Services (e.g. Chief Information Officer); and 4.12.2.2 security lead with whom the HSCN Authority can communicate security information. This individual may be the Senior Information Risk Officer (SIRO), Caldicott Guardian, Chief Security Officer or of equivalent standing and responsibility. For some HSCN Consumers, this may be a contact at for example, a partner organisation such as an IT systems supplier or shared service provider who handles security matters for the HSCN Consumer. Information Governance – NHS Digital National Applications 4.13 The HSCN Consumer shall comply with all applicable information governance requirements in order to handle patient data, and access systems, services and resources that are available through the HSCN. 4.14 For the NHS Digital National Applications, this is currently the Data Security & Protection Toolkit (DSPT). For other systems and services, local arrangements may apply. 4.15 By accepting the terms of the Connection Agreement, You are agreeing to comply with requirements and arrangements for those systems and services which you will access or make use of through the HSCN. 4.16 The current arrangements for the NHS Digital National Applications are set out here: https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk . HSCN Consumers should check with organisations that provide systems and services that they use as to local arrangements that are in place. 4.17 The HSCN Consumer shall comply with all relevant policies, guidelines or directions from time to time made available on the HSCN Data Security Centre websites, accessible at the following locations (and/or via any replacement sites identified by the HSCN Authority from time to time): 4.17.1 https://digital.nhs.uk/services/data-and-cyber-security-protecting-information-and-data-in-health-and-care ; and 4.17.2 http://systems.digital.nhs.uk/infogov . https://info.ukcloud.com/hscn-annexa-further-legal-terms"

HSCN Supplier means any supplier providing any element of the HSCN services. HSCN Website – Providers of NHS Services means the providers of NHS services section of the HSCN website that can be accessed at https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-socialcare-network/hscn-suppliers#central-network-services . Data Security & Protection Toolkit (DSPT) means the system for assessing compliance with Department of Health information governance policies and standards available at: https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk . NHS Digital National Applications means the applications listed at https://digital.nhs.uk/services . Any changes to this Connection Agreement shall be subject to the change control procedures as available at the HSCN Website – Providers of NHS Services section and may be updated from time-to-time by the HSCN Authority 1 Entitlement to connect to and use the HSCN 1.1 Connection to the HSCN is provided based on the business need to share information within the health and social care community. 1.2 However, to protect the availability of the HSCN as a shared resource for the health and social care system, where (in its sole discretion) the HSCN Authority has concerns in respect of the cyber security, information assurance or information governance arrangements of an organisation applying for a HSCN service it reserves the right to: 1.2.1 refuse a HSCN service if such HSCN service is not already in place; 1.2.2 restrict or modify access under a HSCN service to the HSCN Authority's systems, services or applications (including National Applications); or 1.2.3 terminate a HSCN service. 1.3 Despite the HSCN Authority's rights set out above, its preference shall be to work with a HSCN Consumer to identity and rectify root cause security issues to avoid terminating a HSCN service where possible. 1.4 However, if evidence emerges of activity or behaviour by a HSCN Consumer in relation to the use of the HSCN that would undermine the availability of the HSCN, damage the reputation of the HSCN, the NHS or Her Majesty's Government, or otherwise pose a security threat to the organisation or other HSCN Consumers or providers of the HSCN, the HSCN Authority may have no choice other than to terminate the HSCN service. 2 Security Considerations for the HSCN 2.1 The primary security consideration of the HSCN is to make sure that it is available as a resource to carry information between providers in the health and social care community. There is a secondary requirement to maintain and to improve a good standard of information governance and cyber-security across the health and social care community. This will help to reduce the exposure of the NHS and wider health and social care providers to the kinds of cyber-attack and loss of personal data that has been widely reported in the media in the last few years. 2.2 It is important that each HSCN Consumer (where necessary working with or through its IT partners, suppliers, or other HSCN Consumers): 2.2.1 works with the HSCN Authority, HSCN Suppliers, and other members of the health and social care community to help each of these requirements be realised and, in the event that a security incident – including cyber-attack or malware outbreak - is detected or suspected, works (collaboratively where necessary) to help contain the problem, minimise the impact, subsequently resolve it and then to help prevent a re-occurrence; 2.2.2 ensures that each and every other organisation which routes traffic through the HSCN Consumer's own HSCN connection: 2.2.2.1 has signed and submitted to the HSCN Authority an HSCN Connection Agreement; or 2.2.2.2 is otherwise made subject to legally binding terms identical to those set out in this Connection Agreement (which the HSCN Authority may require the HSCN Consumer to verify in writing at any time); and 2.2.3 has technical measures in place to prevent organisations that have not signed a Connection Agreement (or are not subject to terms identical to those set out in this Connection Agreement) in accordance with clause 2.2.2 are prevented from routing traffic to the HSCN through that HSCN Connection. 3 HSCN Authority's obligations under this Connection Agreement 3.1 The HSCN Authority commits to: 3.1.1 work with HSCN Consumers to help improve and maintain good cyber security and good data handling processes. This includes communicating updates to good cyber security, information governance and other related guidance to its HSCN Consumers; and 3.1.2 inform HSCN Consumers in a timely manner of any incident or security matter that the HSCN reasonably believes will have a negative impact on the connection to the HSCN. 4 HSCN Consumer Obligations 4.1 Whilst there are no specific assurance or compliance regimes to which HSCN Consumers must adhere in order to obtain a connection to the HSCN, there are a number of obligations on all organisations that use the HSCN. These are designed to help maintain the availability of the HSCN whilst improving the overall cyber security position of HSCN Consumers and continuing to protect personal information about patients and service users. Incident Reporting 4.2 In the event of a security incident which relates to Your use of the HSCN or Your connection to the HSCN, You agree that You (or a partner working on Your behalf, for example, a system supplier, or IT supplier) will: 4.2.1 conduct initial diagnosis of the incident to determine which service is the cause (or most likely cause of the incident); 4.2.2 raise the incident with Us for the affected service, who will then raise it with the CN-SP; 4.2.3 at the earliest opportunity inform the HSCN Authority through the mechanism for notifying security incidents as set out on the HSCN Website – Providers of NHS Services section and to complete actions assigned by the HSCN Authority or its representatives in an agreed timeframe to support containment and resolution of the incident; 4.2.4 if the HSCN Data Security Centre team contacts You to help resolve an incident or problem, You must respond as You would for one of Your own customers or users; 4.2.5 depending on the nature of the incident, provide audit logs holding user activities, exceptions and information security events to assist in investigations; and 4.2.6 where appropriate, notify other HSCN Consumers with whom You share a HSCN service of any incident that has been communicated to You by the HSCN Supplier or the HSCN Authority. 4.3 Where an incident occurs relating to the use of the HSCN by another HSCN Consumer or HSCN Supplier or You reasonably suspect an incident has occurred, You agree that You will notify the HSCN Authority at the earliest opportunity using the contact information set out on the HSCN website. Cyber and Information Security 4.4 All HSCN Consumers have a duty, through the implementation of robust data handling and information security practices: 4.4.1 to be 'good citizens' to help ensure that the HSCN remains available for all users; and 4.4.2 a wider duty to protect their information, systems and services from unauthorised disclosure, destruction, theft, unavailability or loss of integrity through cyber and / or other forms of attack. In some cases, this duty is set out in law, in others it is what service users and patients might reasonably expect of organisations that hold, control or process personal or personal sensitive information about them. 4.5 You acknowledge that your organisation has been notified of this information and your responsibilities to implement good information security. Network Monitoring 4.6 The HSCN Consumer agrees that the HSCN Authority Network Analytic Service will monitor the connection point between their networks and the HSCN for the purposes of maintaining the availability of the HSCN, systems and / or services that are available through the HSCN, and the connection between the HSCN and the internet. Examples include looking for abnormal amounts of traffic that could indicate a malware or other cyber security attack. 4.7 However, the HSCN Authority Network Analytic Service does not look at or store the content of network traffic. 4.8 The HSCN Consumer agrees that the HSCN Authority's Advanced Network Monitoring Service will monitor and inspect, through signature and behavioural analysis, the content of unencrypted internet-bound traffic to look for evidence of malicious or suspicious content. The HSCN Consumer acknowledges that the operation of this service involves the analysis of the content of internet traffic, including Personal Data and Sensitive Personal Data. 4.8.1 \"Controller\" , \"Processor\" , \"Data Subject\" , \"Personal Data Breach\" and \"Processing\" shall have the same meanings as in the Data Protection Laws and \"Processed\" and \"Process\" shall be construed in accordance with the definition of \"Processing\". \"Personal Data\" and \"Sensitive Personal Data\" shall have the same meaning as in the Data Protection Laws, and shall refer to Personal Data (or Sensitive Personal Data) provided by the HSCN Consumer to the HSCN Authority in connection with this Connection Agreement, or as otherwise Processed by the HSCN Authority in relation to the services offered to the HSCN Consumer in connection with HSCN. 4.9 For the avoidance of doubt, the HSCN Authority shall have no liability to the HSCN Consumer in respect of the functioning or non-functioning of the HSCN Authority Network Analytic Service and/or the HSCN Authority's Advanced Network Monitoring Service. Securing information 4.10 Each HSCN Consumer acknowledges that: 4.10.1 the HSCN's primary requirement is to be available as a means for sharing information between the health and social care community; 4.10.2 the HSCN does not help secure data in any way as it passes across the network. Responsibility for providing sufficient security lies with the sending and receiving organisation, or the providers and users of sites or applications that are accessed through the HSCN. This includes providing assurances that any service or application available on the HSCN or any organisations or users on the network are authentic and appropriately secured; and 4.10.3 the HSCN does not warrant the authenticity of any service, system or data available through the HSCN or of any information received through the HSCN. Access Controls 4.11 Because there is sometimes a business need to access a variety of content from a range of services, the HSCN network does not impose any restrictions on categories of sites or services that HSCN Consumers can access through the HSCN, except that: 4.11.1 for internet access, a standard set of controls are in place to prevent data from being shared with known malware resources (for example, places on the internet with which malware may try to communicate with). The purpose of this restriction is to limit the impact on the HSCN community should a malware attack take place, and as such the list of blocked sites may change from time to time; and 4.11.2 HSCN Consumers may agree access restrictions on internet access or general network access (for example, blocks on categories of internet sites) with Us, but that is a solely a matter between the HSCN Consumers and Us. HSCN Service Information 4.12 Each HSCN Consumer agrees to provide and maintain (through their connection profile information posted at the HSCN Website – Providers of NHS Services section): 4.12.1 whether their connection to the HSCN is shared with any other organisations (whether health and social care or not) and if so the identity of those organisations; and 4.12.2 the following contacts at the HSCN Consumer: 4.12.2.1 the business sponsor of the connection – this contact should be in a senior position in the organisation who is ultimately responsible for the use of the HSCN Connectivity Services (e.g. Chief Information Officer); and 4.12.2.2 security lead with whom the HSCN Authority can communicate security information. This individual may be the Senior Information Risk Officer (SIRO), Caldicott Guardian, Chief Security Officer or of equivalent standing and responsibility. For some HSCN Consumers, this may be a contact at for example, a partner organisation such as an IT systems supplier or shared service provider who handles security matters for the HSCN Consumer. Information Governance – NHS Digital National Applications 4.13 The HSCN Consumer shall comply with all applicable information governance requirements in order to handle patient data, and access systems, services and resources that are available through the HSCN. 4.14 For the NHS Digital National Applications, this is currently the Data Security & Protection Toolkit (DSPT). For other systems and services, local arrangements may apply. 4.15 By accepting the terms of the Connection Agreement, You are agreeing to comply with requirements and arrangements for those systems and services which you will access or make use of through the HSCN. 4.16 The current arrangements for the NHS Digital National Applications are set out here: https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk . HSCN Consumers should check with organisations that provide systems and services that they use as to local arrangements that are in place. 4.17 The HSCN Consumer shall comply with all relevant policies, guidelines or directions from time to time made available on the HSCN Data Security Centre websites, accessible at the following locations (and/or via any replacement sites identified by the HSCN Authority from time to time): 4.17.1 https://digital.nhs.uk/services/data-and-cyber-security-protecting-information-and-data-in-health-and-care ; and 4.17.2 http://systems.digital.nhs.uk/infogov . https://info.ukcloud.com/hscn-annexa-further-legal-terms"

    "keywords": "Monitoring the UKCloud platform Overview This article helps you understand what UKCloud monitors, and how we manage alerts created by the monitoring system. Areas of monitoring responsibility The diagram below shows a typical application stack and identifies the areas that can be monitored. The services below the red line on the diagram are monitored by us for both availability and performance (at a platform level). Incoming data is scanned and assessed, and any results outside of a defined threshold generates an alert inside our monitoring platform. Additional monitoring above the red line is the responsibility of the customer organisation. How does UKCloud monitor platform availability? We use a mixture of availability checks and synthetic transactions to monitor the availability of our platform. The platform level monitoring is provided at an aggregate level and does not check the availability of individual customer solutions. Technologies used We use single pane views of multiple technologies to monitor our platform. These include best of breed monitoring applications to: Monitor our cloud estate, including all core services and underlying hosts (in summary, all non-network devices). Monitor the underlying internal UKCloud infrastructure and core network devices. Monitor for potential Security Incidents 24 hours a day (Protective Monitoring, or ProMon), enabling us to benefit from industry leading detection and protection against security related incidents. This service is fully GPG13 (Good Practice Guide 13) compliant and is UK Government recommended. Details of systems and services monitored We monitor each individual component of the platform and then roll this data up into a single concise dashboard. This provides us with both RED and GREEN alerting systems at the component level and enables us to understand the overall health of a system. The list below provides a quick overview of how some of the key components of the UKCloud platform are monitored, which takes place across all services and both security domains (Assured and Elevated). UKCloud Portal UKCloud Portal (including transaction and performance tests) Synthetic login tests through the GUI and the Portal API. In depth monitoring of the web application layer, including page render and database access times. Multi-cloud services Cloud estate (including all core services and underlying hosts) Host CPU/memory stats Host connectivity status Host bandwidth throughput Host storage connectivity and throughput Core service status Underlying storage (including storage pools and storage performance) LUN capacity LUN status Data store connectivity Data store throughput Cloud management platform (including transaction and performance tests) Creation/deletion/modification of instances or groups of instances Multi-cloud enabling services Cloud Storage Infrastructure (including transaction and performance tests) What UKCloud monitors in your environment We do not monitor any individual component inside your environment. The table below outlines what we monitor inside and outside your environment, and what you can and should monitor: External connectivity (internet, PSN, HSCN, etc.) Network gateway Instance Storage Customer monitors Application performance Gateway state Gateway rules and activity VPN Instance management Instance performance Instance state Storage profiles UKCloud monitors Connection availability Bandwidth throughput Customer gateway availability and responsiveness Network availability Platform bandwidth Host availability Platform availability Platform performance Management plane availability Some management plane performance Platform availability Platform responsiveness and performance What can UKCloud provide, and what can you gain yourself?

Intended audience This Getting Started Guide is intended for any user with access to the Portal. Note The options you can see and tasks you can perform within the Portal depend on the services available in your account and the permissions you've been granted by your Portal administrator. Before you begin You should have received your Portal login credentials from your Portal administrator. If you're the Portal administrator, a member of the Service Delivery team will provide your login credentials. The Portal works with Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox. Logging in to the UKCloud Portal The first thing you need to do is log in. Go to the appropriate URL, depending on the security domain in which your service is located: Assured OFFICIAL: https://portal.ukcloud.com Elevated OFFICIAL: Contact your Portal administrator, your Service Delivery Manager (or servicedelivery@ukcloud.com ), or UKCloud Support (call 01252 303 300 and select option 2) On the log in page, enter your credentials and click Log in . Tip If you've forgotten your password, click the Forgotten password? link to request a password reset. If this is the first time you've logged in, use the temporary password you were given by your Portal administrator or the Service Delivery team. You'll be prompted to change this temporary password. Note If you incorrectly enter your password three times, you'll be prompted to enter a captcha code until you successfully log in. If you incorrectly enter the captcha code or your password another three times, a seventh unsuccessful login attempt will result in your account being locked. You'll need to contact your Portal administrator to unlock your account. If your Portal administrator has enabled two-factor authentication (2FA), you'll be prompted to enter a six digit code. Use your 2FA app to generate the code and enter it here. (If this is the first time you've logged in, you'll be prompted to set up 2FA; see How to set up two-factor authentication for a user account ). Getting to know the UKCloud Portal After you log in, you'll see the Portal Home page. A Portal page is made up of three main areas: Toolbar Navigation panel Content area Toolbar Each user account is associated with one or more customer accounts. Within the Portal, you can work within any customer account to which you have access. From the toolbar, you can switch between different customer accounts. Note When you switch between accounts, you may be prompted to enter a 2FA code again if this additional security measure has been enabled by the Portal administrator of that account. In the toolbar, you can also click your username to access the following options: Notifications - List all Portal notifications. Unread notifications are displayed in bold.

    "title": "How to use the UKCloud Portal API",
    "keywords": "How to use the UKCloud Portal API Overview The UKCloud Portal API enables you to interact programmatically with your UKCloud environment. For example, you can use API calls to view information about the components of your environment. This guide shows you how to use the API by providing a worked example that steps through the process of creating a new virtual data centre (VDC). For more information about any of the API endpoints used in this guide, see the UKCloud Portal API User Guide . About the examples in this guide The examples in this guide use endpoints that are available only in regions 5, 6, 13 and 14 of the UKCloud platform. If your environment is in a different region, you won't be able to use these endpoints yourself, however you should still find the guide useful as a reference for how to use the Portal API. For more information about UKCloud regions, see Understanding sites, regions and zones . The examples in this guide are shown as curl commands, but you may find it easier to work with the API by installing a REST client (for example, Insomnia). Authenticating to the API The Portal API uses session authentication. Before calling any of the API endpoints, you must first authenticate to the API. Send a POST request to the authenticate endpoint. Pass the following parameters in the request body: email - the email address you use to log in to the UKCloud Portal password - the password you use to log in to the UKCloud Portal For example: read portal_email # Enter your Portal email address read -s portal_password # Enter your Portal password authentication_body=\"$( jq --arg email \"$portal_email\" --arg password \"$portal_password\" --null-input '{email: $email, password: $password}' )\" curl -c cookies.txt 'https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/authenticate' -X POST -d \"$authentication_body\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' Note Install jq if you don't already have it: Mac: brew install jq Linux: sudo apt-get install jq If the authentication is successful, the endpoint returns a cookie that provides authentication for the next 900 seconds (15 minutes) and a response that tells you how long the session will last: {\"expire_after\":900} If the authentication is unsuccessful, the endpoint returns a 401 status code (Authentication Error). Using the Portal API to create a VDC The steps for creating a VDC are: Request a list of accounts Request a list of vOrgs Create a VDC Requesting a list of accounts To create a VDC, you need to know the ID of the account in which you want to create it. If you need to find your account ID, send a GET request to the accounts endpoint to return a list of all your accounts. For example: curl -b cookies.txt 'https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/accounts' | jq If you need to authenticate to the Portal API first, see Authenticating to the API . The response lists the accounts associated with the email address you authenticated against. Find the account you want to work in and make a note of the account ID. In our example, we want to create a VDC in the account called My Account . The list of accounts returned by the API includes My Account and we can see that the ID of that account is 676 . [ ..., // other accounts filtered out { \"name\": \"My Account\", \"id\": 676 } ] Requesting a list of vOrgs Each account can have multiple vOrgs associated with it, so you also need to know the ID of the vOrg in which you want to create your new VDC. If you don't know the vOrg ID, send a GET request to the vorgs endpoint. If you need to authenticate to the Portal API first, see Authenticating to the API . Pass the following parameter in the request URL: account_id - the ID of the account in which you want to create your VDC For example: curl -b cookies.txt 'https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/accounts/676/vorgs/' | jq This returns a list of vOrgs associated with the specified account. A vOrg ID is made up of two numbers separated by a hyphen: the ID of the account to which the vOrg belongs and a number to identify the vOrg within the account. In our example, we want to create our VDC in the vOrg, My Org . We can see from the response to our API call that the vOrg ID we need is 676-2 . { \"data\": [ { \"id\": \"676-2\", \"type\": \"vOrg\", \"attributes\": { \"name\": \"My Org\" } } ] } Creating a VDC When you have the account and vOrg IDs, you can go ahead and create your VDC. Send a POST request to the vdcs endpoint. If you need to authenticate to the Portal API first, see Authenticating to the API . Pass the following parameters in the request URL: account_id - the ID of the account in which you want to create your VDC vorg_id - the unique number that identifies the vOrg in the account in which you want to create your VDC Pass the following parameters in the request body: type - you're creating a VDC, so the type is VDC vmType - the workload type of the VMs in the VDC: ESSENTIAL - VMs can have contended resource allocation; automated rebalancing is enabled to ensure the workload receives the requested performance POWER - VMs have uncontended compute resource allocation; automated rebalancing is enabled to pre-emptively optimise performance and availability PRIORITY - VMs have uncontended compute resource allocation; automated rebalancing is configured to reduce workload movement around the platform name - a name for the VDC; the name can be up to 32 characters long and can include any character except + For example: curl -b cookies.txt 'https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/accounts/676/vorgs/2/vdcs' -i -X POST -d '{ \"data\": { \"type\": \"VDC\", \"attributes\": { \"vmType\": \"POWER\", \"name\": \"My VDC\" } } }' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' Note Use the -i option in the request to view response headers so that you can see the Location header in the response. A successful response to this call includes information about the status of the build and a Location header that provides an address you can use to monitor the build process. The following example shows that the current state of the build is approved , meaning that the request to build the VDC was successful but the VDC creation process has not yet started. HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted ... Content-Type: application/json Location: /api/vdc-builds/9 ... { \"data\": { \"type\": \"VDC-build\", \"id\": \"9\", \"attributes\": { \"createdAt\": \"2016-07-28T14:16:11+01:00\", \"createdBy\": \"user@example.com\", \"state\": \"approved\" } } } Send a GET request to the vdc-builds endpoint to monitor the progress of the build. Pass the following parameter in the request URL: build_id - the ID of the build process In our example, the build ID is 9 , so we can send the following request: curl -b cookies.txt 'https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/vdc-builds/9' | jq If the build has started and is still in progress, the state changes to running . For example: { \"data\": { \"type\": \"VDC-build\", \"id\": \"9\", \"attributes\": { \"createdAt\": \"2016-07-28T14:16:11+01:00\", \"createdBy\": \"user@example.com\", \"state\": \"running\" } } } If the build has been completed and the VDC has been successfully created, the state changes to completed . For example: { \"data\": { \"type\": \"VDC-build\", \"id\": \"9\", \"attributes\": { \"createdAt\": \"2016-07-28T14:16:11+01:00\", \"createdBy\": \"user@example.com\", \"state\": \"completed\" } } } You have now created your VDC. Using the Portal API to create an edge gateway After creating your VDC, you need to create an edge gateway so that your users can access it. The steps for creating an edge gateway are: Find the VDC URN Create an edge gateway Finding the VDC URN The first thing you need to do is find the URN of the VDC for which you want to create the edge gateway. If you don't know the URN, send a GET request to the vdcs endpoint. If you need to authenticate to the Portal API first, see Authenticating to the API . Pass the following parameters in the request URL: account_id - the ID of the account to which the VDC belongs To find an account ID, see Requesting a list of accounts . vorg_id - the ID of the vOrg to which the VDC belongs To find a vOrg ID, see Requesting a list of vOrgs . For example: curl -b cookies.txt 'https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/accounts/676/vorgs/2/vdcs' | jq This returns a list of VDCs associated with the specified vOrg. In our example, we want to create an edge gateway for the VDC we just created ( My VDC ). We can see from the response to our API call that the URN we need is urn:vcloud:vdc:1a7570ea-29d9-4090-9714-75c262a123ad . { \"data\": [ { \"id\": \"urn:vcloud:vdc:1a7570ea-29d9-4090-9714-75c262a123ad\", \"type\": \"VDC\", \"attributes\": { \"name\": \"My VDC\" } }, { \"id\": \"urn:vcloud:vdc:f204dc27-c832-4aa5-9abd-19ca83fcfff1\", \"type\": \"VDC\", \"attributes\": { \"name\": \"Another VDC\" } } ] } Make a note of the VDC's full URN. You'll use this in the next step. Creating an edge gateway Now that you have your VDC URN, you can use the Portal API to create your edge gateway. Send a POST request to the edge-gateways endpoint. If you need to authenticate to the Portal API first, see Authenticating to the API . Pass the following parameters in the request URL: account_id - the ID of the account in which you want to create your edge gateway vorg_id - the unique number that identifies the vOrg in the account in which you want to create your edge gateway vdc_urn - the URN of the VDC for which you want to create the edge gateway Pass the following parameter in the request body: type - you're creating an edge gateway, so the type is EdgeGateway connectivityType - the type of connectivity the edge gateway provides into the VDC: Internet - in the Assured security domain External - in the Elevated security domain For example: curl -b cookies.txt -i 'https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/accounts/676/vorgs/2/vdcs/urn:vcloud:vdc:1a7570ea-29d9-4090-9714-75c262a123ad/edge-gateways' -X POST -d '{ \"data\": { \"type\": \"EdgeGateway\", \"attributes\": { \"connectivityType\": \"Internet\" } } }' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' As when you created your VDC, the response to this call includes a Location header with the build ID so that you can monitor the progress of the build. For example: HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted ... Content-Type: application/json Location: /api/edge-gateway-builds/10 { \"data\": { \"type\": \"EdgeGateway-build\", \"id\": \"10\", \"attributes\": { \"createdAt\": \"2016-07-28T16:41:47+01:00\", \"createdBy\": \"user@example.com\", \"state\": \"approved\" } } } After leaving some time for the edge gateway to be created, send a GET request to the edge-gateway-builds endpoint to check the progress of the build. Pass the following parameter in the request URL: build_id - the ID of the build process For example: curl -b cookies.txt 'https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/edge-gateway-builds/10' | jq when the edge gateway has been successfully created, the state changes to completed. For example: { \"data\": { \"type\": \"EdgeGateway-build\", \"id\": \"10\", \"attributes\": { \"createdAt\": \"2016-07-28T16:41:47+01:00\", \"createdBy\": \"user@example.com\", \"state\": \"completed\" } } } You have now created your edge gateway.

    "keywords": "Partitioning projects or end customers using UKCloud accounts Overview When you request your first service on UKCloud, you're given a single account. An account can represent an organisation, a customer contract or a specific project and contains one or more UKCloud services, such as UKCloud for VMware, Cloud Storage or UKCloud for OpenStack. Within an account, Portal administrators can set permissions for users so that they can access only those services and features that they are allowed to view and use. This is a simple way to manage smaller accounts, however the more projects or end customers you have, the more complicated and confusing the account can become without some degree of separation. Multiple accounts are very useful when managing separate customer workloads, for example billing and organisation. They can help when different teams are working on separate projects within the same business by separating the projects into different accounts enabling easier identification and management of projects and personnel. This gives the correct level of access to each team to ensure their view of the environments is specific to their work. If you decide that you would like to bring additional workloads to UKCloud, you should consider whether to stay with a single account or choose to have multiple accounts. UKCloud account options There are two options that you can choose from to manage your projects and end customers. The table below discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each option: Option 1: Multiple accounts Option 2: Single account Use cases Managed service provider with different end customers Organisation with more than one project Single customer, or partner with single customer Organisation with more than one project Advantages Enables administrators to set permissions for each account user so that they can access only the services that they are authorised to view and use. Enables easy identification of which services and users are associated with each account. Provides easy access to all your projects in one place. Facilitates greater visibility of users within each account and better security with multiple end customers by reducing the risk of human error, ensuring that each user has the correct permissions associated with their UKCloud services within the accounts. Enables easy tracking of billing for all your services in one place without the need to switch between accounts. Provides the ability to tighten and loosen security requirements based on the specifics of that workload. Reduces the risk of human error, for example, raising a ticket in the wrong account. Provides the ability to increase or decrease security requirements on an account by account basis. For example, with our Two Factor Authentication, Portal administrators can set the optional extra security for some or all accounts. Makes it easier to view individual account tickets without the need of a filter. Disadvantages Necessitates switching view in the Portal to see the services and tickets within each account. Shows all tickets in a single list, making it more difficult to locate tickets for a particular project. Similarly with users for different workloads. Introduces risk of human error, for example, raising a ticket in the wrong account. Limits granularity of authentication; cannot set individual authentication methods for different workloads. Creating multiple accounts When you bring a new workload to UKCloud, your Service Delivery Manager (SDM) will discuss your requirements and whether you want to create an additional account. If you decide that an additional account is best for your setup, UKCloud will create it for you. Once the additional account is created, the Portal administrator for the account can then add existing UKCloud Portal users to the account by raising a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal or add new users to the UKCloud Portal onto the new account, which the administrator can add themselves.

    "title": "Portal permissions",
    "keywords": "Portal permissions Overview System administrators are presented with several options to control user permissions through the UKCloud Portal. The information below is intended as a brief guide to which permissions are applied using each setting. Some user permissions are controlled on other pages. See the following articles: How to manage My Calls users How to manage OpenShift access in the UKCloud Portal How to manage UKCloud for OpenStack accounts in the UKCloud Portal User is admin? User gets full administrative privileges across the entire account. This includes all of the permissions listed below. Permissions for Settings Update: A user can update all of the account settings. This includes changing the security methods applied to the account, such as updating security restrictions to require password timeout and 2FA. These users can also change the details of the account's primary and secondary contacts. All: Presently this offers the same capability the update permission. Leave these boxes unchecked to deny a user these capabilities. Permissions for Contacts Contact and user permissions dictate whether the user is able to make changes to who has access to the account, and their role inside of it. A contact is just contact details, they may not necessarily have an actual user account. To enable a contact to have user access, they must be marked as \"active\". Create Read Update Delete All Contact Can create a new contact for that account. Can view existing contacts in that account. Can edit existing contacts but cannot create new ones. Can delete existing contacts. All of the above. User Can create a user associated to a contact for that account and assign permissions. Can view existing users for contacts. Can edit existing users and their permissions. Can delete existing users from contacts. All of the above. Permissions for UKCloud for VMware UKCloud for VMware service permissions are based on the VMware Cloud Director RBAC (role based access control) permissions. These roles are applied on a service by service basis - for example someone might be a Catalogue Author of one service, and a Console Only user in a second service. The roles exposed are: Admin Catalogue Author vApp Author vApp User Console Only You can find further details of these roles in the VMware Cloud Director Service Provider Admin Portal Guide . In addition, UKCloud have created an API Only role that restricts users with VMware Cloud Director permissions to accessing VMware Cloud Director solely via the API, with no GUI access. Note The API Only role must be selected in addition to one of the VMware Cloud Director roles (Admin, Catalogue Author, vApp Author, vApp User or Console Only); you should not select the API Only role on its own. Permissions for Cloud Storage Users need to be granted access to the relevant namespace. Once access is granted, the user will be able to see the namespace, list the buckets in the namespace and reset the secret key. The user will also be able to see consumption data for namespaces and buckets. Permissions for Billing Users with API permissions can retrieve billing information using the Portal API. For more information, see the GET /api/billing/billing-csv section of the UKCloud Portal API Reference Guide .

Tip A green tick next to a section indicates that particular security setting has been enabled. Password expiration - Set passwords to expire after a specified number of days. This ensures that users change their passwords frequently. Google two-factor authentication (2FA) - Add an extra level of authentication whereby users provide a security code from an authenticator app (such as Google Authenticator or Authy) as well as their password to confirm their identity. Portal access restriction by IP address - Restrict access so that users can only log in to the Portal from specific IP addresses. VMware Cloud Director access restriction by IP address - Restrict access so that users can only access VMware Cloud Director from specific IP addresses. To change Portal security settings: Log in to the UKCloud Portal as an administrator. If necessary, switch to the account for which you want to change the security settings.

    "title": "Portal user access",
    "keywords": "Portal user access For all customers in the UKCloud Portal there is a concept of companies, business accounts and services, which allows for different levels of segregation. When a customer starts using the UKCloud Portal, we create the initial administrator username that enables access prior to any customer data or systems being provisioned on our platforms. Security of our services is paramount and we provide the facilities to enable customers to manage user access; this is also because we have no means of verifying the identity, roles and access rights of an individual user. Administrator responsibilities Customers need to allocate administrators who are responsible for: Adding and deleting new user accounts Maintaining the appropriate permissions and access for users Activating and locking individual user accounts where required Resetting passwords Ensuring that only appropriate users are listed as administrators To avoid a situation where all administrators are unable to access services, UKCloud recommends that each customer assigns multiple administrators. UKCloud Support There are a number of Access Management activities which UKCloud can assist with. These are: Enabling access to multiple business accounts for individual users. This can be provided through a Service Request raised by a user from the business account for which access will be enabled. VPN set up on a secondary edge gateway. Customers are able to configure and manage an edge gateway VPN on their primary edge gateway; however where a secondary edge gateway is used, UKCloud will assist in establishing the VPN and administering VPN accounts and passwords. Customers can also choose to install and self-manage an alternative VPN product. Password reset and account unlock for an administrator. In this scenario the administrator will need to provide details from their memorable word. UKCloud Support will send credentials to the telephone number registered to the administrator's user account. Provide a listing of user account permissions. We recognise that customers may want to undertake an audit of the permissions of Portal users. Permissions for each user are visible under Contacts and we can also provide an extract of these. Password reset In the event that you need to reset your password: For the Assured OFFICIAL Portal, a self-service facility is available from the log on page. Alternatively your administrator can change your password. For the Elevated OFFICIAL Portal, your password or memorable word will need to be changed by your administrator. UKCloud Support will advise you of the names of your administrators if required.

    "title": "Private Cloud FAQs",
    "keywords": "Private Cloud FAQs Service What is the service? Private Cloud is a single-tenant service, powered by VMware or OpenStack, where your compute or storage requirements are hosted either in one of our data centres (to gain the benefits of our Assured and Elevated cloud platforms) or in your Crown Hosting Data Centre (CHDC). How does Private Cloud differ from UKCloud for VMware? Private Cloud provides you with dedicated infrastructure - the compute infrastructure is designed for the exclusive use of each customer, and provides the highest levels of separation and isolation from other customers. This service differs from UKCloud for VMware in that it also allows you to have more flexibility in the size of your VMs. What backup/disaster recovery options do I get? You can choose between two protection levels: Automated VM backup - providing protection in one data centre Site replication and failover - providing remote protection in a second data centre Where will my data be physically stored? Your data will be stored in our highly resilient, UK-sovereign tier 3 data centres, which are separated by over 100km. How much data can I store? A core benefit of Private Cloud is that it can scale to meet the most demanding compute requirements. Management How do I access my environment? You can access your VMs using: The remote console through the UKCloud Portal Remote access protocols (such as RDP/SSH) over a VPN or secure network Documentation on ways to interact with the platform is available from the UKCloud Knowledge Centre. Support How do I raise a support ticket? UKCloud's secure online Portal provides the most common service management functionality. Alternatively, you can contact support by phone or email. How do I manage my services? Private Cloud on the Assured OFFICIAL domain can be managed over the internet via the UKCloud Portal. For the Elevated OFFICIAL domain, the security requirements are much stricter and require either a PSN-approved connection, UKCloud Secure Remote Access, or CAPS-approved encryption. What are your service maintenance windows? See Understanding UKCloud service maintenance windows . Onboarding How can I get started with the service? On acceptance of your order, we'll work with you to create a detailed design for your Private Cloud service. The design will formalise the dedicated components required for your solution. If this is a new service for you, we will create your primary administrator account and send you a welcome pack, which includes the URL for the UKCloud Portal for access to the Knowledge Centre and service management function. Billing and legal What is the smallest unit of time I will be billed for? Billing depends on the packaging option chosen - the smallest option for this service is monthly. Please note, this service is offered under a 24-month minimum term commitment. How can I pay for the services? Service charges are billed monthly in arrears. In addition, there will be initial upfront charges, which vary depending on the pricing model selected. Payment can be made by direct bank transfer (BACS/CHAPS). How can I view billing information? Billing information is available via the UKCloud Portal. What are the termination fees? An early exit charge will be payable if the contract is terminated before the end of its original term. Customers are responsible for extracting their data from the platform if required. UKCloud may make an additional charge for transferring data out of the service. Is there a free trial? Owing to the dedicated, single-tenant nature of this service, no trials are available. Security What data is suitable for our cloud? The service is hosted in the UK and operated by SC-cleared staff. It has extensive independent validation (including CESG design reviews) that it is fully aligned with NCSC Cloud Security Principles, and is therefore ideal for all data classified at OFFICIAL (including OFFICIAL SENSITIVE). Can systems on different UKCloud platforms communicate with one another? UKCloud's Cross Domain Security Zone allows customers to use the customer-designed and managed Walled Garden to enable communication between platforms.

    "title": "Jumpstart FAQs",
    "keywords": "Jumpstart FAQs General What is Jumpstart? Jumpstart is a service providing skilled engineers and architects, on an hourly or daily basis, who can help design and build UKCloud solutions for you. How is Jumpstart different from UKCloud's standard support services? UKCloud's standard support services are limited to ensuring the availability and performance of services such as UKCloud for VMware or UKCloud for OpenStack. For example, UKCloud engineers will not usually log in to a customer environment or configure services at the operating system level. In addition, UKCloud's pre-sales resources, such as Cloud Architects, provide high-level design services only. Jumpstart provides you with dedicated resources to undertake low-level design work and is a hands-on implementation activity. What kind of things can Jumpstart help me with? Jumpstart is a flexible service that you can use for a wide range of projects. Some examples of recent projects where Jumpstart has helped include: Configuring IPsec connectivity to UKCloud Building a highly available SQL cluster Creating an Active Directory domain Building Terraform and Ansible templates for OpenStack Setting up global load balancing services Preparing applications for deployment to OpenShift Who will deliver the Jumpstart service? UKCloud has a team of consultants, with skill sets aligned to the services offered, which forms the Jumpstart service. Consultant DevOps Engineers, experts in: Cloud-native technologies OpenStack, OpenShift, Azure technologies and Cloud Storage Infrastructure as code Configuration management Continuous integration Containerisation Linux Consultant Cloud Engineers, experts in: VMware, Oracle, Azure technologies and Cloud Storage Database technologies Domain services Connectivity Linux and Windows operating systems Subject matter experts in: UKCloud products and third-party associates Disaster recovery technology, namely Zerto Cyber security Architecture design What will UKCloud be responsible for? Jumpstart is designed to provide additional skills and resources during the build phase of a project. Note that Jumpstart does not provide an ongoing support service. You should either have, or plan to have, the relevant skills to support the service following the conclusion of the Jumpstart activity. How can I order Jumpstart? Existing customers can raise a ticket in the UKCloud Portal requesting access to Jumpstart services. If you're not already a UKCloud customer, you can contact us via our website or by calling 01252 303 300. What do I need to do before my project can start? It's important that any prerequisites, such as cloud environment deployment, connectivity and assurance activities, are completed prior to a Jumpstart engineer commencing work. Your Jumpstart engineer will discuss these prerequisites during the initial kick-off call or meeting. We'll create a pre-flight checklist to track progress against these activities. How do I know what my Jumpstart engineer is working on? Prior to commencing a Jumpstart engagement, the engineer will estimate the tasks involved and the time it may take to complete them. Once the engagement commences, the engineer will record actual time used against these estimates. Your Jumpstart consultant will happily share this information with you at any time during the engagement to keep you informed. How much does the Jumpstart service cost? Both the consultancy and engineering time for the Jumpstart service is sold in packs of four days at a price of £3,500. This equates to 32 hours of Jumpstart time. When will I be billed? You'll be billed at the end of the month for Jumpstart hours consumed during that month. What happens if I don't use up all of the time I purchased? It's common to have some time remaining at the end of a Jumpstart engagement. You can use this time on demand for up to one year following the initial Jumpstart order. Common uses for this time include help, advice and modifications. Note though that there is no SLA associated with Jumpstart and it's not designed to be used as a support service. How can I re-engage a Jumpstart consultant after a period of inactivity? During the initial period of a Jumpstart engagement the project is considered to be active. During an active Jumpstart, your project will be scheduled as part of an engineer's workload and they'll be available to spend time on your project at short notice. Once a Jumpstart project enters an inactive state you'll then need to raise a ticket in the Portal to re-engage an engineer. Quick activities (typically one hour or less) will usually be dealt with quickly while longer activities will need scheduling into an engineer's workload.

    "keywords": "How to access CentOS update servers Overview Each of the two security domains within the UKCloud platform presents its own challenges regarding patching and updating CentOS machines. This article explains how to access the CentOS repository servers to receive updates. Before you attempt to establish a connection to the CentOS repo servers, you need to make sure your virtual machines (VMs) can communicate with the CentOS server, which exists outside of your cloud organisation. This may involve editing your NAT and firewall settings within your edge gateway to allow traffic to traverse into your virtual data centre (VDC). For how to do this, see the How to create NAT rules and How to create firewall rules . Assured OFFICIAL platform UKCloud's Assured OFFICIAL security domain is internet facing, so you have the option to configure your VM to connect to the internet and use a standard update tool (such as Spacewalk RHN) or the pubicly accessible CentOS mirrors, or you can use UKCloud-managed repositories. Elevated OFFICIAL platform Our Elevated OFFICIAL security domain doesn't natively connect to the internet, and the PSN network doesn't have any CentOS repo servers. To receive CentOS updates, you can use UKCloud-managed repository servers or a Walled Garden. Both options are described below. Option 1. UKCloud-managed repository servers We provide both CentOS standard repositories and EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) for CentOS 7 and 8 on our Elevated OFFICIAL security domain. Important CentOS6.x and EPEL-6 are deprecated and packages are no longer provided by UKCloud. You can view details of the CentOS Public Mirror Site here . For both Assured and Elevated OFFICIAL security domains, you can configure your systems to reference the following server: https://rh-cds.ukcloud.com . In Assured, this domain is configured in DNS, so you'll automatically be able to resolve it. For Elevated, you'll need to contact UKCloud Support to get the correct IP address and add an entry to /etc/hosts on your systems, or add an entry to your own internal DNS, to be able to resolve it. To access CentOS base files, you have 2 options. Create your own configuration file Create a file called centos-<x>.repo in /etc/yum.repos.d , where <x> is either 7 or 8 depending on your version of CentOS, and populate it with the following: CentOS 7: [centos-7-base] name=centos-7-base baseurl=https://rh-cds.ukcloud.com/centos/packages/centos-7-base/ gpgcheck=1 enabled=1 gpgkey=https://rh-cds.ukcloud.com/centos/keys/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-7 sslverify=1 [centos-7-updates] name=centos-7-updates baseurl=https://rh-cds.ukcloud.com/centos/packages/centos-7-updates/ gpgcheck=1 enabled=1 gpgkey=https://rh-cds.ukcloud.com/centos/keys/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-7 sslverify=1 [centos-7-extras] name=centos-7-extras baseurl=https://rh-cds.ukcloud.com/centos/packages/centos-7-extras/ gpgcheck=1 enabled=1 gpgkey=https://rh-cds.ukcloud.com/centos/keys/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-7 sslverify=1 CentOS 8: [centos-8-base] name=centos-8-base baseurl=https://rh-cds.ukcloud.com/centos/packages/centos-8-base/ gpgcheck=1 enabled=1 gpgkey=https://rh-cds.ukcloud.com/centos/keys/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-Official sslverify=1 [centos-8-updates] name=centos-8-updates baseurl=https://rh-cds.ukcloud.com/centos/packages/centos-8-updates/ gpgcheck=1 enabled=1 gpgkey=https://rh-cds.ukcloud.com/centos/keys/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-Official sslverify=1 [centos-8-extras] name=centos-8-extras baseurl=https://rh-cds.ukcloud.com/centos/packages/centos-8-extras/ gpgcheck=1 enabled=1 gpgkey=https://rh-cds.ukcloud.com/centos/keys/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-Official sslverify=1 To access CentOS EPEL files, create a file called epel_<x>.repo in /etc/yum.repos.d , where <x> is either 7 or 8 depending on your version of CentOS, and populate it with the following: CentOS 7: [epel-7] name=Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux 7 - $basearch baseurl=https://rh-cds.ukcloud.com/centos/packages/epel-7/ enabled=1 gpgcheck=1 gpgkey=https://rh-cds.ukcloud.com/centos/keys/RPM-GPG-KEY-EPEL-7 sslverify=1 CentOS 8: [epel-8] name=Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux 8 - $basearch baseurl=https://rh-cds.ukcloud.com/centos/packages/epel-8/ enabled=1 gpgcheck=1 gpgkey=https://rh-cds.ukcloud.com/centos/keys/RPM-GPG-KEY-EPEL-8 sslverify=1 Download the configuration file Download the repo configuration file directly from the repo server, using the following command (where <x> is either 7 or 8 depending on your version of CentOS): CentOS base updates and extras: wget -P /etc/yum.repos.d/ https://rh-cds.ukcloud.com/centos/repofiles/centos-x.repo CentOS EPEL: wget -P /etc/yum.repos.d/ https://rh-cds.ukcloud.com/centos/repofiles/epel-x.repo Remove all other *.repo files in /etc/yum.repos.d/ then execute yum clean all; rm -rf /var/cache/yum; yum repolist . Option 2. Walled Garden Choose this option only if you want full control of CentOS updates and are already thinking of deploying a Walled Garden. This option involves pulling updates into the Assured security domain, then using UKCloud's Walled Garden to move them to the Elevated security domain. It's a much more complex solution than using UKCloud-managed repository servers, and you have sole responsibility for deploying and managing it. For more information about the Walled Garden, see the Getting Started Guide for Cross Domain Security Zone .

    "keywords": "How to access Red Hat update servers (RHUI 3) Overview UKCloud has implemented a Red Hat Update Infrastructure (RHUI) to provide automatic updates to our Red Hat customers in the Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL security domains. The benefits over the existing system are the reliable availability of patch updates and Red Hat approved OS templates. Before you attempt to establish a connection to RHUI Content Delivery Systems (CDS), you need to make sure your virtual machines (VMs) can communicate with the RHUI, which exists outside of your cloud organisation. This may involve editing the NAT and firewall settings within your edge gateway to allow traffic to traverse into your virtual data centre (VDC). For how to do this, see the articles for creating NAT and firewall rules. Intended audience This article is intended for customers who have migrated their systems to use RHUI v3. New Red Hat VM templates Certain Red Hat templates within the UKCloud public catalogue are automatically configured to receive updates from UKCloud's RHUI. The templates are: RHEL6.Latest - UKCloud-RHEL6 RHEL7.Latest - UKCloud-RHEL7 RHEL8.Latest - UKCloud-RHEL8 These templates have the following properties: Red Hat Update Infrastructure enabled for standard packages VMware Tools / Guest Customization enabled 60GB disk space / 1 x vCPU / 2GB RAM (default, adjust as required) Note To configure the root password for the VM, Guest Customisation MUST be run. You can adjust the VM properties as required and you'll be billed per the standard VM sizes as described in the UKCloud Pricing Guide . You will not be billed on additional storage until you reach the 60GiB of provisioned disk space. Old Red Hat VM templates If you've already deployed a Red Hat VM using the old templates, you can configure it to access the latest RHUI by following the steps in How to install Red Hat Update Infrastructure (RHUI) on an existing virtual machine (RHUI v3) . Additional resources High Availability (HA) is a premium Red Hat service, therefore you'll need to notify UKCloud for access to HA repositories or bring your own licenses to support this service. If required, we can provide access to additional repositories such as Scalable File System, Load Balancer or Resilient Storage.

Before you attempt to establish connections to an Ubuntu repository server, you need to make sure your VMs can communicate with the Ubuntu server which exists outside of your cloud organisation. This may involve editing the NAT and firewall settings within your edge gateway to allow traffic to traverse into your virtual data centre (VDC). For how to do this, see the How to create NAT rules and How to create firewall rules . Assured OFFICIAL platform UKCloud's Assured OFFICIAL platform is internet facing, so you can either configure your VM to connect to the internet, and use standard update tools such as apt-get to talk directly to the publicly available Ubuntu repositories or you can use the UKCloud-managed repository servers. Elevated OFFICIAL platform UKCloud's Elevated OFFICIAL platform doesn't have native access to Ubuntu repository servers. To connect to an Ubuntu repository server for updates, you can use UKCloud-managed repository servers or a UKCloud Walled Garden. Prerequisites There are two prerequisites for accessing Ubuntu update servers: The VM must be able to resolve to the repository server DNS records (contact UKCloud Support for the IP addresses for the Elevated records). You can achieve this several different ways: Use internet DNS records to resolve the Assured repository server Configure an A record on your local DNS for the Elevated repository server Configure an /etc/hosts file entry with the appropriate information All VMs using the service must be able to access the repository servers on port TCP/443 (HTTPS). Ensure that you have configured SNAT and firewall policies on your edge gateway device. If you have any questions about this, contact UKCloud Support. Accessing Ubuntu update servers UKCloud-managed repository servers Note The repository servers listed below are accessible only from within the UKCloud network. We provide Ubuntu repositories for the 16.04 (Xenial), 18.04 (Bionic) and 20.04 (Focal) LTS versions of Ubuntu on both our Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL security domains, so that customers with Ubuntu VMs can get software updates. To do this, issue the appropriate command for your release of Ubuntu to download a repository list file to your apt sources directory. For 16.04: sudo wget -P /etc/apt/sources.list.d https://rh-cds.ukcloud.com/ubuntu/repofiles/ukcloud_xenial.list For 18.04: sudo wget -P /etc/apt/sources.list.d https://rh-cds.ukcloud.com/ubuntu/repofiles/ukcloud_bionic.list For 20.04: sudo wget -P /etc/apt/sources.list.d https://rh-cds.ukcloud.com/ubuntu/repofiles/ukcloud_focal.list We also recommend that you rename the default /etc/apt/sources.list file to reduce the likelihood of errors during the update process that stem from attempts to access the internet-based Canonical Partner repositories. To do this, use the following command: sudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.old Walled Garden Choose this option only if you want full control of Ubuntu updates and are already thinking of deploying a UKCloud Walled Garden.

For more details, see the UKCloud Service Status page . In preparation for this service improvement and go-live, in addition to the steps detailed in the remainder of this article, you'll also need to create additional edge firewall rules to allow access to the following IP addresses on port TCP/8530 and TCP/8531. Note that, for these new systems below, you do not need to allow TCP/443. Due to the changes above, once the switch-over from the old WSUS systems to the new WSUS systems happens (due on 30th November 2021), you'll need to append the SSL port (8531) to the FQDN of the WSUS systems. For example: https://wsus.frn.ukcloud.com:8531 Assured 51.179.212.114 51.179.215.210 For Elevated OFFICIAL IP addresses (and any other networks or zones), raise a service request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal Overview When you create a virtual machine (VM) running a Windows Server operating system, you need to register it with the UKCloud Windows Server Update Services to receive updates for it. Note UKCloud provides Windows updates for server operating systems and SQL. Before you establish a connection to the update service, you need to ensure your VMs can communicate with the update server, which exists outside your cloud organisation. This may involve editing the NAT and firewall settings on your edge gateway to allow traffic to traverse out of your virtual data centre (VDC). You'll need to open ports 443 and 8530 on your firewall to the update server. For more information on how to do this, see How to create NAT rules and How to create firewall rules . Configuring Windows update In this section you'll need to use the appropriate address depending on the location you're targeting. Open a console to the VM you want to update. Test connectivity to the update servers by opening an Internet Explorer browser window, then opening a connection to one of the update servers on: https://wsus.cor.ukcloud.com (Assured OFFICIAL, Corsham) https://wsus.frn.ukcloud.com (Assured OFFICIAL, Farnborough) For Elevated OFFICIAL, raise a Service Request via the My Calls section of the Elevated UKCloud Portal to get the appropriate IP address Note Ensure that you can resolve this name via DNS or via a host entry you have manually put into your VMs. If you require details on what IP address you need to put into your host file, raise a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. Ensure that you have the full certificate chain installed. If not, you may have to install the certificates into your VM manually. Links for Root CA and Issuing CA: https://www.digicert.com/CACerts/DigiCertGlobalRootCA.crt https://www.digicert.com/CACerts/DigiCertSHA2SecureServerCA.crt For Windows Server 2008: Select Place all certificates in the following store.

    "keywords": "How to install and use Red Hat Update Infrastructure (RHUI 3) Overview This article provides advice on how to update your existing Red Hat virtual machines (VMs) to target UKCloud's approved Red Hat Update Infrastructure (RHUI). As of November 2020, UKCloud implemented the latest version of RHUI to continue to provide automatic updates to our Red Hat customers on our Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL security domains. This provides benefits such as the reliable availability of patch updates and Red Hat approved OS templates without having to subscribe each VM to Red Hat. Significant changes from the old RHUI include the following: The RPM installer files no longer distinguish between Assured and Elevated. A single file (per operating system version) works in both environments (providing DNS resolution is configured correctly). Replication of packages between Assured and Elevated is significantly faster. Root CA signed SSL certificates are now in use for HTTPS communication to the RHUI Content Delivery Systems (CDS). Intended audience This article is intended for customers who have configured / intend to configure their systems to use to RHUI v3. Prerequisites There are two prerequisites for performing this operation: The VM can resolve the RHUI CDS DNS record rh-cds.ukcloud.com (contact UKCloud Support for the IP addresses for the Elevated records). You can achieve this several different ways: Use internet DNS records to resolve the Assured CDS Configure an A record on your local DNS for the Elevated CDS Configure an /etc/hosts file entry with the appropriate information All VMs using the service must be able to access the required CDS servers on port TCP/443 (HTTPS). Ensure that you have configured SNAT and firewall policies on your edge gateway device. If you have any questions about this, contact UKCloud Support. Installing Red Hat Update Infrastructure Locations Note These locations are accessible only from within the UKCloud network. You can browse the list of installer RPM files here or download the required files directly from the following locations: RHEL 6 Standard RHEL 6 ELS RHEL 7 Standard RHEL 8 Standard If you require the high availability (HA) package, raise a Service Request directly via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal and we'll provide you with a download location. VMs not currently configured to use any RHUI If your VM doesn't currently have any UKCloud repository configuration already in place and you have not installed either the old RHUI or the new RHUI RPMs: Download the appropriate file (listed above ) to your VM (or place the contents in an accessible location such as an NFS share or FTP server). Install the relevant RPM. For example, for RHEL7 Standard: yum install UKCloud-Client-RHEL7-STANDARD-2.0-5.noarch.rpm Clean yum and the cache and confirm the new repositories are available: yum clean all; rm -rf /var/cache/yum; yum repolist Update your system using the new repositories: yum update VMs using a previous version of RHUI If your VMs are configured to use the old RHUI (identified by an installation RPM being installed with a reference to IL2 or IL3 (original titles for Assured and Elevated security domains)), migrate to the new RHUI: Erase the old RHUI RPM. For Assured VMs: yum erase $(rpm -qa|grep IL2-Client) For Elevated VMs: yum erase $(rpm -qa|grep IL3-Client) Download the appropriate file (listed above ) to your VM (or place the contents in an accessible location such as an NFS share or FTP server). Install the relevant RPM. For example, for RHEL7: yum install UKCloud-Client-RHEL7-STANDARD-2.0-5.noarch.rpm Clean yum and the cache and confirm the new repositories are available: yum clean all; rm -rf /var/cache/yum; yum repolist Update your system using the new repositories: yum update Upgrading the RPMs to a newer version From time to time, UKCloud updates the versions of the RHUI installation RPMs due to new repositories being added that may prove useful to you. The latest installation RPMs will always be available here . However, if a new RPM is available, you don't have to upgrade if you don't want to use the additional repositories; your existing configuration will continue to work without issue. After downloading the appropriate file to the VM, you can use yum update to upgrade to the newer version of the installation RPM. For example, for RHEL7 Standard: yum update UKCloud-Client-RHEL7-STANDARD-2.0-X.noarch.rpm Where X is the new release. This will overwrite the files and certificates associated with the original RPM and allow the VM to access the new repositories. Troubleshooting The primary issues you may encounter are: Product signing key requirements You may be asked to confirm installation of Red Hat public keys on your first package install(s) if they are not already there. They are as follows: Fingerprint: 567e 347a d004 4ade 55ba 8a5f 199e 2f91 fd43 1d51 Package : redhat-release-server-7.5-8.el7.x86_64 (@anaconda/7.5) From : /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release` Fingerprint: 43a6 e49c 4a38 f4be 9abf 2a53 4568 9c88 2fa6 58e0 Package : redhat-release-server-7.5-8.el7.x86_64 (@anaconda/7.5) From : /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release You can verify the keys via Red Hat's Product Signing Keys page. Issues when erasing the old ILx-Client packages If your systems are still pointing to the old, decomissioned RHUI when you try to remove the corresponding RPM, you may receive timeout messages as follows: Timeout on https://rhua.skyscapecloud.com/pulp/repos/content/dist/rhel/rhui/server/x/xServer/x86_64/repo/os/repodata/repomd.xml: (28, 'Connection timed out after 30001 milliseconds') You can rectify this by executing the following when you erase the RPM (where x is 2 or 3, depending on Assured or Elevated): yum --disablerepo=\\* erase $(rpm -qa|grep ILx-Client) DNS failure Check the DNS lookup is working and you have the correct entry for Assured and Elevated. 443 not accessible Check your firewall configuration, including local firewalls ( iptables ) and edge gateway. Ensure you have the correct destination IP entry for Assured or Elevated. Incorrect version Ensure you have installed the correct RPM for your release.

    "title": "How to license Microsoft software on the UKCloud platform",
    "keywords": "How to license Microsoft applications/software on the UKCloud platform Overview Important It is your responsibility to ensure that you have a valid licence for any software installed on the UKCloud platform if applicable. Contact your Service Delivery Manager or raise a support ticket if you have any concerns regarding the licensing of your workload and any applications. Microsoft perform regular audits, and in the event that your workloads have been operating without the correct level of licensing in place, UKCloud reserves the right to apply retrospective billing for the missing licensing and to place the relevant licence orders against our SPLA agreement. This article provides information on how you can apply Microsoft licensing on our platform and the options available to you. UKCloud offers three ways to license Microsoft software for use on our compute platform, providing you with the flexibility you need to deliver your application workloads in line with Microsoft requirements and obligations: UKCloud can purchase licences monthly for you via our Microsoft Services Provider License Agreement (SPLA) or Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) Program. You can submit a Microsoft Licence Mobility Verification form to use your own existing licensing. This must be done before you use the application on the UKCloud platform. You can use your own monthly reported SPLA, for example if you have SPLA application licensing for SQL. In this case, you'll need to provide a confirmation to your UKCloud Service Delivery Manager or raise a support ticket and provide the SPLA details in case of an audit. Microsoft SPLA Microsoft SPLA is a Service Provider License Agreement. Licences are reported on a monthly basis under SPLA, are non-perpetual and UKCloud uses the per processor/per core model. The core model is ideal for a multi-tenant public cloud as although every physical core on every server will need a licence, an unlimited number of users can access the licensed product. Core licensing is required when the number of users cannot be counted or fluctuates. It's important to note that customers do not need to license SALs when UKCloud are licensing per core. UKCloud uses this method for licensing Microsoft Server, which enables us to charge customers per hour that their VMs use Microsoft Server. When using SPLA licensing, customers don't need to purchase Software Assurance as they'll automatically get the latest version rights and can choose any version of the operating system or applcation that suits their requirements. UKCloud has a wide range of versions available in the UKCloud product catalog and can make other versions available on request. It's important to note however, that customers don't get any of the other benefits that Software Assurance offers. Microsoft Server licensing To make the provisioning of Microsoft-based virtual machines (VMs) as simple and quick as possible, while remaining in line with our Microsoft agreement, all Microsoft Server licences must be provided by UKCloud. The standard licensing approach is for us to provide Microsoft Windows Server licences on a per hour basis. This is retrospectively billed based on your usage of an associated VM. Important You cannot bring your own Microsoft Windows Server licences for use on the UKCloud platform within the multi-tenant (public cloud) environments. For your Microsoft Windows Server‑based VMs in our multi-tenant environments, to use a UKCloud-purchased licence you must create all your Microsoft VMs using a Microsoft template from the UKCloud product catalog. If you prefer to create your Microsoft VMs using your own template, you must then register these VMs with our Key Management Server (KMS). See the How to license Windows VMs using the UKCloud Key Management Server article or Licensing Windows VMs using the UKCloud Key Management Server video for information about how to do this. The Microsoft Windows Server licence is invoiced each month, in addition to the cost of the VM, based on the VM's usage. We automatically bill the usage of Microsoft Windows Server per hour that the VM is powered on, and invoice you for your consumption of Microsoft Windows Server per month using the following pricing table: VM size SPLA Per hour per VM Academic Per hour per VM Micro, Tiny VM £0.013 £0.002 Small VM £0.025 £0.003 Medium VM, Medium High Memory £0.051 £0.007 Large VM, Large High Memory, Tier 1 Apps £0.149 £0.020 Due to the elimination of the discount for G-SPLA, there is now price parity with corporate SPLA. As a result, customers who may not have previously been applicable for G-SPLA are not impacted. Microsoft desktop licensing UKCloud offers a variety of ways for you to run and license Windows desktop workloads on the platform: UKCloud Desktop as a Service. A purpose-built VDI/remote working solution aimed at enabling customers to virtualise their desktop usage, including all of the licensing required. Details are available within the Knowledge Centre for more information. Purchasing Windows 10 Enterprise licences from UKCloud. As a Microsoft CSP, UKCloud is able to purchase and provide Windows 10 Enterprise licences for customers on a monthly basis, charged per month. To utilise this service, create a Service Request stating the number and version of licences required. Note For this subscription service to work, the devices or virtual machines that require Windows 10 Enterprise licences must be internet connected to enable the administrator to add users to the Microsoft portal and assign licences to the connected virtual machine or device. If this is not possible, the customer can purchase perpetual licences from their reseller and assign licences by adding licence keys, and then following the QMTH process below. Bring your own Windows 10 Enterprise licensing via Qualified MultiTenant Hoster (QMTH). As a Tier 1 direct CSP, UKCloud is an authorised partner on the QMTH program. The QMTH program enables you to purchase Microsoft 10 Enterprise licences and use them on our multi-tenant cloud platform. To bring your own licences, raise a Service Request stating the number of licences and your Microsoft subscription ID. For more information regarding the QMTH program, we have further details on the UKCloud web site If you want to use this option, raise a Generic Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal, detailing the VM names. In addition, you can also bring your own Microsoft desktop licensing for use on a dedicated single tenant cloud server such as Private Cloud. In this instance, contact your Account Director or Service Delivery Manager for further information. Options for all other Microsoft applications As stated, all Microsoft applications on the UKCloud platform must be licensed appropriately by either UKCloud or by using your own existing licensing. There are two options available to you: UKCloud's Microsoft licensing and usage billing. The standard licensing approach is for us to provide Microsoft licences on a per hour or monthly basis depending on the application. These are retrospectively billed based on your usage of an associated VM for each month. For this option to be valid, you must ensure that you have informed us of all Microsoft installations by raising a Generic Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal, detailing the VM names, the application and specific version/level. Not all applications are available using this option, and the Microsoft application list within this document states the eligibility of this option per application. Bring your own Microsoft licensing. If your organisation has an existing SPLA or Academic licensing contract with Microsoft, or if you want to license your Microsoft software directly, we can offer the option of your organisation using your own Microsoft software licensing. Note This is only possible with certain Microsoft applications and is not possible for Microsoft Windows Server as stated above. Before you install any Microsoft software onto a UKCloud VM, you must ensure that you purchase the correct licensing with software assurance and that you have completed the Microsoft Licence Mobility Verification process detailed in this document. The completion of the process is indicated by a signed confirmation sent to you from Microsoft Ireland. If you do not have software assurance, you will not be able to use the Microsoft Mobility option. The Microsoft Mobility option involves transferring the use of your licensing to UKCloud VMs, and therefore they cannot be used on other Cloud Service Providers or on your own hardware. However, if you discontinue the use of the application on the UKCloud platform and no longer require the licensing, this can be reverted for your use elsewhere. The Microsoft Licence Mobility Verification form is available on the Microsoft web site. You must complete this form and post it to Microsoft and not to UKCloud.

This summary states whether UKCloud licensing and/or Microsoft Mobility is available. This is not intended to be a complete list, but covers the most frequently requested applications. If the application you're looking for is not on this list, engage with your Account Director or Service Delivery Manager who will be able to help and advise you as to whether the software can be licensed and if so how. Microsoft SQL You don't need to purchase licensing for MySQL, SQL Express or PostgreSQL. However, if you're using SQL Standard or Enterprise for development purposes you're required by Microsoft to have valid licensing in place. SQL Developer can only be utilised on a shared platform to test the SQL element of a solution and cannot be used to provide end-user services. If you want to provide SQL services to end-users, SQL Enterprise or SQL Standard must be purchased. We can provide Microsoft SQL Standard Server licences on a per hour basis, Microsoft SQL Enterprise licences billed on a monthly basis or Microsoft SQL Web licenses billed on a monthly basis. These are retrospectively billed based on your usage of an associated VM, and the pricing is available within the UKCloud Pricing Guide . Microsoft SQL Web is currently priced at £10.95 per pair of cores per month with a minimum of 4 cores per VM. Note that SQL Web is only for use to support public and internet accessible web pages, sites, applications and services. You cannot use it to support line of business applications (for example, Customer Relationship Management, Enterprise Resource Management and other similar applications). Microsoft Mobility. This is a valid option for both SQL Standard and Enterprise. Under SPLA licensing you only need to purchase the SQL server licence and you do not need to purchase Server Access Licences (SAL). Failover rights. For any operating system environment (OSE) in which you run instances of the server software, you may run up to the same number of passive failover instances in a separate OSE for temporary support. The number of physical and virtual processors used in that separate OSE must not exceed the number of physical and virtual processors used in the corresponding OSE in which the active instances are running. You may run the passive failover instances on a server other than the licensed server. Office 365 UKCloud licensing. We're now able to provide Office 365 and Microsoft 365 subscriptions on a monthly basis under our CSP agreement. Contact your Service Delivery Manager or raise a Generic Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal, stating your Microsoft tenant ID (if available) and the number of subscriptions required. Microsoft Mobility. This is a valid option for Office 365 ProPlus licences as long as you have valid Software Assurance in place. To take advantage of this option, you must manage your Office 365 implementation and ensure you have the correct number of licences to reflect your user count. This option is available via the QMTH program, and more information is available on the UKCloud web site . You can use your subscriptions on the UKCloud platform using our QMTH programme as a direct Tier 1 CSP. Raise a Generic Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal, stating your Microsoft tenant ID and the number of subscriptions you want to use. Remote Desktop Server Access Licence There's a separate licence for Windows Remote Desktop Services (RDS) that you'll need to use, as the standard Windows license does not cover RDS. Also note that there's no concurrency within SPLA, so the total number of users provisioned to access the RDS environment will need to be licensed. UKCloud licensing. We're able to provide Microsoft RDS SAL on a monthly basis only. These are retrospectively billed, and the pricing is available within the UKCloud Pricing Guide . To use these licences, you must raise a Service Request prior to their use to register them on the UKCloud platform and provision a dedicated RDS licence server. To assign and validate the licences, we will need to arrange a session to connect to your server. Microsoft Mobility. This is a valid option for RDS licences. System Center We're unable to offer this on our public cloud platform in any form. It's available for customers running dedicated or Private Cloud environments, in which case it can be purchased via UKCloud's SPLA agreement. Please contact Support to arrange for System Center licensing to be implemented on 1 or more of your private hosts. SharePoint UKCloud licensing. We're not currently able to offer licences for this application. Microsoft Mobility. Sharepoint Server or Sharepoint Server for internet sites can be licensed through Licence Mobility, only if Software Assurance is in place. Once verified by Microsoft you'll be able to use the SharePoint software on the UKCloud platform. Office UKCloud licensing. UKCloud can offer SALs for this software. You need to inform us as to how many users will be accessing the application and we'll bill you on a per user, per month basis. This pricing is available on request as it is not currently stated in the UKCloud Pricing Guide . Microsoft Mobility. This is not available via Microsoft Mobility and must be provided by UKCloud. Visual Studio UKCloud licensing. UKCloud can offer licensing for this software. You need to tell us how many users will be accessing the software and we'll bill you on a per user, per month basis. The only versions of Visual Studio permitted by Microsoft are Enterprise and Professional. Microsoft Mobility. This is not available via Microsoft Mobility and must be provided by UKCloud. Other Microsoft Products Engage with your Account Director or Service Delivery Manager who'll be able to help and advise you as to whether the software can be licensed, and if so, how. Submitting a request to use Microsoft applications on the UKCloud platform You must advise us of your preferred method for licensing Microsoft applications. To use your existing Microsoft licensing or use licences billed by us on UKCloud‑provisioned VMs: Log in to the UKCloud Portal . For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal In the Portal navigation panel, expand the Support option and select My Calls . Click Go to My Calls Portal . Click New Service Request . Select Generic Service Request . Fill in the Service Request form, making sure to provide the following information in the Additional Details field: Whether you want UKCloud to provide licensing or bring your own The specific VDC and VMs to which you want the licensing to apply The software licences, version and quantity you require If want UKCloud to provide licensing, the date from which you want the licensing to commence. If want to bring your own licensing and your Microsoft Mobility application has been accepted, the date from which your licensing will take effect. (You must have completed the Microsoft Mobility verification process before choosing this option.) Note It is your responsibility to inform UKCloud Support if you rename a VM that has licensing applied or if you no longer require the licensing on one or more of the specified VMs. When you're done, click Review & Submit . Validation If you request to use your own licensing, let us know when you have submitted the Microsoft Licence Mobility Verification form and the support team will update our records. As soon as Microsoft confirm with us that the licences are available, your own Microsoft licensing will be utilised. If you were previously using UKCloud-provided SQL licensing, this will be stopped and you will no longer be billed by us for SQL. Microsoft may contact you to confirm that you have the correct number of licences in place to cover the number of Microsoft-based provisioned VMs supplied by UKCloud. Microsoft SQL Server images To install Microsoft SQL Server Standard or Enterprise edition, you can either use your own local images, or we can make an image available to you. To gain access to any images, you must either inform us so that we can bill you for the appropriate usage, or wait until we've received confirmation from Microsoft as per the mobility process. You can request access to images by raising a Service Request in the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. Responsibilities As soon as you've completed the form and the actions have been confirmed, your organisation is responsible for ensuring that there are enough eligible licences to cover the specified Microsoft-based VMs on the UKCloud platform. Microsoft audits Infrequently, Microsoft will require an audit of the SPLA software services delivered by UKCloud. This review is currently undertaken by Ernst & Young (EY), the independent audit firm selected by Microsoft to conduct this process. If you're required to participate in such an audit, you'll receive an email from UKCloud to provide the necessary data. To fulfil the requirements of this compliance audit and remain in compliance with the SPLA program’s rules and requirements, Microsoft will request that you enable UKCloud and EY to gather the necessary information from your restricted-access servers. To accomplish this, you'll need to run EY's Inventory tool Script , using Option 2 . After running the script, you should upload the results to UKCloud as per the instructions in the initial email. UKCloud will then handle the obfuscation of data before handing it over to EY. The zip file linked above includes documentation with information about the EY scripts, with Section 3.3 providing specific usage details of how to run and use the script to scan all devices in Active Directory. Note The MBSA signed between Microsoft and UKCloud includes a confidentiality clause, and the provisions of this clause are also applicable to these servers; only data associated to the deployment of Microsoft products will therefore be communicated to Microsoft.

You need to set up a connection with the KMS to enable registration. Setting up a connection with the UKCloud KMS Before product activation, make sure your VMs can communicate with the UKCloud KMS that exists outside your cloud organisation. To allow this communication, you need to create a source network address translation (SNAT) and firewall rule on your edge gateway: In the VMware Cloud Director Virtual Data Center dashboard, select the VDC for which server activation is required. In the left navigation panel, under Networking , select Edges . On the Edge Gateways page, select the edge that you want to configure and click Services . On the Edge Gateway page, select the NAT tab and create a new SNAT rule. Make sure that the Applied On field is set to reflect your network firewall tenant (NFT). In the Original IP/Range field, enter the IP address, CIDR or range of addresses you want to SNAT out. For the translated address, enter the external IP address of your edge gateway or one of your external IP address assignments. For more information about creating SNAT rules, see How to create NAT rules . Select the Firewall tab and make sure that an outbound rule exists on your firewall. Contact UKCloud Support for details of the Destination IP and Destination Port . For more information about creating firewall rules, see How to create firewall rules .

    "keywords": "Access to virtual machines on the UKCloud platform What access does UKCloud have to our running virtual machines and the memory they are using? Our default policy is that no UKCloud personnel have access to any of our customer's environments. We would need a specific, customer approved change ticket in order to gain access to a customers' environment if we are to assist them with resolving any issues. UKCloud provides compute in line with the NIST defined IaaS cloud delivery model, which means that we manage the components up to and including the hypervisor, but we do not manage the virtual machine (VM) or anything within it (for example, the operating system or local disks). Each customer has complete autonomy in provisioning their VMs and therefore has exclusive control over the security credentials they use for each VM. As UKCloud does not have access to these security credentials, our personnel have no ability to authenticate and gain access to customer VMs. UKCloud personnel do have access to the vSphere hypervisors, physical servers and storage in which customer VMs run, so that they can effectively manage and maintain the cloud platform. This does not give them access to individual VMs, but rather the underlying resource pool. What controls do you have in place to prevent access to our data, either on disk or in memory? UKCloud was one of the first cloud service providers to achieve NCSC Pan Government Accreditation to host government data classified up to and including UK RESTRICTED (IL3 under the Government Protective Marking Scheme) and is one of the few cloud service providers who maintain PSN Accreditation, as well as the approval of the Health and Social Care Information Commission (HSCIC) to provide access to HSCN and Personally Identifiable Data. This heritage means that we have mature and well developed security controls throughout our organisation. This encompasses robust and multi-tiered physical, logical and technical security systems and controls. Given the low-level access that UKCloud personnel have to the cloud platform, we have implemented a variety of interconnected controls which include people, process and technology. We have a comprehensive Role Based Access Control (RBAC) system, which ensures that only authorised personnel can access appropriate elements of the cloud platform as required to undertake the authorised tasks of their role In addition, UKCloud is subject to regular ITSC CHECK Tests which provide a comprehensive and in-depth independent assessment of technical and security configurations, and check alignment of the assurance of UKCloud to Service Definitions, published RMADS and appropriate UK Government and industry standards. UKCloud maintains a protective monitoring service aligned with NCSC Good Practice Guidance GPG13 and the prescribed protective monitoring controls PMC1-12. This ensures that UKCloud has a comprehensive and detailed audit log, tracking which personnel have accessed and performed tasks on the cloud platform. All UKCloud personnel are appropriately vetted and security cleared so that customers can be assured that engineers with access to the underlying infrastructure are operating at the highest levels of trust (for example, through vetting and clearance frameworks including like BPSS, SC, DV and NPPV). UKCloud benefits from a full-time internal compliance function, which regularly audits company functions and processes to assess whether they are being correctly followed (for example by maintaining clear evidence where customers request and permit UKCloud to access their VMs). Any non-conformance is documented, reported to Board Level, and followed up to ensure that effective remedial actions are implemented. Finally, to complement the high levels of security inherent within the UKCloud platform, UKCloud recommends that customers use appropriate controls within the VM or application, such as data at rest encryption (for example, Bitlocker or Becrypt), session encryption (for example, HTTPS or VPN), and the implementation of appropriate protective monitoring. UKCloud has produced extensive security collateral to explain how we provide an assured cloud platform, including our Government Security Classification Policy whitepaper, relevant evidence packs and RMADS. If you would like to discuss this further, we can arrange for an Account Director, a Cloud Architect or a member of the Compliance Team to contact you.

    "title": "Secure Remote Access FAQs",
    "keywords": "Secure Remote Access FAQs Service What is the service? The UKCloud Secure Remote Access (SRA) service: Is based on NCSC-approved CPA technology, including Cisco AnyConnect and Cisco VPN devices Provides secure two-factor authentication based on UKCloud-assured device certificates Has a walled garden architecture that enables you to deploy and manage appropriate systems in a DMZ, allowing secure, controlled onward access to workloads hosted on the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL security domain Is integrated with the UKCloud Protective Monitoring solution (aligned with GPG13) System administrators and mobile workers can securely access workloads running on Elevated OFFICIAL from locations that don't have alternative secure network connections such as PSN or HSCN. Do I have to buy other UKCloud services to use UKCloud SRA? Yes. UKCloud SRA is available only to customers purchasing other UKCloud services such as UKCloud for VMware, Cloud Storage or UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift. Is a free trial available for the service? The assurance requirements related to this service mean that we're unable to provide a trial for this service. How are licence packs applied for each of my SRA instances? Licence packs are applied on a per-SRA basis; that is, if you have two separate SRA instances (for example, one per site), then you'd need to have two separate licence packs. Does UKCloud provide the managed devices for using the SRA service? No. We don't provide them, but we have partners who can provide the managed devices and other services if required. If I plan to use SRA and a Walled Garden, can I use a single Walled Garden for both? It's best to use two separate Walled Gardens within the Cross Domain Secure Zone, to ensure compliance requirements are met. You can design a solution to use a single Walled Garden infrastructure, but you're likely to require a more intensive review during the assurance wrap process. You'll still be billed for both services. Can I connect to multiple virtual data centres (VDCs) from a single Walled Garden? Yes. You only need to implement a single instance of SRA, as a bastion host can provide gateway services to more than one VDC. The assurance wrap process will outline the scope of connected services. If you want to add additional services to your SRA service, you'll need to review your existing compliance documentation via the assurance wrap. Can I use the UKCloud's SRA solution from outside the UK? No. The nature of the UKCloud solution is that you must be using it from known endpoints inside the UK. If you have international access requirements, please contact your account manager to discuss alternative options. Application process What is the process for applying for an SRA solution? You can find the information you need in the UKCloud Portal Knowledge Centre. If you're new to UKCloud, you should contact the UKCloud sales team to discuss your requirements. What information must the application form include? As a minimum the application form must include: A business case explaining why you require an SRA solution The technical architecture of the solution incorporating the UKCloud SRA An assurance plan - your proposed approach to ensuring that risks are correctly identified, appropriate mitigation is implemented and residual risks are accepted so that both the customer and UKCloud SIROs can make an informed decision about the risks of the solution What is likely to be included in the assurance plan? The assurance plan includes: Validation of requirements by the customer (department SIRO) Evidence from the customer that end-user devices are configured and managed in line with minimum requirements (for example scope of PSN compliance with IA requirements) Evidence from the customer that users of the SRA service are vetted and security-cleared in line with minimum requirements (scope of PSN compliance with IA requirements) Confirmation by the customer that an appropriate security incident management process applies to the solution Confirmation by the customer that the service will be accessed from the UK only Confirmation by the customer and each individual user of agreement to the UKCloud Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) Identification of data flows between the walled garden and the customer's solution (firewall access control list) What requirements are placed on the access devices? The service is compatible with customer-managed end-user devices that meet the following conditions: Mandatory use of Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client or an embedded IPsec client that is assured under the NCSC CPA scheme (or equivalent standard) against the IPsec VPN for remote working software client security characteristics Mandatory user-to-device authentication ensuring only authorised users can access the end-user devices Mandatory user-to-service authentication ensuring only authorised users can access the SRA service Mandatory device-to-service authentication ensuring only authorised end-user devices can access the SRA service Mandatory use of a platform that supports platform integrity and application sandboxing to reduce the risk of the end-user device being compromised Mandatory use of application whitelisting to reduce the risk of malicious code execution on the end-user device Mandatory use of regularly updated anti-malware software to reduce the risk of malicious code execution on the end-user device Mandatory use of enterprise-enforced security policies ensuring that end-users cannot override or reconfigure security-critical features Mandatory use of external interface protection such as host-based firewalls to limit exposure of the end-user device to untrusted networks Mandatory use of a device update policy to keep the end-user device regularly updated with security patches Mandatory implementation of an incident response plan by the customer organisation to respond to security incidents such as loss of the end-user device Configuration and management of end-user devices must be assured by the consuming organisation as being in line with NCSC end-user device guidance and compliant with PSN IA conditions Recommended use of a CPA-approved (or equivalent standard) data-at-rest encryption solution Recommended use of Secure Boot where available Recommended use of an enterprise audit and monitoring service by the customer organisation to ensure security events are centrally logged and reviewed How long will the assurance process take? Each business case and proposed solution will be assessed by the UKCloud team, and must be approved by the UKCloud SIRO. We aim to carry out the assessment within five days of receiving the business case and proposed solution, but we can't commit to timelines for approval. What is the assurance wrap review? If you need help gathering appropriate evidence, or effectively designing your SRA solution, we offer an assurance wrap review to guide you towards an effective design that will help to maximise your chances of meeting compliance requirements. The variable nature of the engagement means we charge for the assurance wrap on a SFIA Rate Card basis, depending on the number of days' support needed. What is the assurance process for approving an SRA solution? Broadly, the assurance process is as follows: Initial application UKCloud design review (with a cloud architect) Proposed evidence pack submission (by the customer) Full evidence pack submission (by the customer) UKCloud SIRO review and approval or rejection Full details of each stage are available in the Knowledge Centre or from your account director. Does the UKCloud assurance process replace the assurance requirements of any networks a solution may be connected to? No. The UKCloud SRA service is designed to facilitate connectivity to services hosted on the UKCloud platform only. If your solution needs to face an external controlled-access network, such as PSN or HSCN, you must complete the appropriate compliance for that network. What are the ongoing requirements? When the SRA service is in operation, you are responsible for ensuring continuing compliance with Security Operating procedures (SyOps) and other security obligations. Who makes the final decision to allow or deny the use of SRA? The UKCloud SIRO is ultimately responsible for deciding which solutions and configurations are allowed. Certificates How long do SRA certificates last for? SRA certificates last for 12 months. You'll need to renew certificates no later than two weeks before the certificates expire to avoid any interruption to your service. How do I order additional SRA certificates? To add additional certificates, raise a service request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal, selecting the \"Request Additional SRA Certificate(s)\" option. How do I renew or revoke an old certificate? To renew or revoke your certificate, raise a service request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal, selecting the \"Renew and/or Revoke SRA Certificate\" option. For renewals, it's important you give us at least two weeks' notice to prevent a break in your service. Can I renew or revoke my certificates in bulk? Yes. To renew or revoke your certificates in bulk, raise a service request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal, selecting the \"Renew and/or Revoke multiple SRA Certificates\" option. Attach the Secure Remote Access bulk renewal/revoke form (available here ) containing all the certificates you need renewing and/or revoking with details including User ID (UID) and certificate name. It would also be useful to provide host name or machine name. For renewals, it's important you give us at least two weeks' notice to prevent a break in your service. What are my responsibilities for this service? You need to maintain a list of your certificates and advise us if you need to request new or additional certificates as well as needing any to be revoked. Billing and legal How will I be billed? SRA has a minimum commitment period of three months and is billed monthly. The billing model has two parts: A per-user fee, bought in packs to cover your user base An hourly rental fee for each bastion host required to support your access requirements A small bastion host is provided free of charge each month per customer. If you decide to increase the size of this VM or provision additional VMs, you'll still receive the value of the first small VM free of charge per month and this will be deducted from the invoice if larger or additional VMs are used as bastion hosts. Is there a minimum term? The service is subject to a minimum term of three months. Termination within this initial term will incur an early exit charge. What does the cost of SRA include? SRA prices include: Access to managed NCSC-approved VPN gateways A Cisco AnyConnect licence for the end-user device Two-factor authentication using device certificates A walled garden virtual data centre, where you can deploy your application services A small VM to use as a bastion host (additional costs apply for larger or additional VMs) How will I be billed for the licences I use? We use consumption-based billing for licences, and these are in packs. You'll be billed for the tier you use in that month (that is, the number of active certificates you have for your devices). For example, if you usually operate with nine certificates for an SRA instance, you'd be billed for a 10-pack of licences. If, one month, you run a project that requires three more certificates for additional engineers, you'd be billed for a 25-pack of licences for that month. When you go back to nine certificates for your usual engineer access, you'd go back to being billed for a 10-pack of licences. For more information about the different licence packs, see the UKCloud Pricing Guide . Security Why does use of CPA-approved solutions to access the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL environment via the internet require approval by the UKCloud SIRO? UKCloud offers two ways to connect to the UKCloud platform's Elevated OFFICIAL security domain via a CPA-approved (or equivalent standard) solution: By using the UKCloud-managed SRA service (covered in this FAQ) By hosting self-managed CPA-approved (or equivalent standard) VPN solutions (see below) CPA-approved (or equivalent standard) VPN solutions have undergone a less rigorous NCSC assurance process than CAPS-approved solutions. NCSC recognises that there is therefore greater risk associated with the robustness of these solutions. As some PSN-accredited solutions (such as the UKCloud solution) host multiple customers, UKCloud has a responsibility to ensure that these less assured solutions are used appropriately. Therefore, you must have a compelling business case to justify why the use of CPA-approved (or equivalent standard) solutions is necessary. This business case is reviewed by the UKCloud SIRO (and periodically inspected by the PSN Accreditor) who will approve its use if appropriate. For clarity, CPA-approved (or equivalent standard) VPN solutions may always be used to provide an encryption overlay on a CAS(T) compliant circuit. It's only the use of these solutions over non-CAS(T)-compliant circuits (for example, the internet) that require approval by the UKCloud SIRO. Can I use UKCloud SRA to connect to the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL security domain? Yes, subject to compliance with information assurance requirements. Our SRA service is designed to enable you to connect via the internet to your services hosted on the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL security domain, by using a CPA-approved VPN solution and other NCSC guidance such as Walled Gardens. All traffic between the end-user device and the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL security domain must be routed through a Walled Garden hosted within the UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone. UKCloud is required to validate your ability to comply with information assurance requirements, which is why use of this service is subject to approval by the UKCloud SIRO. Refer to the UKCloud SRA service description on the Digital Marketplace for more information. Can I use UKCloud SRA to connect to other PSN services? No. The UKCloud SRA service is designed to facilitate connectivity to services hosted on the UKCloud platform only. Consider PSN-compliant remote access services if you require access to the broader PSN.

    "title": "Getting Started Guide for Secure Remote Access",
    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for Secure Remote Access Overview Intended audience This document is for customers who have: Completed the UKCloud Assurance Wrap Been approved to use the Secure Remote Access (SRA) service to manage services in the Elevated OFFICIAL security domain on the UKCloud platform Post approval Once the SRA Assurance Wrap has been approved, we'll raise a Service Request for the implementation of the SRA virtual data centre (VDC) and, if needed, an Elevated VDC. (If a service request for this VDC implementation already exists, a new one won't be raised.) You can track the progress of the Service Request using the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. During creation of the UKCloud SRA VDC, we'll ask you for some additional information via the Service Request: Confirm the customer account number in Elevated as a new Org will be created under the account to contain the SRA VDC. The Org number will be used as an identifier when signing certificates. The preferred IP pool you want to use for your client devices. If the IP Pool you'd prefer is in use by another customer then another will have to be chosen. We'll inform you if this is the case. If you want to specify an IP from the IP pool for each device, we'll need you to supply the mapping. Any specified DNS servers. The Elevated Network Firewall Tenant (NFT) number and the Elevated organisation containing it for connection into Elevated. A certificate signing request for each remote access device. Certificate signing request generation To enable SRA access, we'll need the certificate-signing request (CSR) from each remote access device you'll be using. The certificate-generation process will vary depending on the OS of the client device. Windows Follow the steps below to generate the CSR for a Windows device. Open the Certificates MMC snap-in (click Start , click Run , type mmc and then press Enter ) select Certificates and then Computer Account . In the console tree, double-click Personal and then click Certificates . On the Actions menu, point to All Tasks , point to Advanced Options and then click Create Custom Request to start the Certificate Enrolment wizard. Click Next . On the Custom request page, in the Templates list, we recommend using the Custom Request option as your domain policy may be incompatible with the SRA service. Select Proceed without enrolment policy and click Next . Select (No template) CNG key and ensure the PKCS#10 radio button is selected, then click Next . At the Certificate Information page, click the down arrow next to Details then click the Properties button. Click the Private Key tab, then the down arrow to the right of Key options . Change the Key size to 2048 and click Apply . Optional: If you want to back up the certificate (to protect against client device failure) click the check boxes for the private key . You'll be asked for a password. For the file format, select Base 64 and then save the CSR. Linux For Linux, an equivalent OpenSSL command would be the following: openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout myserver.key -out server.csr Ensure that the key file is preserved for the later installation steps below, as without this the AnyConnect client will not be able to connect the SRA service. CSR submission to UKCloud We request that you paste the contents of the CSR file directly into a ticket for us to generate the associated certificate(s), but you can also email it to us if you cannot access the Portal. VPN Cisco AnyConnect client setup To access your SRA VDC you need to raise a service request to acquire the Cisco AnyConnect client and install (requires UKCloud Portal login). For each OS there is the main Cisco AnyConnect client software install and an additional executable to enable the FIPS capability. You need to run both. Linux Install the AnyConnect client tar zxvf anyconnect-linux-64-<version number>-k9.tar.gz cd anyconnect-<version number>-/vpn sudo ./vpn_install.sh Enable FIPS tar zxvf anyconnect-linux-64-<version number>-enableFIPS.tar.gz ./ anyconnect-linux-64-<version number>-enableFIPS Windows Install the AnyConnect client The windows installation has the option of .msi or .iso (that contains the .msi ) for the AnyConnect client image. The following installs may need to be run as administrator depending on the local policy of your Windows device. Right click on the anyconnect-win-<version number>-pre-deploy.msi and select Install. Enable FIPS Double click anyconnect-EnableFIPS-win-<version number>.exe and then enter y when asked at the command prompt. Mac No further instructions required. AnyConnect client software We'll make the latest Cisco AnyConnect client software available via the Knowledge Centre using the link above. Using the latest version of the AnyConnect client will probably be a requirement of your ITSHC or service assurance wrap so it will be worth checking the above articles periodically. If a client is upgraded from a previous install then the following post installation steps will need to be performed again to ensure the client configuration isn't reverted to the default. Post-installation configuration Once you've installed the AnyConnect software and certificates on your device, you need to install the connection profile, which is available from UKCloud Support. Unzip the file and copy the xml to the following location: OS type CPA XML location Linux/Mac /opt/cisco/anyconnect/profile Windows C:\\ProgramData\\Cisco\\Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client\\Profile For Linux only In addition to the AnyConnect profile, you also need to install a local policy, which is available from UKCloud Support. Unzip the file and copy it to: /opt/cisco/anyconnect/AnyConnectLocalPolicy.xml . Once you've copied the connection profile and local policy to the correct locations, you need to restart the AnyConnect service (using the command service vpnagentd restart ) or reboot the VM. SRA certificates Once the SRA VDC has been set up (and Elevated VDC, if needed), we'll send you an email containing the certificates we've generated (based on the CSR sent to us as above) which you need to install onto your remote access devices. For each customer SRA service a unique IssuingCA certificate is generated and used to sign each individual device certificates. The IssuingCA certificate along with the specific certificate for the device will be emailed. Both the certificates need to be installed. The certificates sent through will named as below: IssuingCA – clientcert.pem Device Certificate - E51FFC7D50C<HEX VALUE>.pem Windows certificate store Follow the steps below to import the certificates into the Windows certificate store. This assumes that you have the certificates we sent accessible to the MMC: Open the Certificates MMC snap-in (click Start , click Run , type mmc , and then press Enter ) select Certificates and then Computer Account . In the console tree, open Trusted Root Certification Authorities , right click Certificates and select All tasks – Import - Next . Click Browse , change the filter from **X.509 Certificate ( .cer, .crt) to All files . Find the IssuingCA sent to you, double click clientcert.pem and click Next . Ensure that the Place all certificates radio button has Trusted Root Certification Authorities selected then click Next then Finish . In the console tree, open Personal , right click Certificates and select All tasks – Import - Next . Click Browse , change the filter from **X.509 Certificate ( .cer, .crt) to All files . Find the device certificate sent to you, double click E51FFC7D50C .pem and click Next . Ensure that the Place all certificates radio button has Personal selected then click Next then Finish . Using the example customer SRAS-1-1-2 you should now see the client certificate in the Personal store. Double click it and as in the examples pictures below: In the General tab it should say \"You have a private key that corresponds to this certificate\". The UID should be displayed the Details tab in the Subject line in the format SRAS-1-1-2- The certification path listed in the Certification Path tab as highlighted in the example below should show the IssuingCA Linux certificate store The Linux certificate store is just a file structure under the root or user account depending on how you use Linux OS. For the Linux client to work the following must be true: All certificate files must end with the extension .pem All private key files must end with the extension .key A client certificate and its corresponding private key must have the same filename. For example client.pem and client.key Using the example customer issued certificate SRAS1-1-2-001.pem the files would be stored in the following locations for root. The key file generated above needs to moved and renamed appropriately. PEM file certificate store folders Type of certificates stored ~/.cisco/certificates/client/private/SRAS1-1-2-001.key Private keys ~/.cisco/certificates/client/SRAS1-1-2-001.pem Client certificates ~/.cisco/certificates/ca/clientcert.pem Trusted CA and root certificates Connecting to SRA Once connected to your SRA VPN, you can access your SRA walled garden via IP address or DNS name (if you have a DNS set up). Client connection methods are listed below. Linux Once you've restarted AnyConnect and installed the certificates, you can use the client with the following command line: /opt/cisco/anyconnect/bin/vpn connect sra01.ukcloud.com Or if you use a Linux desktop the client software should be available as an icon. Windows When you open the AnyConnect client you'll see a small window appear and the location of the SRA service should be populated: Click the Connect button and after a couple of status checks the client should scan the certificate store and offer the relevant certificate to initiate access. Select the certificate and click OK . Accessing the UKCloud Portal using SRA There is no direct access to the Elevated portal once the AnyConnect client connects. In most instances we'll create a virtual machine (VM) within the SRA VDC that you can VPN into in order to log in to the Elevated portal to provision and manage your SRA and Elevated VDC. Once this VM is deployed, it becomes your responsibility to manage and maintain it. This VM will be billed according to standard UKCloud billing process. To obtain addresses for the Elevated portal and vCloud API, raise a Service Request through the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal.

    "keywords": "Pricing information for Secure Remote Access Overview Secure Remote Access (SRA) pricing can be as low as £5.00 per licence per month (regardless of how many days it is used in the month). Full pricing with all options is available in the UKCloud Pricing Guide . The pricing model for SRA has two parts: A per-user fee to cover your user base, bought in packs of 3, 10, 25, 100 or 1,000 licences. An hourly rental fee for each bastion host required to support your access requirements. A Small bastion host is provided free of charge each month per customer. If you decide to increase the size of this VM or provision additional VMs, you'll still receive the value of the first Small VM free of charge per month and this will be deducted from the invoice if larger or additional VMs are used as bastion hosts. What's included? The price of SRA includes: Access to managed NCSC-approved VPN gateways Cisco AnyConnect licences for end user devices Two-factor authentication using device certificates A Walled Garden virtual data centre where customers can deploy their application services All SRA deployments require a bastion host to complete the connection to the Elevated OFFICIAL security domain. UKCloud includes a Small VM as part of the monthly licensing cost. If you require a larger VM size, you'll be charged for the difference in cost between the free-of-charge Small VM and the size you require. There's no limit to the number of hosts you can provision in SRA. Pricing example Remote access pack: 10 licences Bastion hosts: 1 Medium VM Block storage used: 80GiB Tier 2 block storage Protection option: 14-day Snapshot Protection Licence costs A 10 licence remote access pack costs £500 . Bastion host cost SRA includes a Small VM for a bastion host free of charge. The difference in cost between a Small and Medium VM is £0.11 per hour. 14-day Snapshot Protection for a Medium VM costs £0.19 per hour. In an average 730 hour month, the monthly bastion host cost works out as: Hours in operation x (VM + Protection) = VM cost per month 730 x (£0.11 + £0.19) = £219.00 Storage cost per month A Medium VM includes 60GiB of free Tier 2 block storage, so an additional 20GiB is chargeable. Tier 2 block storage costs £0.10 per GiB month. 14-day Snapshot Protection for Tier 2 storage costs £0.10 per GiB per month. (Storage + Protection) x GiB used = Storage cost per month (£0.10 + £0.10) x 20 = £4.00 Total basic cost Calculate the total basic cost by adding together the monthly licence, bastion host, VM and storage costs. Licence costs Bastion host cost + Storage cost per month = Total basic cost £500 £219.00 + £4.00 = £723.00 Additional pricing notes 60GiB of Tier 2 storage is included in the pricing for all VMs while they are powered on. For VMs in a powered-off state, consumed storage will be charged at the prevailing rate. VMs with additional allocated storage will be charged at the prevailing storage rate regardless of their powered-on/off state. Billing and payment information Billing for the service is one month in arrears. Payment can be made by direct bank transfer. You can find bank details for payment on your invoice. Termination fees SRA is subject to a minimum term of three months. Termination within this initial term will incur an early exit charge. Free trials The complex assurance requirements for SRA mean that we're unable to offer a free trial for this service.

    "title": "Secure Remote Access Service Scope",
    "keywords": "Secure Remote Access Service Scope About this document This document describes the boundaries of the Secure Remote Access (SRA) service, along with the division of responsibilities between UKCloud and the customer, to facilitate the provisioning and ongoing use of the service. About Secure Remote Access The Secure Remote Access service enables customers to securely connect to the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL security domain using National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)-approved internet VPN technologies and the walled garden architectural pattern, using bastion VMs. You can create your own VMs and data flows across the SRA in order to satisfy your access requirements. Application process Customers wanting to use SRA need to go through the CDSZ Application Process. Customers will have two options when purchasing an SRA service: A light-touch design review/self-assessment route for customers with simple implementations, or those who are experienced at designing secure solutions. An assurance-wrap style approach with UKCloud's experienced professionals for more complex implementations or those customers who would like support and guidance when developing their solutions. Both options require the same submission documentation to enable UKCloud to provision the service. This is documented in UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone application process . Service architecture SRA utilizes Cisco AnyConnect as the underlying VPN technology. UKCloud manages the VPN termination and the certificate generation and revocation. The customer will manage the installation of Cisco AnyConnect and installing the certificates onto authorized devices. The SRA walled garden is a VMware-only environment, utilizing VMware Cloud Director as the management orchestrator for the service. An SRA walled garden is a virtual datacenter (VDC) in which you can build virtual machines and virtual networks in order to inspect and protect data moving between Assured and Elevated cloud environments. You can find more information about architecting an SRA environment in the Getting Started Guide for Secure Remote Access . An SRA walled garden is a VMware only environment, however you can connect it to non-VMware cloud environments within UKCloud, such as Oracle or OpenStack. UKCloud will provision one free-of-charge Small VM within the SRA walled garden to allow customers access to the Elevated Portal in order to manage the SRA walled garden. Customers may choose to delete this VM once they have configured their own access VM. Storage options All SRA workloads include 60GiB of Tier 2 storage for free. All storage is persistent and resilient to local hardware failures. You can purchase additional storage to support your application. You can use multiple storage options to support different aspects of the application. Tier 1. Our most performant storage for workloads requiring consistently higher disk throughput Tier 2. Persistent block storage with typical performance characteristics for use by production applications or storage Storage policies We provide you with access to two storage policies: Tier 1 and Tier 2. Both policies have a 1TiB soft-quota of storage. We do not guarantee storage performance, as it can be affected by many factors We do not provide IOPS figures for our storage offerings Workloads can use multiple storage profiles Protection Customers have a range of automated, on-platform protection options to choose from for their environments: Catalogue and template-based recovery. All customers have access to catalogue and template-based recovery as standard. This is a configuration management solution that can re-provision stateless servers to a new VM when required, using standard, and catalogue-based VM templates. Snapshot Protection. 14-day or 28-day snapshot policies available. Data protected by the snapshot has an RPO of 24 hours, with RTO determined by the time taken to restore the VM after the service request is raised. See the Snapshot Protection Service Scope for full details. Service availability The service level agreement (SLA) for SRA workloads guarantees 99.90% availability. You're entitled to claim Service Credits for outages to services that take you out of SLA. For more about how we calculate SLAs, see the SLA Definition . Service background We maintain the standard VM template sizes that control allocation of CPU and resources. VMs are fully provisioned. The system is configured to automatically balance resources, so your VMs may vMotion between physical hosts. To maintain performance across the platform, UKCloud can perform movements/migrations of VMs, vApps or storage within the infrastructure assigned to a service. We maintain the VPN termination devices. We manage the generation and revocation of digital certificates for the VPN. We actively capacity-manage the cloud platform to ensure you have access to the resources you request. We control the deployed versions of technology on the platform. This covers internal platform-supporting technologies, and any technology versions available to you. Internally this includes, but isn't limited to, the vSphere and ESX versions, and the hardware version of the platform. Externally this includes the available versions of the edge gateway and VMware Cloud Director. Promiscuous mode is disabled. You can make additional configurations inside a VM (such as acting as a secondary hypervisor or implementing third-party software technologies). We do not support customer implementations inside a VM. Service resilience You can specify Farnborough or Corsham as the site where you'd like to have your SRA service provisioned. We'll try to accommodate requests and will advise you if we are unable do so. You can set affinity or anti-affinity rules through VMware Cloud Director so that VMs do, or do not, run on the same physical host. Operating systems Licensing We can provide: OS licensing through the SPLA and academic frameworks for Microsoft Red Hat Enterprise Linux licensing For the latest available licences, see the UKCloud Pricing Guide . You can bring your own licensing for Red Hat and certain Microsoft application licensing under Microsoft Mobility using software assurance. You should inform UKCloud via a Service Request if you're providing your own licensing for a retrospective discount. For non-UKCloud issued software, you must obey the licensing requirements of the software provider. This includes being aware of any constraints around using the software in a virtualised environment. VM server images We provide base VM images for the operating systems for which we provide licensing. You can access these from VMware Cloud Director. You can use your own images for non-Windows and RHEL services, where licensing stipulates that to use the VM on our platform it must be licensed (and reported back to the software vendor) by UKCloud. Update services We make update repositories available for all software for which we provide licensing. We don't provide software update facilities for non-UKCloud licensed software. Anti-virus We do not provide anti-virus software as part of the service. Networks From a customer management experience, you manage all your connectivity rules, such as firewall, IPsec VPN and NAT functionality, through your edge gateway, using either the VMware Cloud Director tenant portal or vCloud API. You can find more information about networking within the SRA walled garden in the Getting Started Guide for the Cross Domain Security Zone Walled Garden . Edge gateway By default, we assign two edge gateways per SRA walled garden VDC: one facing the VPN termination devices and one facing Elevated. You can have up to nine Org VDC networks per edge gateway. vApp edge vApp networks enable you to create smaller networks within individual vApps that have a vApp edge, similar to the edge gateway on your VDC. Although a vApp edge isn't as feature rich as an edge gateway, it lets you create firewall and NAT rules to separate your VDC networks from your vApp VMs. See How to create a vApp network for configuration details. Site-to-site IPsec VPN You can create IPsec VPN tunnels to connect from SRA walled garden edges to virtual firewalls in Assured or Elevated. There is a limit of 64 tunnels per edge gateway. Load balancing The edge gateway acts as a basic layer 3 load balancer, including features such as session persistence and health checks. If you need more advanced load balancing, you should consider a third-party product. Protective monitoring We have implemented GPG 13-aligned Protective Monitoring across the Assured and Elevated security domains at the hypervisor level and below. We can provide Protective Monitoring services above the hypervisor (for example, for your VM) using our Security Operations Service . In line with UKCloud's SISP, we provide notification of customer-impacting security incidents. It is your responsibility to report similar incidents to us. Platform management Users can access, manage and view the SRA service, accessing only those features allowed by their role, in any of the following ways: vCloud API. Enables the programmatic creation and management of VMs inside the SRA walled garden. VMware Cloud Director tenant portal. Provides a graphical interface to access the VMware Cloud Director environment (depending on assigned permissions). UKCloud Portal. Enables the creation of compute services and subsequently VDCs and edge gateways. The Portal also includes an overview of actual and estimated spend, along with service configuration information. Access to incident and request management is also possible through the Portal. You cannot access the underlying infrastructure. This includes (but isn't limited to) the hardware and the vSphere environment. Service reporting Visibility Maintenance notifications and Service Status reports are delivered through the Portal. Billing We provide you with monthly bills covering your monthly spend. Customer service Cloud Architect. UKCloud Cloud Architects support you during the design of solutions for the cloud platform. UKCloud Cloud Architects are ideally placed to help reconcile your requirements with the UKCloud platform. We recommend engagement with a Cloud Architect when implementing an SRA walled garden. Service Delivery Manager (SDM). An assigned point of contact who will provide any assistance you require during your use of the service, including onboarding, service reviews and incident reporting and escalation. Support Desk. After the initial on-boarding and design phase, you can utilise the standard UKCloud support entitlement, which is documented in the Customer Engagement Factsheet . Customer responsibilities You are responsible for: Assessing whether the UKCloud platform can support the various requirements of your application. Completing and submitting an SRA application form in order to be granted access to an SRA walled garden. The control and management of access and responsibilities for end users including appropriate connectivity, security and accreditation if required. Managing the devices used for access to the SRA service, including patching and anti-virus on the device. Installation of the Cisco AnyConnect software on your devices. We are responsible for providing software and updates. Installation of the certificates on your devices in order to connect to the SRA service. If you require onward connectivity to government secure networks within Elevated (RLI or PSN), you are responsible for adhering to the relevant Code of Connection (CoCo) and for providing evidence of your CoCo to UKCloud upon request. UKCloud is unable to provide access to secure networks where such evidence has not been provided by the customer. Management and administration of layers above the hypervisor (OS patching, application performance monitoring, user administration). Ensuring only lawful data that supports the UK Public Sector is stored and processed by applications on this environment, and that you fully comply with the UKCloud Security Operating Procedures (SyOPs) and other information assurance requirements as specified in the UKCloud System Interconnect and Security Policy (SISP) and associated accreditation documentation sets. Service provisioning Within 4 hours of accepting an order (shorter deployment times are typically achieved and can be prioritised upon request), UKCloud will create the customer's Primary Administrator account and send a Welcome Pack, which includes the URL for the UKCloud Customer Portal, and the Getting Started Guide. Customers will have two assessment options when purchasing an SRA service. A light-touch design review/self-assessment route for customers with simple implementations, or those who are experienced at designing secure solutions. An assurance-wrap style approach with UKCloud's experienced professionals for more complex implementations or those customers who would like support and guidance when developing their solutions. Both options require the same submission documentation to enable UKCloud to provision the service. Deployment time following validation of the assurance document set is 5 days. This includes the setup and configuration of customer specific firewall requirements. UKCloud has created several videos, help guides, manuals and FAQs to help train and instruct users so that they are up and running quickly and easily. These are available within the Knowledge Centre.

    "title": "UKCloud for VMware FAQs",
    "keywords": "UKCloud for VMware FAQs Service What is the service? UKCloud for VMware is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering that enables organisations to rapidly provision and scale secure virtual machines (VMs) in minutes, in a flexible and autonomous manner. UKCloud provides this service across two security domains, Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL, and with a range of service levels offering up to 99.99% availability. This choice enables customers to precisely match application and user needs to an appropriate security domain, service level and cost, instead of designing to the highest level which may not always be needed. Can VMs have different characteristics? Yes. We offer three VM Types: ESSENTIAL, POWER and PRIORITY. VM characteristics are inherited from the virtual data centre (VDC) the VM is deployed in. It is not currently possible to have a VDC that has mixed VM types. However, customers can use multiple VDCs to deliver their solution. Are VMs contended? ESSENTIAL VMs are contended: VMs contend for memory and processor resources. POWER & PRIORITY VMs: UKCloud has implemented a combination of technical and process controls (for example, an ISO 20000-certified capacity management process) to ensure that these VMs don't contend for memory or processor resources. POWER VMs operate where automated rebalancing is enabled to pre-emptively optimise performance and availability. PRIORITY VMs differ from other VM types. Automated rebalancing is configured to reduce workload movement around the platform, reducing workload disruption. Can a VM communicate to another VM of a different type? Yes. VMs can communicate with each other. In some cases, customers may need to use the built-in self-service IPsec VPN functionality to create a virtual private network within our Assured cloud platform. Can VMs types be changed? Yes, but the customer must first export the VMs, then import them back into the VDC that has been created with the target VM type. Can I convert from one VM type to another, without having to move VMs between vDCs? Customers can manage the migration between VM types. Customers can also move vApps and VMs between VDCs as long as they're in the same assurance domain, for example Assured to Assured. More complex migrations, from the Assured to the Elevated security domain, must be managed by UKCloud. If you want to migrate a vApp larger than 1.5TiB, you'll need to engage the UKCloud support team to facilitate the process. To do so, raise a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. What hypervisor do you use? UKCloud's environment is built using VMware vSphere, the most ubiquitous and mature hypervisor available. Secure multi-tenancy is achieved with VMware Cloud Director. Can I have a read-only account in vCloud for monitoring? This is available on the UKCloud Portal under permissions that can be set by your account administrator. Virtual machines (VMs) Do I get root access onto the local VM? Yes, as this is a true IaaS cloud service, you have complete control and autonomy over each VM, and so have full root or administrative access. What VM sizes are available? UKCloud offers a variety of T-shirt sizes to meet customers' needs. The smallest configuration is 0.5GiB and 1 vCPU. The largest is 128GiB memory with 12 vCPU. Check the UKCloud for VMware Service Definition for more details on the currently available sizes. Note UKCloud for VMware does not currently support custom-sized VMs outside the T-shirt sizes, however if you require more flexibility with regards to VM sizes, we advise the use of our other multi-cloud technologies such as OpenStack, Oracle or Azure. Alternatively, you may consider the use of Dedicated Compute v2 to build custom-sized VMs. Can I resize a VM? Yes, you can change vCPU, RAM and storage allocations via the self-service vCloud Director/VMware Cloud Tenant Portal and vCloud API. You can add or remove processors and memory from VMs if the OS supports the 'hot add' capability. Increasing CPU or memory allocations may result in the VM being billed at a higher rate. Additional VM storage can be allocated instantly and will be billed on a per GiB basis. What is the speed of each vCPU? This is set at 2GHz for all VMs except Micro sized VMs, which can be restricted to run at 500MHz. What is the fastest way of importing large amounts of data onto the UKCloud platform? The speed of data transfer to the UKCloud platform isn't guaranteed. However, during tests of the upload and download speeds, an average of 8 Mbit/s was achieved for VM import/export and 40 Mbit/s for data transferred over FTPS. For a transfer time calculator, go to: https://techinternets.com/copy_calc?do If you use FTPS to upload data to or download it from your environment, you can transfer up to 1TiB of data in a day. Alternatively, we offer the Mass Transfer Facility option enabling customers to import large quantities of data via NAS, HDD or USB devices that are plugged directly into your environment. Please check the Mass Transfer Facility Service Scope or the UKCloud Pricing Guide for further details. Does UKCloud offer encryption on the VM? UKCloud for VMware provides always-on data at rest encryption (D@RE) in Regions 13 and 14. In other regions UKCloud can supply licensing for HyTrust DataControl. Alternatively, you can implement encryption using the technology of your choice inside the VM's operating system. Does your data at rest encryption solution provide FIPS 140-2 or Common Criteria certification? We use Pure Storage for our data at rest encryption solution in regions 13 and 14, which is FIPS 140-2 and Common Criteria certified. Is UKCloud's encryption service available for UKCloud for VMware? Not currently as a service (see above). We're considering this as an option, so please provide feedback by sending an email to feedback@ukcloud.com . Is it possible to non-fast-provision vApps, and to convert current vApps into non-fast-provisioned ones? Fast provisioning is enabled only by customer request - by default, all vApps are non-fast-provisioned. Customers can right-click on a VM and consolidate. This can also be done by raising a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. What is Dedicated Compute? Dedicated Compute comprises physical hosts assigned to a customer for their sole use. They're managed using the standard tools and services in the UKCloud platform. Dedicated Compute enables customers to: Comply with legacy licensing requirements from software suppliers whose licensing is based on a physical CPU (such as Oracle or desktop operating systems) Build bespoke sized VMs on the UKCloud platform Dedicated Compute uses the same storage infrastructure as the shared compute platform. There's a longer deployment lead time for Dedicated Compute, as well as a longer contractual commitment than our shared cloud platform (one month rather than one hour). For more details, see the Dedicated Compute v2 Service Definition . Note Dedicated Compute is available only in UKCloud regions 5 and 6. Can I utilise multiple storage types with my VM? UKCloud offers two storage types to customers: Tier 1 which is a fast storage offering Tier 2 which is a standard storage offering With Tier 1 and Tier 2 storage, customers can utilise both types to deliver their solutions - including running VMs utilising disks on different storage types. Can I change between storage types associated with the VMs I've deployed? If a customer has both Tier 1 and Tier 2 storage profiles available, they can self-migrate between these storage types. What happens when I switch off my VMs using the guest Operating System? If you shut down your VM using the guest OS, we will recognise this as a 'Power Off' event and you will not be billed while the VM remains in this state. Billing will resume once the VM is powered on again. How do I change the workload type of a VDC? To change the workload type (for example, ESSENTIAL, POWER or PRIORITY) of a VDC, you must raise a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal, and the support team will make the necessary changes. Please note this change is disruptive and UKCloud will be required to power down all VMs in the VDC during this transition. Networking How many IP addresses do I get? You're initially allocated five external IP addresses with a new compute service. You can ask for more external IP addresses by raising a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. Please note that there is a £20 charge per additional IP address. There's no limit to the number of internal IP addresses (RFC1918) you can allocate. How many PSN IP addresses do I get? Customer organisations are initially allocated one external PSN IP address. You can request additional external PSN IP addresses by raising a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal should a valid business requirement arise. Please note that there is a £20 charge per additional IP address. There's no limit to the number of internal IP addresses (RFC1918) customers can allocate. What firewall services are available? UKCloud controls and manages a perimeter firewall on the edge of our Assured cloud platform which securely segregates traffic. Within the UKCloud for VMware environment, we provide you with a dedicated self-managed virtual firewall that delivers typical firewall functionality such as access control lists and network address translation, as well as basic load balancing and support for VPNs. You can also use your preferred firewall and security appliances, as long as they're compatible with the VMware virtual infrastructure used to power the UKCloud Assured cloud platform. UKCloud also offers the additional benefits of a Distributed Firewall (DFW). An advanced security feature, DFW enables you to create security groups based on VM names, IP address and groups, which in turn enable the creation of firewall rules that are pinned to the VM. This makes firewall rules portable and simplifies the configuration and application. DFW is part of UKCloud for VMware's Advanced Management bundle. How do I create and manage firewall rules? Your UKCloud-provided dedicated virtual firewall is managed exclusively by you. You can set and manage firewall rules via the VMware Cloud Director tenant portal and vCloud API. On-boarding guides and associated video tutorials are available to help customers configure and manage their firewalls. Can I bring my own firewall? Customers can choose to deploy the firewall technology of their choice. This service, how to order it, and the constraints it may place on operation, is fully documented within our Knowledge Centre. What is the Advanced Management bundle ? The Advanced Management bundle includes Distributed Firewall (DFW), Distributed Logical Router (DLR), Layer 2 VPN and vROPs Tenant Monitoring and Metrics. Note The Advanced Management bundle may not be available in all regions and zones. The bundle is enabled at an organisation (vOrg) level, therefore all VMs within the organisation will be uplifted. See the UKCloud Pricing Guide for details. How does UKCloud provide urgent maintenance notifications and incident reports? You can view these, as well as general service status information on the UKCloud Service Status page . Do you offer dynamic or static IP addresses? The external IP addresses are static. Internal IPs can be assigned statically from a pool, manually or dynamically via DHCP. Are external Domain Name System (DNS) services available? No, we don't currently offer this service. You can implement your own DNS servers within your solution, or configure your virtual firewall to enable connectivity to an externally hosted DNS server - for example, one hosted on a government secure network such as PSN, Janet or HSCN; or one available on the Internet such as Google 8.8.8.8 . Are domain name registration services available? No, we don't currently offer this service. Some government secure networks (such as PSN and HSCN) offer domain name registration and DNS hosting as part of their service. For internet-facing services a third-party DNS provider will be required. Is Network Time Protocol available for time synchronisation? Yes, this is available for Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL. See Network Time Protocol server access for details. Can UKCloud provide SSL certificates or can existing SSL certificates be used? UKCloud doesn't provide SSL certificates, but you can use your existing ones. Some government secure networks (such as PSN and HSCN) provide SSL certificates as part of their service. Do you offer load balancing? Yes, you can configure load balancing within the service and it is included within the price. Supported protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, TCP. Supported algorithms: Round Robin, IP Hash, URI, Least Connected. Can I deploy my own load balancer? Yes, you can deploy your own load-balancing virtual appliance (for example, F5, Stingray, Zeus) if support for other algorithms is required. In addition, UKCloud offers Neustar UltraDNS from UKCloud - an authoritative DNS and global load balancing service, which you can customise for your own specific requirements. An FAQ and Service Scope are available in the Knowledge Centre. Storage How much storage do I get with a VM? A VM comes with a default amount of 60GiB of Tier 2 storage. The exception is Micro sized VMs. These have a fixed 10GiB allocation that cannot be increased. If this allocation is exceeded, the VM is treated as Tiny. Can I reallocate storage across VMs? No, storage pooling isn't possible. Each VM must have a minimum of 60GiB (except Micro VMs). You can quickly and easily allocate additional storage via the self-service VMware Cloud Director tenant portal or vCloud API. Additional storage is charged on a per-GiB basis as listed in the UKCloud Pricing Guide . Is storage persistent? Yes, unlike some other cloud platforms, storage is persistent. This means that your data and VM configuration remain available to you even if the VM is switched off or restarted. What is the Tier 1 storage solution? Tier 1 storage is designed for the following scenarios: Applications that require improved performance when accessing stored data such as high activity databases Applications that have irregular usage patterns that require a consistent performance such as data warehouses or batch process applications Existing applications can take advantage of Tier 1 storage. A migration process may be involved. Tier 1 storage is available for use with all VM types and compatible with all protection technologies. Talk to your UKCloud Account Director or Cloud Architect to understand if Tier 1 storage can benefit your solution. What are independent disks? Independent disks are a technology provided natively by VMware Cloud Director, and are included as options by default in the UKCloud service. They can only be created via the API, and cannot be created though the user interface. UKCloud has provided some advice on how to create and control them here . Independent disks are stand-alone virtual disks that you create in organization VDCs. Administrators and users who have adequate rights can create, remove, and update independent disks, and connect them to virtual machines. When you create an independent disk, it is associated with an organisation VDC but not with a VM. After the disk has been created in a VDC, the disk owner or an administrator can attach it to any VM deployed in that VDC. The disk owner can also modify disk properties, detach it from a VM, and remove it from the VDC. The system administrator and organisation administrator of the organisation that contains the VDC have the same rights to use and modify the disk as the disk owner. Only one VM can be connected to an independent disk at a time. Why have independent disks started to appear on my bill? Previously, independent disks appeared on customer invoices when they were actively attached to a VM. This meant that customers continually mounting and dismounting independent disks may not have seen the true size of their UKCloud for VMware environment. We have improved our reporting to advise customers of the independent disks they have currently created, and the amount of storage associated with those disks, and the monthly cost associated with those disks. What if I use my independent disks with the same VM all the time? We advise that you move the data in the independent disk into a disk associated with a single VM. This will enable you to take advantage of the free 60GiB of storage included with all UKCloud VMs. What rate are independent disks charged at? Independent disks will be charged at the rate of the storage they are stored on, along with any additional protection applied (Journaling or Snapshot Protection) and charged at a rate per GiB per month. Can I use the 60GiB included with my VM on an independent disk? No, as an independent disk can be mounted to any VM inside a customer's VDC, so is not associated with a single VM. How much included storage do I get with Dedicated Compute? You will receive the same allowance as for UKCloud for VMware VMs. For example, 60GiB of Tier 2 storage when the VM is powered on for free. Please note, when the VM is in a powered off state any storage associated with the VM will be charged at the prevailing rate. Management How do I access my systems? You can access your VMs using: The remote console through the UKCloud Portal Remote access protocols (RDP/SSH) over a VPN or secure network What reports can I get about VM performance? You can monitor VM performance using standard tools within the operating system. Additionally, UKCloud provides retrospective performance information via its Portal API. Does UKCloud patch the VMs? No, customers are responsible for the patching of their services. We make a patch repository available to customers for VMs on the Elevated OFFICIAL security domain (which cannot connect to the internet) for common operating systems that we provide. How do I access support and patches for operating systems that UKCloud licenses? UKCloud provides a repository of patches for common operating systems for customers to access and update from. Please refer to the Knowledge Centre for details. For support, you'll need to log a request with UKCloud, who will log the ticket with the relevant supplier. UKCloud will then inform you about any updates. However, UKCloud isn't responsible for the actual resolution of non-IaaS issues. Do you have a Key Management System (KMS) for activating Windows? Yes, a step-by-step guide on configuring and using this service is included in How to license Windows VMs using the UKCloud Key Management Server . How do I control a VM? You control a VM via the VMware Cloud Director tenant portal or vCloud API. Controls include stop, start, restart, load media, clone, snapshot, and so on. Do you monitor VMs? UKCloud monitors the underlying platform but doesn't monitor customers' operating systems or applications. Customers can implement their own application performance monitoring solutions within the VDC. Do you offer autoscaling? There's no standard product offering for autoscale, but the platform API can be used to do this with a little developer effort. How quickly can I scale my service up or down? Horizontal scale can be achieved quickly by adding additional VMs (usually in just a few minutes). Vertical scaling can be achieved by 'hot adding' vCPU or RAM to a VM (where supported by the guest OS). This operation usually takes seconds. Licensing, software and anti-virus What operating systems are available? UKCloud UKCloud for VMware is powered by VMware technology, so is compatible with a wide range of x86/x64 operating systems. VMware provides a compatibility matrix at: https://partnerweb.vmware.com/comp_guide2/pdf/VMware_GOS_Compatibility_Guide.pdf . You can use the UKCloud catalog of operating systems or upload your own. We offer Windows Server 2012, Windows 2016, Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS. Note On 14 January 2020, Microsoft ended support for Windows Server 2008, therefore we highly recommend that you upgrade to Windows Server 2012 or Windows Server 2016 to remain secure. In addition, we provide access to common templates provided by the Bitnami service such as Drupal, Joomla, LAMP and Wordpress. How can I license an operating system? Microsoft Microsoft terms and conditions preclude customers from using their own licence agreements for Windows Server in the Cloud. That means all licensing for Windows Server operating systems must be provided by UKCloud. Microsoft offers License Mobility, a scheme that allows a customer to provide additional software such as Exchange, SQL and so on, as long as the customer has appropriate Microsoft licensing as per the licence terms and conditions and usage rights. In order to use License Mobility, you must complete the form that is available in the from the Microsoft web site and send this by post to Microsoft. For more information, see How to licence Microsoft applications/software on the UKCloud platform . If you require SQL licensing to be provided by UKCloud, this can be done by completing a Service Request from the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. SQL standard licensing is charged per hour per VM, whilst SQL Enterprise is charged monthly per VM. It is essential that UKCloud are informed of every instance of SQL on the platform, and that you complete a Licence Mobility form for all licences that you use on the UKCloud platform. RHEL RHEL operating systems can be licensed by UKCloud or the customer. The customer is responsible for ensuring correct licensing for any other operating system they chose to install. If you want to use your own RHEL licencing, please raise a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. How up to date are the operating system images and mirrors? All CentOS, Ubuntu, Red Hat and Debian distributions include update mechanisms to install the latest patches and releases. For a list of supported operating systems, and instructions on how to access these update repositories, see the Knowledge Centre. What anti-virus do you offer on this service? UKCloud doesn't provide any anti-virus (AV) by default, so customers are advised to install their own AV software to protect their workloads. What applications are available as part of the default service? UKCloud does not offer any additional software other than what's included in the UKCloud Portal catalog. Any additional software, including its licensing, is the customer's responsibility. Are Open Virtualisation Format (OVF) VM images supported? Yes, you can upload OVF images to the platform, and you can download VMs built in the platform as OVF. What is Bring Your Own (BYO) licensing for Red Hat? BYO licensing for Red Hat enables customers to select VMs running on the UKCloud Assured cloud platform for covering by their own commercial agreement with Red Hat. UKCloud will remove the cost of the Red Hat licence from the customer's monthly bill for the selected VMs. Customers need to raise a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal to let us know which VMs they will cover with their own Red Hat licence. Support How do I raise a support ticket? The secure online UKCloud Portal provides most common service management functionality. Alternatively, you can contact support by phone or email. How do I manage my services? Services on the Assured OFFICIAL security domain can be managed over the internet (or other connectivity) via the UKCloud Portal. For the Elevated OFFICIAL security domain, security requirements are stricter and require either a PSN-approved connection, UKCloud Secure Remote Access or a self-managed CPA-approved (or equivalent standard) VPN solution (for example, site-to-site VPN). What are your service maintenance windows? See Understanding UKCloud service maintenance windows . Can UKCloud provide notifications for service status and maintenance? Yes, you can subscribe to the UKCloud Service Status page to be alerted to service status and maintenance notifications. Notifications can be via email, text, webhook or Atom/RSS feed. For more information, see How to subscribe to service status notifications . Onboarding How can I get started with the service? Within four hours of accepting your order, we'll create your primary administrator account, and send you a Welcome Pack, which includes the URL for the UKCloud Portal and associated authentication details. Your administrator can then create additional accounts for users within the project. Each user can then log on and begin using the service (depending on the security domain and connectivity). At the time of order, you can specify which of our two UK data centres you'd like to be deployed into. Meeting your request is at UKCloud's discretion. Is there a free trial? Yes, we offer a 30-day free trial so that you can test and evaluate our service without commitment. Your trial provides you with a live environment on the UKCloud platform to test our services and verify whether they are suited to your needs. How do I request a trial? You can request a trial via the UKCloud website: https://www.ukcloud.com/free-trial-sign-up and accept the trial terms and conditions. Your environment will then be set up and you will be given trial credits to the equivalent of £500. What do I do when my trial comes to an end? You will be contacted by your Cloud Architect or Service Delivery Manager (SDM) when your trial is due to end, either because you have run out of credits or reached 30 days (whichever is sooner). At the end of your trial, you have the option to transition to production or cease the trial. Protection Can I create a clone of my environment? Yes, you can do this through the VMware Cloud Director tenant portal. This operation can also be performed programmatically via the vCloud API. It's not possible to restrict the automated VM snapshot backup to specific files or directories. You can install your own backup service and use our Cloud Storage service if you need more flexibility. Can I still use Synchronous Protection for my VMs? Synchronous Protection is no longer available as protection option for UKCloud for VMware. We recommend using one of our other protection options: Journaling Protection or Snapshot Protection. We'll continue to provide support to customers who previously added Synchronous Protection to their environment. Snapshot Protection What are snapshots? A snapshot is NOT a copy of the VMDK. Creating a snapshot locks out the base VMDK file and any changes to the data are written to the snapshot delta VMDK. If you want to roll back to the point in time that the snapshot was created and discard any changes since, you can revert the snapshot, which essentially deletes it and discards any changes. If you are happy with the changes made since the snapshot was created, you can delete the snapshot, which essentially consolidated all changes back into the base VMDK. For advice on best practice regarding snapshots, see Virtual machine disk limits and considerations . You can create snapshots using the VMware Cloud Director tenant portal and these are stored in the same zone as the source VM. This is not to be confused with the UKCloud Snapshot Protection service, which uses a temporary snapshot to backup the VM to an external system in another UKCloud site. For further reference, Virtual machine data recovery options explains the different recovery options available to you through VMware Cloud Director. Can I restrict automated VM snapshot backup to specific files or directories? It's not possible to restrict the automated VM snapshot backup to specific files or directories. You can install your own backup service and use our Cloud Storage service if you need more flexibility. How quickly can a VM be restored? This depends on the size of the VM, the location from which it's being restored and the priority of the support ticket raised to request the restoration. You should expect recovery to take two to three days. If you require a faster recovery time, you must implement your own backup/restore solution, which will be entirely under your control. Our Cloud Storage service could be an appropriate target for self-managed backups using software such as CommVault and NetWorker. What rate are snapshots charged at? Snapshots will be charged at the rate of the storage they are stored on (Tier 1 or Tier 2), and charged per GiB per month. Can I use the 60GiB included with my VM for snapshots? Yes, you can use the 60GiB included with the VM for snapshots. If I have Snapshot Protection on Dedicated Compute, what will I be charged for? You will only be charged for the protection of the storage consumed, not the VM. Disaster Recovery Does UKCloud provide a DR service? Disaster Recovery as a Service (powered by Zerto) can help you improve organisational resilience. It enables rapid migration of applications between your local VMware or Hyper-V based VMs and UKCloud for VMware disaster recovery-enabled regions. An alternative UKCloud solution to achieve DR with a low RPO and RTO is Journaling Protection . How does UKCloud enable customers to create their own DR solutions? Although we've engineered our cloud platform to tolerate failures and ensure customers' services remain available, we encourage all our customers to design for failure and build DR capabilities into the system design, or into the application. To help this process, the UKCloud platform has been designed to give you the options you need to design a disaster-tolerant solution. UKCloud's platform is about providing customers with choice. Clearly, customers need to balance the low probability of these failure scenarios occurring with the cost and complexity involved in mitigating their impact. Depending on the type of failure you are trying to mitigate, UKCloud services have been developed to enable you to design appropriate resilience into your solution. At a macro level, UKCloud operate out of two sites. Designing across multiple sites will provide resilience against even the most unlikely of scenarios - including natural disasters and mass WAN failure. UKCloud currently offer two sites: The independent cloud platform at our Corsham site The independent cloud platform at our Farnborough site Each site also offers independent regions. These are physically segregated parts of the UKCloud platform that have an independent power and networking components - enabling customers to architect resilient solutions out of a single site. Services in different regions also have independent control planes. By architecting for separate regions, you improve your resilience to outages that effect the control and management of your VMs. Finally, each region has a number of distinct hardware zones. For customers looking to architect against mass hardware failures. Zones can be utilised to provide additional confidence in your ability to tolerate outages. For example, you can load-balance across two zones to ensure that your service stays online in the event of an unlikely outage. In some rare failure scenarios (such as DDoS or Split Brain) the availability of the cloud platform at both our sites may be affected. These scenarios can be mitigated by deploying across multiple cloud providers. Billing and legal What is the smallest unit of time I will be billed for? The minimum unit of time for use is one hour. Part hours will be rounded up. Dedicated Compute v2 has a minimum commit of one month. What are the charges to transfer data between VMs within the same data centre? None. Data transfer between VMs in this scenario is free. Will I be charged even if my VM is powered off? You will not be charged for any VMs while they are turned off, however while the VM is in a powered-off state, any storage associated with the VM will be charged for at the prevailing rate. This includes the 10GiB included with Micro machines and 60GiB in all other VM sizes of Tier 2 storage. How will I be billed for additional storage? You can allocate additional storage to VMs on demand. UKCloud will bill customers for additional allocated storage, regardless of the powered on/off state. Additional storage will also include storage used for templates and media items. What is a template or media item? Within UKCloud for VMware VDCs, you can deploy your own templates, media items or catalog images. These include templates for applications and operating systems. How can I view billing information? Billing information is available via the UKCloud Portal. How can I pay for the services? Payment for UKCloud services can be made by direct bank transfer (BACS/CHAPS). You can find bank details for payment on your invoice. What are the termination fees? There are no termination costs for this service. Customers are responsible for extracting their own data from the UKCloud for VMware if required. UKCloud may make an additional charge for transferring data out of the service. How is resource usage billed? Actual real-time resource usage is measured to the nearest second. At the end of each day, periods of time in identical VM state are grouped together and the total for each group in seconds is rounded up to the nearest hour. An identical VM state has the same power status, VM size, service level, storage size, protection and licence. Where rounding up of multiple periods in differing states during the same day would result in more than 24 hours of charges, the period with the lowest price per hour is rounded down. For example, if a VM was switched off for a total of 890 minutes but was on for 550 minutes, the billable hours would be rounded up to 10 hours for when the VM was on and the off period would be rounded down to 14 hours to cap the day at 24 hours. Will I be charged for creating snapshots? Snapshot Protection can be purchased with any VM and will be charged for in accordance with the UKCloud Pricing Guide . Self-service snapshots created within VMware Cloud Director will incur charges as of November 2017. These will be accounted for in the invoices you receive at the beginning of December. Security What data is suitable for the UKCloud assured cloud platform? The service is hosted in the UK and operated by UK government security-cleared staff. It has extensive independent validation (including NCSC design reviews) that it is fully aligned with the 14 NCSC Cloud Security Principles, and is therefore ideal for all data classified at OFFICIAL (including OFFICIAL SENSITIVE). Can systems on different UKCloud security domains communicate with one and another? UKCloud's Cross Domain Security Zone enables customers to use a customer-designed and managed Walled Garden to enable communication between platforms. For more information, see the Cross Domain Security Zone Service Definition . Is there a protective monitoring service? Protective Monitoring is included for our IaaS platform and follows GPG 13.

    "title": "Service failover testing FAQs",
    "keywords": "Service failover testing FAQs General How can I test that my services will failover? You can test the failover function of the service by requesting a Test Scenario from UKCloud. The Test Scenario is designed for the following uses: Customers that wish to test and understand how their applications might react in a failover where the underlying physical hosts have failed (simulated in the scenario) or when the VMs have been migrated in a live state. The Test Scenario is not: A customisable feature of UKCloud for VMware. This Test Scenario Service is limited by the following rules: UKCloud will only complete a test scenario for a maximum of 10 customer identified VMs. This provides you with an experience similar to what you would experience in a live fail over scenario. Test Scenarios will only occur during office hours. Customers will build and explicitly identify up to 10 VMs to UKCloud. The failover will be deemed a success by UKCloud once we can identify that the VMs are running in the second UKCloud data centre using its own monitors and tools. What is not included? UKCloud will not failover the connectivity and physical firewall during a test failover. You will experience a network latency of a few milliseconds through this firewall. What is the process to initiate a Test Scenario? Customer raises a Support Request indicating they wish to complete this test and confirming the VMs (up to 10) that they wish to be failed over, the start and end time, and any other requirements. UKCloud receives the request and responds accordingly with an accept or reject. If accepted, UKCloud will schedule the work to commence at the specified time. What options are there? Option 1: UKCloud will dynamically move customer VMs between two data centres UKCloud will dynamically move customer VMs between the data centres while the VMs remain online. There will be increased network latency between client VMs that are running in the different data centres (approximately 4-4.5 msec). Option 2: UKCloud will restart customer VMs between the two data centres Customer VMs can be shut down and restarted in the secondary datacentre. If the shutdown is a non-graceful (Power-Off as opposed to a Guest OS shutdown) then this simulates the effect of a physical server outage from an individual VM perspective. This is the equivalent of a total data centre failure. As the UKCloud platform is multi-tenanted, UKCloud will not replicate a physical host failure to invoke a DR scenario as this may impact other customers. Failovers will last a maximum of 12 hours before being failed back to the originating data centre. What outputs are available? It's highly likely that the testing of a failover will be seamless to the customer and therefore it will be difficult for them to gauge that the failover has occurred. To provide assurance that the test was successful, UKCloud will produce a report that identifies the following: A sanitised (removing ESX host names) report of the ESX servers that the VMs are located on during the period of the failover test Comments and observations Are there charges for a service failover test? Typically, UKCloud will only allow a test to last for 1 business day with a charge (based on the SFIA Rate Card - level 3 Apply). If you require longer testing periods, this needs to be approved by UKCloud. Why is the DR failover Test Scenario not fully automatic and self service? This is part of the service roadmap.

  "articles/vmware/vmw-faq-journaling-protection.html": {
    "href": "articles/vmware/vmw-faq-journaling-protection.html",
    "title": "Journaling Protection FAQs",
    "keywords": "Journaling Protection FAQs General What is Journaling Protection? Journaling protection (Powered by Zerto) is a powerful self-service replication and recovery tool that can improve organisational resilience. It can be accessed and controlled by using the fully-featured portal. How does it work? As indicated in the name, journaling protection utilises a \"journal\" for capturing every change that takes place inside an application. The contents of this journal are then stored in a different UKCloud Zone - which is nominated by the customer. The journal can span up to 28 days of a VMs history, with recovery points just seconds apart. Allowing for a near zero RPO. In the event of a disruption to service - either at the service provider level (loss of infrastructure), or something localised to the application (ransomware attack, problematic software upgrade). Customers can recover the VMs into their recovery site - either with minimal data loss, or to a specified point in time. How is it billed? Journaling Protection will be billed monthly in arrears and is dependent on the storage consumed, and whether virtual machines (VM) are protected on the UKCloud platform. To explain the billing of this service, please see the worked examples below: UKCloud virtual machine protection In the scenario that you are using the service to protect virtual machines on the UKCloud platform, you will be billed for: (Virtual machine cost per hour + Journaling cost per hour) * hours per month (Storage cost per month + Storage journaling cost) * Storage capacity For example: 1 Medium Power VM on the Assured platform available for 720 hours with 160GiB Tier 2 storage. As always, UKCloud include the first 60GiB of Tier 2 storage (10GiB on Micro) in the hourly price of a VM. However, any protection will apply to the base storage and any additional storage. In this example, the 60GiB + 100GiB = 160GiB. It is worth mentioning that if the base storage is upgraded to Tier 1 storage, this will be charged at the Tier 1 storage price. This would be calculated as: VM: (£0.22 + £0.10) * 720 = £230.40 Base Storage: £0.30 * 60GiB = £18.00 Additional Storage: (£0.10 + £0.30) * 100GiB = £40.00 Total: £288.40 Note, when a VM is turned off the 60GiB becomes chargeable and the customer will be billed for the total storage consumed. If the VM was turned off for the whole month, then the following calculation would apply: Storage: (£0.10 + £0.30) * 160GiB = £64 Total: £64.00 In an example where no additional storage is selected: 1 Medium Power VM on the Assured platform available for 720 hours with only the base 60GiB Tier 2 storage. This would be calculated as: VM: (£0.22 + £0.10) * 720 = £230.40 Base Storage: £0.30 * 60GiB = £18.00 Additional Storage: (£0.10 + £0.30) * 0GiB = £0.00 Total: £248.40 The charge if the VM was turned off for the whole month: Storage: (£0.10 + £0.30) * 60GiB = £24.00 Total: £24.00 What functionality is available? Currently, you can carry out the following actions using Journaling Protection: Define virtual protection groups (VPGs) that map to one or more vApp. These allow you to maintain a set of rules that apply to all VMs within the VPG. Rules include settings such as the journaling location and network mapping. State a desired location that the VM journal is to be stored in (for example, another UKCloud region). View the current RPO (recovery point objective) and RTO (recovery time objectives) for your protected VMs. Restore vApps (self-service) from a journal via the portal from any point contained within the journal. View real-time notifications within the Zerto portal to check if VMs are not meeting RPO or RTO targets. Perform disaster recovery tests by recovering vApps into the recovery destination. Can I set different retention policies for my vApps? Yes. Each vApp maps to a VPG, and each VPG can have its own retention policy. For example, you may have one VPG retention policy set at 2-day Journaling and another VPG retention policy set at 7-day Journaling. Is this a managed service? No. UKCloud have implemented Journaling Protection to be available for UKCloud for VMware workloads as an on-platform service and will ensure that the service is available and updated accordingly. Once the service has been available for your workloads, you will be responsible for managing the service via the UKCloud for Journaling Protection portal (powered by Zerto). How do I make changes to my Journaling Protection? Once the service has been provisioned for your environment, you will be able to log into the UKCloud Portal and then log into the Journaling Protection portal. Please note that our support teams will be unable to manage your service for you as this is provided unmanaged. How does this differ from Snapshot Protection? The Journaling Protection service provides a continuous log of all the changes that have occurred within your environment within the specified time frame (2, 7, 14 or 28 days) that are stored on the UKCloud platform and can be restored quickly and easily from a point in time of your choosing. Snapshot protection utilises 24 hour backups for up to 28 days which are stored on a separate storage solution, and can recover from deleted disks or VMs. In the event that you need to recover from a previous recovery point, there may be a loss of data due to the time difference between the event and the last snapshot. Will I be able to extend my retention periods by moving my journals to external storage, such as Cloud Storage? No. In the initial release, this feature will not be enabled as we have identified a security challenge that must be addressed. Will my network configuration be failed over in the event of disaster? Journaling Protection (powered by Zerto) will replicate vApp networking specific to a customer's vApp. However, organisation and external networking configuration would need to be done manually. Customers can do this ahead of any failure by pre-provisioning external connectivity within the recovery site. During setup for the DR site, is there a way to export the edge and vLAN configurations from the production site and import this configuration for the DR site? Yes. You can manage exports and imports of configurations via the API. You may also raise a support ticket and we will be able to assist with this process. Does the Journaling Protection swap drive work for bitlocker enabled drives? Swap disks are synchronised during the initial synchronisation, but no further ongoing synchronisation occurs. This means that the Bitlocker drive should remain encrypted and configured when failed over. However, if the password or key is modified then it will need to be reconfigured or re-encrypted in the event of a failover. To avoid this scenario, customers are advised to leave the Bitlocker drive marked as normal synchronisation (non-swap). Does UKCloud offer an SLA with Journaling Protection? We do not currently plan to offer an SLA around the service. However, the real time monitoring available in the Journaling Protection portal (powered by Zerto) will advise customers of the state of their journal and their currently achievable RPO. Is Zerto licensing included? Yes, it is included with the Journaling Protection option for use with the 2, 7, 14 or 28 day retention policies. Will a VPG still be protected if one or more VMs are powered off? We recommend that you do not power off a VM if it's included in a protected vApp. Although powering off a VM may not immediately affect the protection of the vApp, if Zerto attempts to access the powered off VM, it could cause replication of all the VMs in the vApp to cease. If a powered-off VM causes an issue with vApp protection, Zerto will issue an alert. If you add a powered-off VM to a protected vApp, the VM will not be protected until you've powered it on and Zerto has performed the initial sync. In this case, the powered-off VM will not affect the protection of the vApp. Is Journaling Protection enabled in all regions? Journaling Protection is currently enabled in all regions. However, only regions 5, 6, 13 and 14 are used as the recovery destination regions due to performance and capacity management reasons. To check the latest status as to which services are available in each region, see UKCloud services by region . Can I use Journaling Protection with VDCs that are in the same data centre? Yes, this is possible but dependent on which regions the VDCs are in. It is not possible to use regions 1, 2, 7 or 8 as the recovery destination regions for the journal. Can I use Journaling Protection to migrate workloads between regions? Yes, you can use our Journaling Protection solution to migrate your UKCloud for VMware applications into another VMware-enabled region. This enables you to move your workloads into the regions within our platform that are best suited for your requirements. The migration of VMs within our platform is very closely aligned with how we operate the Journaling Protection of VMs, with the only difference being that when you have failed-over the VMs to another region you do not then failback to the primary region. As migrating workloads involves enabling Journaling Protection on your source VMs, those VMs (and any associated storage) will incur the appropriate additional Journaling Protection charges for the duration of the migration. Once your migration is complete, you should be sure to remove the original VMs from the source site to avoid additional charges.

    "title": "Snapshot Protection FAQs",
    "keywords": "Snapshot Protection FAQs General What is a protection technology? Protection technologies are tools used to enable you to design resilience into your cloud solutions. They protect data and provide you with the ability to recover from system outages - either caused by a disruption to the physical delivery of a service or a result of a corruption of your primary system. What protection options does UKCloud offer? By default, VMs deployed on the UKCloud platform do not come with any protection services enabled. However, you can opt to utilise one of the platform based protection technologies, such as: Snapshot protection - automatically takes an image of your VM every 24 hours and stores the image outside the core platform Journaling protection - creates an almost live copy of your VM and records the VM data and state in a data journal Additionally, you can implement your own protection technologies. Utilising our Cloud Storage service, you can keep secondary copies of your data by: Manually copying data Using scripts to copy data Using backup applications such as CommVault, Networker and others. You can replicate data between sites for even greater data protection. Can I use my own protection client software? Yes, you simply install appropriate backup software within the VM and specify the backup location. A typical scenario might involve using a commercial backup solution (such as Symantec NetBackup, CommVault or EMC NetWorker) that points to services such as our Cloud Storage. Snapshot protection How does snapshot protection work? An automated VM snapshot creates a crash‑consistent snapshot of the VM, which is then copied to our dedicated backup system. How do I add snapshot protection to my VM? Use the UKCloud Portal to add snapshot protection to a VM: Login to the UKCloud Portal and choose the appropriate account. In the dashboard, click My VMs , then click the appropriate vOrg. Click the My VMs tab. Choose the appropriate VDC then click the VMs tab. In the Snapshot Protection column, click the Manage button. From the Select Backup Policy list, choose the policy level that you require: 14‑day or 28‑day , then click Submit . The button changes to indicate your chosen policy. You can also remove a VM from automated backups by choosing No Backup from the Select Backup Policy list. How long does it take before the first snapshot is taken? The time it takes to add snapshot protection to a VM varies depending on how many other requests are in the queue. While the request is processed, the button in the Snapshot Protection column changes to an amber Processing button. When the process has completed, the button changes back to green and will indicate the snapshot policy you chose for the VM ( 14‑day or 28‑day ). If the process fails, the button changes to a red Failed button. In this situation, contact the UKCloud support team to resolve the issue. The first snapshot will be taken in the next available backup window. Backup status information is typically updated daily on the UKCloud Portal by 10:00, but typically within minutes of the close of the backup window. Due to the higher rate of new data on a VM's initial snapshot backup, each new VM is automatically configured with 'overtime' enabled on it's first backup. This enables it to run to successful completion beyond the standard backup window (20:00-08:00) if required. This helps to ensure the initial backup completes on the first attempt, particularly for large or high change rate VMs. The flag is removed after the first successful backup. Can I change the snapshot policy for my VM at any time? Yes, there are no restrictions. After your changes have been processed, they will be applied to the snapshot taken in the next backup window. How are my automated VM snapshots restored? If you have access to the support ticketing system, you can request restoration of VMs. We'll restore the whole VM image to your virtual data centre (VDC). You can then manage the restoration of individual files or the whole VM. Do automated VM snapshots include my VDC configuration? Configuration of VDC items such as virtual firewalls, load balancers and virtual networks are backed up at a platform level, and cannot be restored on a per‑customer basis. You can create an individual backup of these items via the vCloud API. What is the automated VM snapshot frequency? Once every 24 hours. How long can I store a backup? Data is stored for 14 or 28 days, depending on the retention policy you choose. Can I set my own schedules? We do not currently support custom schedules. Can I take a snapshot backup against a VM on demand? Not with the UKCloud automated VM snapshot service. If you need to snapshot autonomously, you can install your own protection service and use our Cloud Storage service. Is the automated VM snapshot backup full or incremental? We take a full automated backup of the VM. Can I recover individual files using UKCloud's automated VM snapshot backup? To restore individual files, you need to extract them from the whole VM image that we restore to a new VM. You can access the new VM, find the data you want and transfer it to the original VM. Standard charges will be incurred for the temporary VM. Can I set a global policy for all VMs within a VDC? Yes. You can apply the global policy to new VMs created in the VDC or to all new and existing VMs. For the steps required to do this, see How to manage Snapshot Protection for your VMs . Can I change the snapshot retention policy for a VM? Yes, you can use the UKCloud Portal to change the snapshot retention policy. For the steps required to do this, see How to manage Snapshot Protection for your VMs . What type of data is the automated VM snapshot backup solution suitable for? The service is suitable for data certified as OFFICIAL and OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE and is available on both UKCloud platforms: Assured OFFICIAL (formerly IL2) and Elevated OFFICIAL (formerly IL3). Do large VMs affect snapshot backups? For regions 1, 2, 7 and 8, large VMs (2 TiB+) with high change rates are not recommended for Snapshot Protection, as the service will spend longer trying to establish what has changed and then attempt to back all of it up. You should take an alternative backup approach with VMs of this size in these regions. For regions 5, 6, 13 and 14, you can use Snapshot Protection for large VMs. However, you should still consider the impact of recovery time for large VMs. Can I restrict the automated VM snapshot backup to specific files or directories? No, this is not currently possible. You can implement your own protection solution if this is a requirement. Where is the protected data stored? By default, all snapshot backups are stored in the opposite site from the one that the VM is running in; so a VM running in Farnborough stores its snapshot in Corsham. You cannot presently request a preference to change the location. What SLA do you offer on snapshot backup success? There's currently no SLA associated with the snapshot backup service, although it is monitored 24x7. How do I restore data? You can request restoration of VMs only if you have access to the support ticketing system. To restore data, administrators can access the UKCloud Portal and, using My Calls , create a support ticket stating the VM and the backup schedule they want to restore. UKCloud operations then complete this task, restoring the entire VM image. How quickly can you restore a VM? The larger the VM, the longer the restore time: When restoring over the existing VM, restore times are reduced by the use of change block tracking. When restoring alongside an existing service, data restoration must start from scratch. Depending on the size of the VM, this can take many hours. Do I need to install any software on my VMs? The automated VM snapshot backup works directly with the cloud platform to capture the entire VM, so there is no need to install any software within the VM. We do recommend that you install VMware Tools on all VMs running on UKCloud for VMware. For more information, see VMware Tools installation . If a VM is deleted, how long will existing snapshot backups be retained? The UKCloud platform automates the deletion of backups as they reach their retention date. Therefore, 14 or 28 days after the VM is deleted, depending on your chosen profile, the last snapshot backup will automatically be removed from the platform and consequently be unavailable for restore. How and when am I notified of snapshot backup failures? Backup information, including failures, is updated daily on the UKCloud platform by 10:00, but typically within minutes of the close of the backup window. For the steps required to access the status of a VM's snapshot backup, see How to manage Snapshot Protection for your VMs . Note that we do not presently provide real-time alerting on individual VMs. What is the process for dealing with failures? UKCloud's internal monitoring tools provide us with advanced warnings regarding any backup failures. The UKCloud support team receives a daily report of snapshot backup failures. We'll raise a service ticket on your behalf and proactively investigate with you when: Any VM has a failure count of more than two Three or more VMs within the same VDC fail within 14 days What does the proactive investigation consist of? UKCloud's proactive corrective measures depend on the nature of the snapshot backup failures, but will generally follow this outline: We evaluate snapshot backup failures and look for emerging patterns. In the case of a repetitive failure, we'll raise a service request on your behalf. We'll conduct an investigation into the snapshot backup failure, and take appropriate mitigation steps. Should the failure persist, we may suggest a customer review to try to resolve the issue. If we identify that the snapshot backup service is incompatible with your application and intended usage, we'll recommend a session with a Service Delivery Manager or solution architect to work through alternative protection options. How and when are reruns scheduled? Backups are attempted during the hours of 20:00 and 08:00. A backup will not be reattempted in the same backup window, but will be included as normal in the next window. If a snapshot backup attempt is returned as a failure this will be reported to the UKCloud support team, and any remedial actions will be in place for the backup attempt in the next window. How is the automated VM snapshot backup service charged? The service is charged on a per VM basis based on: The size of the VM you are backing up The amount of additional data you are backing up The length of time those backups are held When I disable snapshot protection on my VM, will billing immediately stop? Billing stops immediately and you will no longer be charged regardless of the chosen retention period. In addition, you will no longer have access to any snapshots taken. If I have an existing VDC that includes snapshot protection, is protection automatically added to any new VMs I create? Yes, if the service level of your VDC includes snapshot protection (either selected for an Essential, Power or Priority VM or the former \"STANDARD\" or \"ENHANCED\"), that protection is automatically applied to any VMs you create within that VDC. You can still use the self‑service backup functionality within the UKCloud Portal to remove snapshot protection from a VM or change the retention policy without having to raise a Service Request. Can I set retention policies at a VDC level? Yes, you can set retention polices at a VDC level, meaning that all VMs within the VDC will inherit the retention policy set. What happens if I add VMs to a VDC that has a defined retention policy? All VMs that are created once a VDC policy is set will be automatically added into the protection policy. If you decide to change the VDC policy, you can choose to apply the new policy to ALL existing VMs in the VDC. Further details can be found in the Snapshot Protection Service Scope and guidance on how to apply protection to VMs and VDCs can be found in the How to manage Snapshot Protection for your VMs . Are snapshot policies automatically applied to VMs? Protection products are not automatically applied to VMs running on the UKCloud platform, therefore you must explicitly select the protection option that best meets your requirements.

    "title": "Synchronous Protection FAQs",
    "keywords": "Synchronous Protection FAQs General Is Synchronous Protection still available? Synchronous Protection is no longer available as a protection option for UKCloud for VMware. We recommend using one of our other protection options: Journaling Protection or Snapshot Protection. We will continue to provide support to customers who previously added Synchronous Protection to their environment, although we would encourage considering using Journaling Protection instead. What is the ENHANCED service? ENHANCED was a G-Cloud 7 service level option which was subsequently replaced with the product name \"Synchronous Protection\". However, for most purposes, Journaling Protection is more flexible. How is the environment protected? Any data that is written is committed to the underlying storage arrays in both UKCloud sites synchronously. This includes the full content of your VMs and edge gateway instances. For clarity, this is not an asynchronous replication technology and the recovery point is the last write to disk, with no historical recovery points. If asynchronous replication with historical recovery points is required, consider Journaling Protection . How is an unplanned failover event triggered? We monitor the underlying physical infrastructure, including the blades, routers and switches. In the event of multiple component failure, including loss of redundancy, in the majority of cases your VMs and edge gateway instances will be automatically brought online in the alternative site. However, other scenarios can result in a full or partial failover, and in these cases we'll need to react differently. What might I need to factor into my design? You need to be aware of what this service offers. The UKCloud Synchronous Protection service option: Is not designed to be active‑active. It offers failover to a second UK site. If you need an active‑active solution, you can build across both sites and design in load balancing. Contact your Account Manager if you want to investigate this option. Provides a disaster recovery service with an RPO of 0 seconds, and a variable RTO from 1 minute to longer, depending on the scenario. What will I need to do after an unplanned failover has occurred? In the event of an unplanned failover, because your VMs are restarted in a crash-consistent state, you may need to manually restart parts of your environment to ensure that your applications continue running as before. You may also need to check your external connectivity to ensure that all networking has been correctly rerouted. What is the impact on latency? A consequence of synchronous replication is that there is a higher write latency (time taken for a write to be acknowledged). This is primarily due to the time taken for the write request to occur on both sites. Typically, this means that writes take 15‑20ms (compared to 5‑10ms if Synchronous Protection is not selected). Depending on the workload, this may have a noticeable impact. If an application performs a large sequence of writes in series (one at a time), then the impact of the higher write latency will be felt. If, on the other hand, the application performs a number of writes in parallel (multiple writes at the same time), then the impact of the higher write latency will be significantly less. We highly recommend that applications deployed with Synchronous Protection are designed and configured to perform write operations in parallel. As a best practice, we would also recommend ensuring that the file systems are block aligned - that is of particular relevance with Synchronous Protection. Most modern operating systems are block aligned by default, but this may still be of relevance with the additional file systems created manually on Linux. If you are unable to architect your application to make use of parallel writes, and the increased latency cannot be tolerated, then you should consider alternatives to Synchronous Protection, utilising application replication for protection between sites. For clarity, Synchronous Protection makes no difference to read latency. How is the network rerouted? For internet-bound traffic, we manage an autonomous Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) service that enables us to intelligently redirect traffic without affecting your IP address allocation. The resilience of the external connectivity into the Elevated OFFICIAL security domain depends on, and is generally provided by, the access network. Behind the router layer, we have designed a network that stretches between our two sites. This allows for network connectivity (if installed in one site) to remain if your virtual firewall and our physical firewall are in separate and alternative sites. We advise that you consider how additional services, such as Cloud Enablement and leased lines, will be affected in a disaster recovery (DR) scenario, as this falls outside the Synchronous Protection service option. UKCloud's firewalls are protected within each site, with the failover between the sites performed via an orchestrated process. We achieve this through a sequence of routing changes within our network. How long will it take for my services to fail over? This will depend on the scenario and the design of your environment, but generally the failover will take as long as the VM needs to reboot plus a small amount of additional time to invoke the failover - about 45 seconds. Some scenarios, such as a \"split brain\", can take longer, leading to an outage of up to two hours. What is the relationship between edge gateways, VDCs and vOrgs when a failover occurs? When a failure occurs, edge gateways, virtual data centres (VDCs) and organisations and their inherent rules, are failed over with all other VMs. Can I ask for the VMs in my environment to be split between UKCloud sites? You cannot specifically request this as part of the service, but UKCloud retains the right to do this if necessary, such as during Planned Maintenance. Can I be alerted when a VM is moved to a different site? This feature isn't currently supported. However, you can check the location of your VMs. For more information, see How to use VM location . Failover testing How can I test that my services will fail over? You can test the failover function of the service by requesting a Test Scenario from UKCloud. For more information, see the Synchronous Protection Service Scope . Snapshot Protection Will I be charged for using Snapshot Protection if I opt for Synchronous Protection? Synchronous Protection with Geo-resilience comes with 14-day Snapshot Protection as standard when selected, with the option for 28-day Snapshot Protection free of charge. Please note that you will be charged for any storage consumed associated with the Snapshot Protection option if enabled.

    "title": "Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware",
    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware Overview UKCloud for VMware is a trusted, connected and flexible cloud, based on VMware technology, that enables you to either migrate existing workloads or create new workloads on our secure sovereign cloud platform quickly and easily whilst enjoying the economies of scale of the cloud. This Getting Started Guide helps get you up and running using UKCloud for VMware, providing basic information about how to log in and set up your environment. Intended audience This article is intended for any new UKCloud for VMware user. To complete the steps in this article you must have access to the UKCloud Portal and VMware Cloud Director. To build compute services and virtual data centres (VDCs) you must be a VMware Cloud Director administrator. Introductions to UKCloud for VMware We understand that each enterprise application has its own set of technical and service requirements that must be addressed on an individual basis. UKCloud for VMware is highly configurable and gives you the flexibility to use different service levels, VM sizes, security domains, connectivity and data protection options. You can build completely tailored solutions by mixing and matching service options. The choice doesn't lock you in to one service or size and you can always change it later. Services within UKCloud belong to an account, which in turn belongs to a company. A company can own multiple accounts. You can use accounts to create separate environments for different projects or, in the case of UKCloud partners, to create separate environments for different customers. Within an account you can have multiple UKCloud services, one of which could be UKCloud for VMware. You can have multiple instances of a service within an account. Logging in to the UKCloud Portal You access your UKCloud for VMware environment through the UKCloud Portal, so the first thing you need to do to get started is to log in to the Portal. The location of the Portal depends on the security domain your service is located in: Assured OFFICIAL: https://portal.ukcloud.com Elevated OFFICIAL: Contact your Portal administrator, your Service Delivery Manager (or servicedelivery@ukcloud.com ), or UKCloud Support (call 01252 303 300 and select option 2) You'll need your Portal credentials, which you should have received from your Portal administrator or the Service Delivery team. You may also need to set up two-factor authentication (2FA). For detailed instructions for how to log in to the Portal, and for more information about all the functionality it provides, see the Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal . Creating your UKCloud for VMware estate When you first access UKCloud for VMware, you'll need to create a compute service (sometimes called a vOrg) to act as a top-level container for your cloud resources. As your estate grows, you can add more compute services to logically organise your resources. Within your compute service, you create VDCs to contain your VMs. VMs in the same VDC share workload characteristics and have access to the same resources, such as networking infrastructure, storage and external connectivity. We recommend that you organise related VMs within vApps to make your applications easier to manage. For example, you can start all the VMs within a vApp with a single operation, rather than having to start up each VM separately. vApps are also useful to help maintain crash‑consistency within an application in the event of a disaster. Building a compute service If you have the appropriate permissions, you can use the Portal to create a compute service in your account, without having to raise a support ticket. Note You can also create a compute service using the Portal API. For more information, see UKCloud Portal API Reference Guide In the UKCloud Portal, select the account in which you want to create the compute service. In the navigation panel, expand Tools and then select Create Compute Service . On the Build Compute Service page, from the Zone radio buttons, select the zone in which you want to create the new compute service. Note To create a compute service using the Portal, your environment must be in region 5, 6, 13 or 14. Enter a Compute Service Name . Tip The name can be up to 32 characters long and can include any character except +. Click Build . The Build Compute Service Status page displays information about the compute service you're building and lets you know how the build is progressing. Tip You can stay on this page until the build is finished, or you can leave this page and check the status of the build later by going to the VMware Cloud Build History report. When the build is complete, the page displays either a success or fail message. If the build is successful, you can start building VDCs in your compute service (see Building a virtual data centre ). If the build is unsuccessful, raise a support ticket (quoting the Build ID ) to resolve any issues. Building a virtual data centre After creating your compute service, the next step is to create one or more VDCs. Note You can also create a VDC using the Portal API. For more information, see UKCloud Portal API Reference Guide . Note You can build VDCs in any of your compute services in regions 5, 6, 13 and 14, including those created by support tickets or the Portal API, not just those you created using the Portal. In the Portal navigation panel, expand VMware Cloud and then select the compute service in which you want to create the VDC. Note To create a VDC using the Portal, the compute service must be in region 5, 6, 13 or 14. From the Actions menu, select Build VDC . Note If this option is greyed out, either you do not have the appropriate permissions or your compute service is not in region 5, 6, 13 or 14. On the Build VDC page, from the VM Type radio buttons, select the option that describes the characteristics of the workload of the VDC: ESSENTIAL. For lower priority workloads, such as temporary applications, data processing or system modelling tasks. VMs in the VDC can have contended compute resource allocation (CPU/RAM) and automated rebalancing is enabled to ensure the workload receives the requested performance. POWER. For key workloads that are resource intensive, such as web and application workloads, mid-sized databases and caching services. VMs in the VDC have an uncontended compute resource allocation and automated rebalancing is enabled to pre-emptively optimise performance and availability. PRIORITY. For critical workloads that handle important business processes that benefit from a steady state of operation. VMs in the VDC have an uncontended compute resource allocation and automated rebalancing is configured to reduce workload movement around the platform. Enter a VDC Name . Tip The name can be up to 32 characters long and can include any character except + , ( or ) . Click Build . The VDC Build Status page displays information about the VDC you're building and lets you know how the build is progressing. Tip You can stay on this page until the build is finished, or you can leave this page and check the status of the build later by going to the VMware Cloud Build History report. When the build is complete, the page displays either a success or fail message. If the build is successful, you can start building VMs. To provide external access to the VDC, you'll need to create an edge gateway (see How to build an edge gateway using the UKCloud Portal ). If the build is unsuccessful, raise a support ticket (quoting the Build ID ) to resolve any issues. Logging in to VMware Cloud Director After you've created your compute service and VDC, you can start to build up your applications. To do this, you must log in to VMware Cloud Director, which you can access from the UKCloud Portal. In the Portal navigation panel expand VMware Cloud then select your compute service. On the VMware Cloud Director tab, for additional security, re-enter your UKCloud Portal password, then click Confirm . VMware Cloud Director launches in your browser window. The tasks you can perform in VMware Cloud Director will depend on the permissions you have been granted. For more information, see How to manage permissions for VMware Cloud Director . To return to the UKCloud Portal, click your user name in the top right corner, and select Log out . Next steps In this Getting Started Guide , you've learned: About your UKCloud for VMware environment and how your estate is organised How to log in to the UKCloud Portal How to create a compute service and VDC to set up your environment How to log in to VMware Cloud Director so that you can start to build your applications Now that you've set up your basic environment, you can start building your applications. If you want to get up and running quickly, you can take a look at How to build a virtual machine with UKCloud for VMware , which provides a walkthrough of the process.

    "title": "How to build a virtual machine with UKCloud for VMware (vCloud Director 9.7)",
    "keywords": "How to build a virtual machine with UKCloud for VMware (vCloud Director 9.7) Overview This guide leads you through the three basic steps for using UKCloud for VMware to quickly build a simple virtual machine (VM) in vCloud Director 9.7, and connect it to the internet. For more information about how to use other vCloud Director functions to make the most of UKCloud for VMware and create more complex virtual data centres (VDCs), take a look at the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware . The three steps covered in this guide are: Create a network (to move requests around your VMs) Configure the edge gateway (in this guide we focus on the firewall and NAT configuration) Create a virtual machine If you follow these steps, you can have a VM up and running with a connection to the internet in about 20 to 25 minutes. Before you begin You should have received your UKCloud Portal login credentials from your Portal administrator. You should have created a compute service and VDC within your account. For more information, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware . You should also have created an edge gateway, which enables communication between your VDC and the outside world. For more information, see How to build an edge gateway using the UKCloud Portal . Create a network Before you can start building VMs in your VDC, you need to create the network that connects the VMs to each other and the outside world. First, you need to create a network that can connect to external networks outside your VDC (including the internet). This is called an external routed network . You can find more information about routed networks in How to create a routed VDC network . Log in to the UKCloud Portal. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal Select your account. In the Portal navigation panel, expand VMware Cloud and then select the compute service in which you want to create your VM. Tip If you haven't created a compute service yet, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware . On the vCloud Director tab, enter your Portal password and click Confirm . In the vCloud Director Virtual Datacenters dashboard, select your VDC. Tip If you haven't created a VDC yet, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware . You're creating a network, so, in the left navigation panel, select Networks . To create a new network, click the Add button. You want your VM to connect to the internet (rather than just other VMs in the same VDC), so in the Network Type page of the New Organization VDC Network dialog box, select Routed . Click Next . In the General page, give the network a Name and Description . In the Gateway CIDR field, enter the details for the gateway address. You can make your network available to other VDCs within the same region so that VMs can communicate with each other, regardless of which VDC they are in. For example, you may have a single repository server that provides updates for all the VMs in a region. For the purposes of this exercise, leave the Shared option deselected. Click Next . When you connect a network to the outside world, it's important that you control exactly what can access your environment via that network. UKCloud for VMware uses edge gateways to do this. In the Edge Connection page, select the edge that you want your new network to use (we'll work more with the edge gateway later on). Tip If you haven't created an edge gateway, see How to build an edge gateway using the UKCloud Portal . Click Next . A VM needs an IP address to identify it on the network. In the Static IP Pools page, identify the range of IP addresses that VMs connecting to this network can use then click Add . For example, if your Gateway CIDR is 192.168.1.1/24 , you can use the 192.168.1.10-192.168.1.100 range for your static IP pool, giving 91 usable internal IP addresses. Click Next . In the DNS page, enter your DNS information. Click Next . In the Ready to Complete page, review your selections then click Finish . Configure the edge gateway The edge gateway is possibly the most complex part of the VDC because of its high level of functionality. The following steps show you how to quickly configure the edge gateway to enable you to access the internet from a VM. Important NAT rules only work if the firewall is enabled. For security reasons, you should ensure that the firewall is always enabled. In the vCloud Director Virtual Datacenters dashboard, select your VDC. This time you're working with the edge gateway, so in the left navigation panel, click Edges . Select the edge gateway you want to work with and click the Configure Services button. Each tab in the Edge Gateway dialog box provides access to a different service provided by the edge gateway. The main tabs are: Firewall - As well as a physical firewall, you can control which networks and ports can communicate through the edge gateway. You'll set up some firewall rules later in this exercise. DHCP - The edge gateway can act as a DHCP server for VMs connected to Org networks connected to an edge. The DHCP tab shows DHCP information for any VDC networks that have been configured with DHCP, and so acts as a centralised view. For more information, see How to create a DHCP pool . NAT - Network address translation, both in (DNAT) and out (SNAT) of the edge gateway. You'll set up some NAT rules later in this exercise. Routing - You can provide static routes from the edge gateway to other networks, for example networks in other VDCs in your compute service. For more information, see How to create a static route . Load Balancer - The edge gateway provides simple HTTP and HTTPS load balancing using round robin. For more information, see How to configure a load balancer . VPN - IPsec site‑to‑site VPN is available on the edge gateway. You can configure an IPsec VPN within vCloud Director, but you may need to perform additional configuration through the API. For more information, see How to configure IPsec VPN . To access the internet from a VM, you'll need to create firewall rules to determine who can access your network and NAT rules to route traffic within your network. Creating firewall rules Let's start with firewall rules: In the Edge Gateway dialog box, select the Firewall tab. Make sure the Enabled option is selected. Click the + button to add a new row to the firewall rules table. Edit the values in the row for the New Rule using the settings below: Name - HTTPS outbound Source - internal Click + (Add object) button, select Internal , click the right arrow button, then click Keep . Destination - external Click + (Add object) button, select External , click the right arrow button, then click Keep . Service - Click the + button and enter the following values in the Add Service dialog box Protocol - TCP Source Port - any Destination Port - 443 Click Keep when you're done. Action - Accept These settings allow traffic from the VMs ( Source = internal ) to reach destinations outside your VDC ( Destination = external ) on port 443 (HTTPS). You'll need to repeat these steps for ports 80 (HTTP) and 53 (DNS). Note For DNS, the protocol should be UDP. You can also allow traffic to reach your VMs from outside your VDC by swapping the Source and Destination values. However, because this opens up your firewall to a lot of traffic, we recommend that you first complete this guide to get comfortable with general networking concepts, and then take a look at the information in How to create firewall rules where you can find out how to lock the firewall down. Click Save changes . Creating NAT rules Now that you've set up the firewall rules, you can create NAT rules: In the Edge Gateways dialog box, select the NAT tab. In the NAT44 Rules section, click the SNAT Rule button to create a source NAT (SNAT) rule to translate internal IP addresses into something that the external network can understand. In the Add SNAT Rule dialog box, from the Applied on list, choose the edge gateway to which you want to apply the SNAT rule. In the Original Source IP/Range field, enter the range of addresses you created when you created the network in the previous exercise. In the Translated Source IP/Range field, enter one or more of the external IP addresses provided to you by UKCloud. If you are not sure what your IP addresses are, see How to find your allocated external IP addresses . When you're done, click Keep and then Save changes . You can also add destination NAT (DNAT) rules to translate external IP addresses to route traffic to the appropriate internal addresses. However, because the firewall only provides outbound access to the internet, we don't need to add DNAT rules at the moment. You can find more information about setting up NAT rules in How to create NAT rules . Create a virtual machine Now that you've laid the groundwork, it's time to create your VM. The best way to do this is to create a virtual application (vApp). You can think of a vApp as a container for your VMs; it enables you to group related VMs together to manage them in one place. See How to create a vApp to find out more. In the vCloud Director Virtual Datacenters dashboard, select your VDC. In the left navigation panel, click vApps . In this exercise, you'll create the vApp from scratch, so click New vApp . In the New vApp dialog box, give the vApp a Name and Description . Click Add Virtual Machine . In the New VM dialog box, you can create your VM. Enter a Name , Computer Name and Description for the VM. Tip The Name is to identify the VM, the Computer Name is the host name of the VM. The Computer Name is copied from the Name field but can contain only alphanumeric characters and hyphens so you may need to edit it if your VM Name contains spaces or special characters. The easiest way to create a VM is to use a pre-built template from a catalog, so from the Type radio buttons, select From Template . From the list of Templates , select the one you want to use. Click * OK . Important By default, the Power on check box is selected for new VMs. If you do not want the VM to power on and start incurring charges immediately, make sure to deselect this check box. Back in the New vApp dialog box, you can add more VMs if you want, but for now click Create to create the vApp and the single VM. There are some more configuration tasks to complete for your new VM, so in the left navigation panel, select Virtual Machines to list all the VMs in the VDC. In the card for your new VM, click Details . In the General section, you can change the VM name in the Name field, but keep the default Storage Policy option. Expand the Hardware section and, in the NICs section, click Add and select the externally routed Network you created in the first exercise. From the IP Mode list, choose Static - IP Pool to use the IP pool you defined earlier when you created your network. You don't need to change anything in the other sections, so click Save . If your VM is not already powered on, in the card for the VM, select Actions then Power On . Click the monitor icon to open the popout console and go through the setup procedure. To confirm that you have connectivity to the internet and have an assigned IP address: Type ipconfig into the Command Prompt. If you've configured the networking correctly, your VM will return an IP address. Open an internet browser page and navigate to an external web page Ping the IP address of your DNS (for example, 8.8.8.8 ) through the command line. Next steps In this guide, you've learned how to build a simple virtual machine and connect it to the internet.

    "title": "Getting Started Guide for Journaling Protection",
    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for Journaling Protection Overview Journaling Protection is a powerful, self-service replication and recovery tool that can help you improve your organisational resilience. By adopting UKCloud's Journaling Protection solution, you can protect your UKCloud for VMware applications by replicating them to another UKCloud for VMware‑enabled zone. This ensures that you can meet your disaster recovery requirements --- including any aggressive recovery point or recovery time objectives. Our Journaling Protection solution is powered by Zerto, a leading provider of disaster recovery software for the cloud. This guide covers the tasks you need to perform to get Journaling Protection up and running in your environment. Intended audience This guide is intended for any user who needs to create and manage Journaling Protection for UKCloud for VMware. To complete the steps in this guide you need to have access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal. Introduction to Journaling Protection You can protect your VMs by adding Journaling Protection to the vApp that contains those VMs. When you add Journaling Protection to a vApp, if a VM in that vApp is compromised, for example by a virus attack or bad software update, you can quickly recover the VM to a point in time before that attack or update took place. You enable Journaling Protection by adding the vApp to a virtual protection group (VPG). Each VM in the protected vApp is synchronised to the recovery site and a journal is created. After this initial synchronisation, each subsequent write operation to the VM is processed as normal on the source site and a copy is asynchronously sent to the recovery site and written to the journal. Each journal entry exists in the journal for a specified number of days (the journal history). When the journal history is reached, as new journal entries are created, older entries are written to the recovery VM's virtual disks. Every few seconds, a checkpoint is written to every journal for each VM in the VPG to ensure crash-consistency between the VMs. If you need to recover a VM, you select a checkpoint to recover to. For example, in the case of a virus, you could recover to a checkpoint from before the attack. During recovery, the vApp and its VMs are created on the recovery site and the recovery disks for each VM are attached to the recovered VM. Information in the journal is then promoted to the VM to bring it up to the date and time of the selected checkpoint. Two terms you may hear in connection with Journaling Protection are recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO). The RPO indicates the amount of data you can afford to lose in the event of an outage. For example, if your application data changes fairly infrequently, your RPO can be higher as the data remains fairly static. However, if your application data is constantly changing, you'll need your RPO to be smaller to avoid significant loss of data in the event of an outage. The RTO is the amount of time you can tolerate your application being unavailable in the event of an outage. For example, if your application provides critical functionality, you'll need to bring it back online very quickly. However, for a less critical application, you may be able to tolerate a longer outage. Because of the use of regular checkpoints (every few seconds), our Zerto‑powered Journaling Protection option provides a minimal RPO. The ability to use recovered VMs even before all the journal data has been promoted provides a good RTO as well. Before you begin When you request Journaling Protection for your VMs, UKCloud provides you with: A ZORG ID to identify your environment within Zerto Access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal (ZSSP), where you can create and manage your VPGs You should consider the following: Journaling Protection is provided on a vApp basis (not for individual VMs). When designing your application, you should use vApps to group related VMs together to ensure crash consistency between VMs in the event of a failover. VMs must be powered on to be synchronised. The operating system used by the protected VMs must also be supported in the recovery site. Our Journaling Protection service option captures every action. When a VM is deleted from your vApp, the associated journal is also deleted. If you want to keep historic records of VMs that are no longer running on the platform, consider UKCloud's Snapshot Protection service option. We provide service profiles for 2, 7, 14 and 28 day retention. The details of these are available in the Journaling Protection Service Scope . We do not currently provide the option for you to create custom profiles. Getting Journaling Protection up and running To get Journaling Protection up and running for your VMs, follow the steps below: Create a recovery VDC Configure networking on the recovery site Create a virtual protection group Perform a test failover Create a recovery VDC To recover your VMs to a different UKCloud site, you must have a VDC in the intended recovery site. If you already have a compute service in the recovery site, you can use an existing VDC or you can create a new one using: The UKCloud Portal (for more information see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware ) The UKCloud Portal API (for more information see the How to use the UKCloud Portal API ) If you don't already have a compute service in the recovery site or you'd prefer UKCloud to create the VDC for you, you can request this as part of your Journaling Protection Service Request. Configure networking on the recovery site You must configure any internally and externally routed networks in your recovery site to duplicate those in the source site. You must also configure the edge gateway with the same firewall, NAT and other rules. You'll create the mapping between these networks when you create your VPG (see How to create a virtual protection group ). In the event of a failover, external access to the recovery site will be via a different IP address. You'll need to account for any required DNS changes and external connectivity configuration (such as VPNs), to ensure continued external access. Utilising UKCloud's VMware cloud, you can configure this in advance. Alternatively, you can use load balancing technologies to manage a seamless switch between environments. You do not need to configure vApp networks in advance as they will be replicated within the VPG. Create a virtual protection group A virtual protection group (VPG) is a collection of VMs that are grouped together for protection purposes. The UKCloud Journaling Protection service option protects VMs on a vApp basis. When you create a VPG, you specify the vApp to protect and all the VMs in that vApp are protected. For example, in a standard three-tier application, you will likely have three VMs: one for your application, one for the database and one for the web server. As best practice, you should create these three related VMs in a single vApp, which you can then add to a VPG so that all the VMs are replicated (and recovered) together. For more information, see How to create a virtual protection group . Perform a test failover After you create your VPG, we recommend that you perform a test failover to confirm that your VMs will be recovered correctly in the event of a live failover. You should also run test failovers periodically to ensure that your VMs can still be recovered successfully. For more information, see How to perform a failover . Next steps You have now performed all the steps needed to set up Journaling Protection for your VMs. If you experience a disaster, such as a virus attack, you can perform a live failover to recover your VMs to a specific point in time before the disaster occurred and continue operation as usual. For more information, see How to perform a failover . Glossary This glossary provides definitions of terms specific to Journaling Protection. failover When an application switches to an alternative environment in order to ensure continued operation. journal A repository of write operations performed on a protected VM after the initial synchronisation. source site The UKCloud site where your live VMs are located. recovery point objective (RPO) The amount of data you can afford to lose in the event of an outage. recovery site The UKCloud site to which your VMs are replicated for protection.

    "title": "How to access syslog data for your edge gateway",
    "keywords": "How to access syslog data for your edge gateway Overview Your NSX edge is globally configured to send syslog messages to a specific IP address ( 100.127.255.250 ). By configuring a new network or IP address within your virtual data centre (VDC) and deploying a collector with the syslog IP address, you can access your NSX edge syslog data. You can then use this data to check: Allowed and denied network traffic Load balancer statistics Load balancer health This guide explains the network configuration required to provision a syslog collector within your VDC to receive syslog information direct from your NSX gateway. Collecting syslog data for a single NSX edge The simplest scenario is to gather syslog data from a single NSX edge into one collector. To do this you need to create a routable location for the syslog IP address, by either: Adding the syslog IP address to an existing network interface card (NIC) on a routed subnet Configuring a new routed network Adding the syslog IP address to an existing NIC Add the syslog IP address to a subnet on the routed network. For example, if your existing monitoring server has a NIC on eth0 (for example, 10.0.1.10 ), on routed VDC network 10.0.1.0/24 , you'd add the syslog IP address to eth0 . Add a route on the NSX edge that routes the syslog IP address via the subnet. For example, route 100.127.255.250 MASK 255.255.255.255 via 10.0.1.10 . Configure the software on your existing monitoring server to capture data from the IP address of the NSX edge. Note The steps to achieve this depend on your operating system and chosen syslog server. Configuring a new routed network Create a new routed network with the following details: Name: Customer defined Gateway: 100.127.255.249/29 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.248 DNS: Customer defined Static IP Pool: 100.127.255.250-100.127.255.254 You can find more detailed steps for creating a routed network in How to create a routed VDC network . Deploy a new syslog server connected to the new routed network with a static address of 100.127.255.250 and install and configure the syslog server's NSX edge. Note The steps to achieve this depend on your operating system and chosen syslog server. Collecting syslog data for multiple NSX edges If you have multiple NSX edges under a single NFT, you can gather the data from all those edges into the same syslog collector. Set up a single syslog collector for one of your NSX edges as described in the previous section. Note We'll refer to this NSX edge as the syslog edge and all the other NSX edges as source edges . Confirm that you can see the local syslog traffic from the local syslog edge. Create a firewall rule on the syslog edge to allow syslog traffic from the source edges' TRANSIT IPs ( 172.26. x . x in Assured or 172.26. LOWER OCTET . x in Elevated) through to the syslog server IP. You can create individual rules using the following suggestions: SOURCE TRANSIT IP :Any to 100.127.255.250 on UDP Any:Any to 100.127.255.250:514 on UDP NFT TRANSIT CIDR/SUBNET :Any to 100.127.255.250:514 on UDP On each of the source edges, create a static route to direct traffic to the syslog edge. Use the following settings: Network: 100.127.255.248/29 Next Hop IP: The TRANSIT IP address of the syslog edge Syslog packets from each source edge will now be forwarded to the syslog edge, with the source of the syslog traffic being the TRANSIT IP of the source edge. Perform a packet capture on the syslog collector to confirm it's receiving packets from the source edges. Note You may have to enable or disable logging on firewall rules to trigger syslog traffic. When you've confirmed that your syslog collector is receiving the syslog data, configure your syslog server to capture packets from the new syslog source. Enabling logging After setting up your syslog collector, you need to make sure that your NSX edge sends network traffic to the log. In VMware Cloud Director, select the VDC to which the NSX edge belongs. In the left navigation panel, under Networking , select Edges . Select the edge that you want to configure and click Services . Select the Edge Settings tab. Click Edit Syslog Server . In the Edit Syslog Server dialog box, in the Syslog Server field, enter the IP address of your syslog server then click Keep . Select the Firewall Rules tab. For each firewall rule that you want to log, select the Enable logging check box, then click Save changes . Select the NAT tab. For each NAT rule that you want to log, select the rule, click the Edit icon, select the Enable logging option then click Keep . When you're done, click Save changes . Select the Load Balancer tab. On the Global Configuration tab, select the Enable Logging option. From the Log Level list, select the logging level. You can find more detailed steps for editing load balancer settings in How to configure a load balancer . When you're done, click Save changes .

    "keywords": "How to access VMware Cloud Director through the Cloud Director API Overview To perform some tasks within your UKCloud for VMware environment, you may need to access VMware Cloud Director through the Cloud Director API. This guide shows you how to access the Cloud Director API. Before you begin Before using the Cloud Director API, we recommend that you install a REST client that enables you to access the API using a more intuitive interface. The steps in this article use a plugin called YARC; if you use a different client, some of the steps will be different. Finding your Cloud Director API credentials Before using the Cloud Director API, you first need to find your API credentials. Log in to the UKCloud Portal . Select your account. In the top right corner of the page, click your username and then select API . The API page provides a view of your personal credentials for accessing the Cloud Director API. In particular, the page provides the following information for each compute service: API URL - Use this URL at the beginning of your calls to the Cloud Director API. Note This URL will be different depending on the region in which your compute service is located. API Username - The user ID to use to authenticate yourself with the Cloud Director API. Note The compute service ID is added to the end of the username. This is because you may have access to multiple compute services. Username - The API username without the appended compute service ID. Org ID - Use this to uniquely identify the compute service (or vOrg) when using the Cloud Director API. Password - For authentication with the Cloud Director API. This password is the same as the one you use to log in to the UKCloud Portal. Make a note of the Org ID , the API URL and your API Username . Obtaining an authorisation token To start interacting with the Cloud Director API, you first need to obtain an x-vmware-vcloud-access-token token; to do this you need to adjust some settings in your chosen REST client. The steps below provide an example of how to do this in YARC. Open your REST client. Create a POST request to obtain the token using the API URL you recorded earlier, adding the following to the end of the URL: /api/sessions a. To do this in YARC, from the list of methods, select POST . b. In the URL field, enter the API URL followed by /api/sessions . Add a Basic Authentication header. a. To do this in YARC, expand the Authentication section and click Add Credentials . b. In the Basic Authorization dialog box, in the Username field, enter your API username recorded earlier from the Portal API page. c. In the Password field, enter your UKCloud Portal password and then click Save . Add an Accept header. a. To do this in YARC, expand the Custom Headers section and click Add New Header . b. In the Header dialog box, in the Name field, enter Accept . c. In the Value field enter application/*+xml;version=34.0 . d. The table in the Headers section now displays the Accept header. Your REST client has now got all the required settings in place to make a request to the Cloud Director API to obtain a x-vmware-vcloud-access-token token, so send the request. If the request is successful, in the response, you'll see an x-vmware-vcloud-access-token token. In YARC you can find this in the Response section on the Response Headers tab. The x-vmware-vcloud-access-token token becomes part of an Authorization header, which replaces the Basic Authentication header added earlier. In the response, highlight and copy the string of characters displayed after the word x-vmware-vcloud-access-token . Note If at any point while following the instructions in this article, the output displayed in the REST client does not look similar to that shown in the images, you can use the value of the returned HTTP response code to determine what went wrong and needs investigation. For a list of HTTP response codes, see HTTP Response Codes . Add an Authorization header. a. To do this in YARC, in the Headers section, select Add New Header . b. In the Header dialog box, in the Name field enter Authorization . c. In the Value field, enter Bearer (with a trailing space), paste the string of characters copied in the previous step, then click Save . Now that you've obtained an x-vmware-vcloud-access-token token, you can remove the Basic Authentication that you added in step 3.

    "keywords": "How to build an edge gateway using the UKCloud Portal Overview To enable your end users to access your VDC, you need to create an edge gateway to provide connectivity. The UKCloud Portal provides the ability to build an edge gateway, without having to raise a service request. You can also create edge gateways using the Portal API. For more information, see the UKCloud Portal API User Guide . Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide, you must be a VMware Cloud Director administrator. Building an edge gateway If your VDC is located on the Assured OFFICIAL security domain, its edge gateway provides access to the internet. If your VDC is located on the Elevated OFFICIAL security domain, its edge gateway provides access to your other VDCs in the Elevated OFFICIAL domain. Note You can build edge gateways in any of your compute services in regions 5 or 6, not just those you created using the Portal. For information about building compute services and VDCs, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware . Log in to the UKCloud Portal. For more detailed steps, see the Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal . In the Portal navigation panel, expand VMware Cloud and then select the compute service in which you want to create the edge gateway. From the Actions menu, select Build Edge Gateway . Note If this option is greyed out, either you do not have the appropriate permissions or your compute service is not in region 5 or 6. On the Build Edge Gateway page, from the Associated VDC list, select the VDC for which you are creating the edge gateway. The VDC names in the list include information about the security domain in which the VDC is located and the VM type of the VDC. Note The list of VDCs includes all VDCs in the compute service, whether or not they already have an edge gateway. If you select a VDC that already has an edge gateway of the same type, you will get an error. Click Build . The Edge Gateway Build Status page displays information about the edge gateway you're building and lets you know how the build is progressing. Tip You can stay on this page until the build is finished, or you can leave this page and check the status of the build later by expanding Reports in the Portal navigation panel and selecting VMware Cloud Build History . When the build is complete, the page displays either a success or fail message. If the build is successful, you can now start configuring the edge gateway. For a quick guide on how to do this, see How to build a virtual machine with UKCloud for VMware . If the build is unsuccessful, raise a support ticket (quoting the Build ID ) to resolve any issues.

    "keywords": "How to change IPsec VPN settings via the Cloud Director API Overview This guide shows you how to retrieve, modify, and submit blocks of XML that represent the configuration of the IPsec VPN tunnels. The guide covers modifications to the local and peer IP addresses, local and peer IDs as well the addition or removal of local and peer subnets. In addition to this, the guide also outlines the steps required to modify the shared secret key used on a given IPsec VPN tunnel. Use cases: Enabling customers to quickly amend IPsec configurations Modifications of this nature are not possible in the VMware Cloud Director graphical user interface without first deleting the existing IPsec VPN configuration entirely and re-entering the settings. Depending on the number of tunnels, this can be a lengthy task. Making changes to the IPsec VPN configuration via the Cloud Director API can greatly speed up this process. Edge gateway configuration data You can also use the steps in this guide to obtain a backup of the current configuration applied to an edge gateway. You can then use this to restore the configuration of the edge gateway at a later point in time. By following the instructions in this guide you can make amendments to the IPsec VPN configuration without first needing to engage with UKCloud Support. Before you begin Before using the Cloud Director API to view and update IPsec VPN settings, we recommend that you install a REST client that enables you to access the API. The steps in this article use a Firefox plugin called RESTClient, but you can use your preferred client. You also need to find your API credentials. For more information, see How to access VMware Cloud Director through the Cloud Director API Obtaining an authorisation token To start interacting with the Cloud Director API, you first need to obtain an x-vcloud-authorization token; to do this you need to adjust some settings in RESTClient. In your browser, click the RESTClient icon. From the Method menu, select POST . In the API field, enter the API URL you recorded earlier and append the following to the end of the URL: /api/sessions Next add a Basic Authentication header. To do this, from the Authentication menu at the top of the REST Client, select Basic Authentication . In the Basic Authentication dialog box, in the Username field, enter your API username recorded earlier from the API page. In the Password field enter your UKCloud Portal password and then click Okay . The Request section now includes an Authorization header. Next add an Accept header. To do this, from the Headers menu, select Custom Header . In the Request Header dialog box, in the Name field, enter Accept In the Value field enter application/*+xml;version=34.0 and then click Okay . The Headers section should now be displayed, containing the Accept header. The RESTClient has now got all the required settings in place to make a request to the Cloud Director API to obtain a x-vcloud-authorization token, so click the Send button. When a response is received the Headers tab in the Response section will be populated, including an x-vcloud-authorization token. The x-vcloud-authorization token will replace the Basic Authentication header added earlier. To do this highlight and copy the string of characters displayed after the word x-vcloud-authorization . Note If at any point while following the instructions in this guide, the output displayed in the REST Client does not look similar to that shown in the images, you can use the value of the Status Code field to determine what went wrong and needs investigation. In this case above, Status Code received was HTTP 200 OK, which means that the request succeeded. For a list of HTTP response codes, see HTTP Response Codes . To add an x-vcloud-authorization header, from the Headers menu, select Custom Header . In the Request Header dialog box, in the Name field enter x-vcloud-authorization . In the Value field, paste the string of characters copied in the previous step, then click Okay . Now that you've obtained an x-vcloud-authorization token, you can remove the Basic Authentication Header. Click the x in the upper right-hand corner of the header. Retrieving organisation details via the API Now that you've obtained an x-vcloud-authorization token, you can call the Cloud Director API to retrieve the information that you need about your organisation to set up your IPsec VPN. Set the Method to GET . In the Response section, select the Preview tab. This view lists the links that you can use to drill down into the various objects exposed via the Cloud Director API. Of interest in the output below is a link that will, when queried, return details about the organisation and the objects contained within it. The link should look something like: https://<api_url>/api/org/<org_id> Copy the URL and paste it into the Request URL field. Click Send . After a short amount of time the contents of the Response Preview tab will be updated to reflect the response from the Cloud Director API to your latest request, including links to each VDC in the organisation. Retrieving virtual data centre details via the API To retrieve details about the VDCs in an organisation: Copy the link for the VDC containing the target edge gateway for your IPsec VPN. The link should look something like: https://<api_url>/api/vdc/<vdc_id> Click Send . The contents of the Response Preview tab will be updated again. Retrieving edge gateway configuration via the API To retrieve details of the edge gateway configuration: The response this time will probably be quite long. To easily locate a specific section in the response, use your browser's search utility. You can invoke this in Firefox by pressing CTRL+F . In the search dialog window at the bottom of the screen enter edgeGateways , and then click the down arrow button to locate a section that looks similar to the one shown below: <Link rel=\"edgeGateways\" href=\"https://api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/admin/vdc/<vdc_id>/edgeGateways\" type=\"application/vnd.vmware.vcloud.query.records+xml\" /> Copy the link ending in /edgeGateways and paste it into the URL field at the top of the RESTClient. Ensure that the Method drop down is set to GET and click Send . If this request is successful, the response will contain a link to the edge gateway which, when queried, will return the configuration of the edge gateway. Once you have received a response, use your browser's search utility to locate the EdgeGatewayRecord section within the response. <EdgeGatewayRecord gatewayStatus=\"READY\" haStatus=\"UP\" isBusy=\"false\" name=\"UKCloud Gateway (nft00002i2)\" numberOfExtNetworks=\"1\" numberOfOrgNetworks=\"8\" vdc=\"https://api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/vdc/<vdc_id>\" href=\"https://api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/admin/edgeGateway/<edge_id>\" task=\"https://api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/task/<task_id>\" isSyslogServerSettingInSync=\"true\" taskOperation=\"networkConfigureEdgeGatewayServices\" taskStatus=\"success\" taskDetails=\" \" /> Within the EdgeGatewayRecord section of the above from the response, locate the link to the edge gateway that starts with the following: https://<api_url>/api/admin/edgeGateway/ Appended to the end of the URL will be a unique identifier for the edge gateway within the VDC. Copy this link, paste it into the URL field and then click Send . After a short amount of time the current configuration of the edge gateway will be displayed in a block of XML. Reviewing the edge gateway configuration The edge configuration information is contained between an opening <Configuration> and closing </Configuration> tag. This block of XML is split into sections which detail the configuration settings applied to a specific item, function or service available on the edge gateway. There are twelve sections in total; however only the configuration settings contained under the <GatewayIpsecVpnService> tags will be discussed in this guide. The example below shows a high‑level overview of the structure of the XML block returned, including the <GatewayIpsecVpnServices> tags. <EdgeGateway> <Configuration> <GatewayBackingConfig> </GatewayBackingConfig> <GatewayInterfaces> </GatewayInterfaces> <EdgeGatewayServiceConfiguration> <FirewallService> </FirewallService> <NatService> </NatService> <GatewayIpsecVpnService> </GatewayIpsecVpnService> <StaticRoutingService> </StaticRoutingService> <LoadBalancerService> </LoadBalancerService> </EdgeGatewayServiceConfiguration> <HaEnabled> </HaEnabled> <UseDefaultRouteForDnsRelay> </UseDefaultRouteForDnsRelay> </Configuration> </EdgeGateway\\> Before making any changes to the edge gateway via the API it is highly recommended to keep a copy of the XML returned. You can then use this backup to restore the configuration of the edge gateway to a known working configuration if the need arises. To copy the XML: Select the Response Preview tab of the RESTClient. Scroll down to the opening <Configuration> tag and highlight everything up to and including the closing <\\Configuration> tag. The length of the XML to copy is dependent on the number of NAT, firewall rules and another configuration applied to the edge gateway. With the contents of the <Configuration> tags highlighted, right click and select Copy . Paste the configuration into a text editor, saving the file to a known location on your computer. Using a text editor that offers syntax highlighting such as Notepad++ will simplify the editing process. Locating the IPsec VPN settings in the returned XML To locate the IPsec VPN settings, open a new text editor window and copy and paste the contents between the opening <GatewayIpsecVpnService> and closing </GatewayIpsecVpnService> tags. The contents should look similar to the XML block shown below: <GatewayIpsecVpnService> <IsEnabled>true</IsEnabled> <Endpoint> <Network type=\"application/vnd.vmware.admin.network+xml\" href=\"https://api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/admin/network/3c284ec8-2850- ba77-098c-7f697a3d8769\"/> <PublicIp>37.26.88.73</PublicIp> </Endpoint> <Tunnel> <Name>UKCloud IPSEC VPN Demo</Name> <Description/> <IpsecVpnThirdPartyPeer> <PeerId>134.170.188.221</PeerId> </IpsecVpnThirdPartyPeer> <PeerIpAddress>134.170.188.221</PeerIpAddress> <PeerId>134.170.188.221</PeerId> <LocalIpAddress>172.26.45.97</LocalIpAddress> <LocalId>172.26.45.97</LocalId> <LocalSubnet> <Name>VPN Test Network 1</Name> <Gateway>192.168.1.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </LocalSubnet> <PeerSubnet> <Name>192.168.2.0/24</Name> <Gateway>192.168.2.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </PeerSubnet> <SharedSecret>UKCloudIPSECVPNDemoSharedSecretKey</SharedSecret> <SharedSecretEncrypted>false</SharedSecretEncrypted> <EncryptionProtocol>AES256</EncryptionProtocol> <Mtu>1500</Mtu> <IsEnabled>true</IsEnabled> <IsOperational>true</IsOperational> </Tunnel> </GatewayIpsecVpnService> Modifying the IPsec VPN configuration This section outlines common tasks performed via the API to manipulate the IPsec VPN configuration applied to a given edge gateway. Modifying the local endpoint IP and local ID You can change the local IP and local ID by editing the contents between the opening <localIpAddress> and closing </localIpAddress> and <localId> and </localId> tags. This is by far the most commonly performed modification to the IPsec VPN configuration via the Cloud Director API. You can use this to change the local IP address from the IP address assigned to the edge gateway on the transit network to the IP address assigned to the edge gateways on the public network. For the tunnel to come up successfully, the local IP address must be set to the edge gateway's public IP address. The local ID must also match the public IP address specified. Modifying the peer endpoint IP and peer ID If you need to move the remote endpoint of the tunnel to a new device or IP address, then you can adjust the <PeerIpAddress> and <PeerId> tags. When changing the peer IP address of the tunnel you must ensure that the peer ID is also updated to match the new peer IP address. Adding or removing local subnets You can add additional local subnets to the IPsec VPN tunnel. This involves adding a new <LocalSubnet> definition to the IPsec VPN config. Adding or removing peer subnets You can use the same process to add or remove a <PeerSubnet> . Amending the shared secret If you need to update or amend the shared secret on an IPsec VPN, edit the value between the opening <SharedSecret> and closing </SharedSecret> tags. Note The shared secret must be at least 32 characters in length. To enhance the security of the tunnel, we highly recommend that you avoid using dictionary words in the shared secret key. Applying the new configuration When you've updated the relevant sections of the configuration, you can apply it to the edge gateway. Enclose the new configuration in a pair of <EdgeGatewayServiceConfiguration> tags. Copy and paste this configuration into the Request Body section of the RESTClient. From the Method list, select POST . Append the following to the URL in the URL field: /action/configureServices For example, if the original contents of the URL were: https://<api_url>/api/admin/edgeGateway/<id> The updated URL would be: https://<api_url>/api/admin/edgeGateway/<id>/action/configureServices You must also add one more Header to the RESTClient prior to submitting the new configuration. From the Headers menu at the top of the REST Client select Custom Header . In the Name field, enter Content-Type . In the Attribute Value field enter the following: application/vnd.vmware.admin.edgeGatewayServiceConfiguration+xml Click Okay . To submit the new configuration, click Send . The status of the edge gateway as viewed from VMware Cloud Director will briefly show as Updating Configuration . Once this process has completed, right click the edge gateway and select Configure Services . In the Configure Services window select the VPN tab. You should see the new configuration settings. Verify the status of the IPsec VPN tunnel on your remote device to ensure that the tunnel has been established successfully.

    "title": "How to configure a Distributed Firewall",
    "keywords": "How to configure a Distributed Firewall Overview UKCloud for VMware provides Distributed Firewall (DFW) functionality as part of its Advanced Management bundle (additional charges apply). DFW enables microsegmentation of networks at the virtual data centre (VDC) level. It can inspect every packet and frame coming to and leaving the VM regardless of the network topology. Packet inspection is done at the VM virtual NIC (vNIC) level, which enables access-control lists (ACLs) to be applied closest to the source. You can have a routed or isolated network on a vApp and still use a DFW at the VDC level to complement it. The NSX edge handles North-South bound traffic while the DFW is designed to manage East-West bound traffic. The DFW rules can be based on Layer 2 (L2) up to Layer 4 (L4). Layer 2 (L2) rules (Ethernet tab) are based on MAC address L2 protocols like ARP, RARP and LLDP Layer 3 (L3) rules (General tab) are based on Ip source destination Layer 4 (L4) uses a TCP or UDP service port L2 (Ethernet) firewall rules are processed before L3 rules. The default firewall rule allows L2 and L3 traffic to pass through your VDCs. Once you've implemented all the rules, you can change this to block. Rules are always read and enforced from top-to-bottom ordering like any traditional firewall. DFW rules can have one or more of the following entities as the source or destination: Org VDC networks, virtual machines, Org VDCs, MAC sets (L2 – Ethernet), IP sets (L3 – General) or security groups. Note Running open VMare tools on VMs has not been validated with DFW. Configuring a Distributed Firewall To access the DFW: In the VMware Cloud Director Virtual Data Center dashboard, select the VDC that contains the DFW you want to manage. In the left navigation panel, under Networking , select Security . Select the Security Services for your VDC, then click Configure Services . Even though other VDC security policies are listed in this section, you cannot launch the configuration until you switch to the relevant VDC. You can confirm which VDC you are in by looking at the Data center name displayed at the top of the page. To go back to all VDCs, click All Virtual data centers . In the Distributed Firewall > General tab of the Services dialog box, select Enable Distributed Firewall . This creates default rules in both the General (L3) and Ethernet (L2) tabs. In the General tab, click the + button to add a new L3 rule. Define the L3 rule: Field Action Name Enter a name for the rule. Source Hover over the field, then click the IP button to enter a single IP address or an IP range. When you're done, click Keep . Destination Hover over the field, then click the IP button to enter a single IP address or an IP range. When you're done, click Keep . Service Hover over the field, then click the IP button to add the relevant Protocol and Port . When you're done, click Keep . Action Select Allow or Deny . Direction Select In , Out or In/Out . Packet Type Select IPv4 , IPv6 or Any . Applied To Hover over the field, then click the + button to select whether to apply the rule to an edge, Org VDC network, virtual machine, Org VDC or security group. Select the specific object then click the right arrow to add it. When you're done, click Keep . When you're done, click Save changes . Creating a group of objects In some VDCs, you may want to use the same set of objects in multiple rules. For example, you may want to group web servers or other application servers together to use in a ruleset. Grouping objects keeps the firewall ruleset clean and easy to read. Creating a group of IP addresses You can create a group of IP addresses (IP set). This can be a combination of individual IPs and IP ranges. To create an IP set: In the Services dialog box, select the Grouping Objects tab. In the IP Sets tab, click the + button. Fill out the fields in the New IP Set dialog box: Field Action Name Enter a name for the IP set, ideally without any spaces or special characters. Description Enter a description for the IP set. IP Addresses Enter the IP addresses that you want to include in the IP set. You can include a combination of individual IP addresses and IP ranges. You can also use CIDR format, for example 192.168.1.1/24 . Inheritance Select this option to enable the IP set to be consumed by underlying scopes. When you're done, click Keep . Creating a group of MAC addresses If you want to use MAC address based filtering, it is easier to group the addresses in a MAC set. In a cloud environment, you need to be prepared for MAC address changes. Tip We recommend that you base firewall rules on VMs, Org VDC networks or security groups for L2 filtering. To create a MAC set: In the Services dialog box, click the Grouping Objects tab. In the MAC Sets tab, click the + button. Fill out the fields in the New MAC Set dialog box: Field Action Name Enter a name for the MAC set. Description Enter a description for the MAC set. MAC Addresses Enter the individual MAC addresses for your servers. Inheritance Select this option to enable the MAC set to be consumed by underlying scopes. When you're done, click Keep . Creating services and service groups Note Currently, you cannot create custom services or service groups. You can use predefined services with relevant protocols and ports in your firewall rules. Service groups contain multiple application ports and components, for example, Microsoft SQL Server requires a number of ports for all different services, which is simplified in the Microsoft SQL Server service group. Creating a security group Security groups enable you to categorise based on the access level required. If you have a number of servers performing similar roles and services, you can create a security group for them. Security groups also enable you to add dynamic members based on VM guest OS name, VM name and VM guest host name In the Services dialog box, click the Grouping Objects tab. In the Security Groups tab, click the + button. In the New Security Group dialog box, enter a Name and Description for the security group. In the Dynamic Member Sets section, click the + button and specify the criteria for the security group. In the image below, any existing VM with App in its name and any VM created in the future with App in its name will be included in the security group. In the Include Members section, instead of creating the members of the group dynamically, you can explicitly specify members to include in the group. Members can include VMs, Org VDC networks, IP sets, MAC sets or security tags. Select the type of object, then select individual objects and click the right arrow to add them to the group. In the Exclude Members section, you can exclude specific objects from the security group. Select the type of object, then select individuval objects and click the right arrow to exclude them from the group. When you're done, click Keep .

    "title": "How to configure IPsec VPN",
    "keywords": "How to configure IPsec VPN Overview VMware Cloud Director supports the following types of site-to-site VPN: Another edge gateway in the same organisation An edge gateway in another organisation (UKCloud or another vCloud service provider) A remote network offering IPsec VPN endpoint capability Depending on the type of connection required, you'll need to complete IP addressing for both ends, together with a shared secret, and indicate which VDC networks are allowed to connect to the VPN link. Before you begin Before you start configuring IPsec VPN settings, you'll need to make a note of the IP address of your edge gateway to use as your tunnel endpoint address. For more information, see How to find your allocated external IP addresses . Process overview To configure IPsec VPN, you need to follow these general steps (each of these steps in described in more detail later in this article): Configure the edge gateway IPsec VPN settings . Create the second VPN gateway . Configure the edge gateway firewall . Configure the external data centre gateway firewall . Validate the tunnel . Configuring edge gateway IPsec VPN settings In the VMware Cloud Director Virtual Data Center dashboard, select the VDC in which you want to configure IPsec VPN. In the left navigation panel, under Networking , select Edges . On the Edge Gateways page, select the edge that you want to configure and click Services . On the Edge Gateway page, select the VPN tab. On the IPsec VPN tab, select the IPsec VPN Sites tab. Click the + button. In the Add IPsec VPN dialog box, select the Enabled option. Select the Enable perfect forward secrecy (PFS) option if your on-premises/remote site has that capability. In the Name field, enter a name for your IPsec VPN. The Local ID field is usually set to the same value as the Local Endpoint (see next step). In the Local Endpoint field, enter the external IP address of your edge gateway (as noted in the Before you begin section above). In the Local Subnets field, enter the organisation networks that can be accessed via the VPN from the remote location. If you enter multiple local subnets, separate them with commas. The Peer ID field is usually set to the same value as the Peer Endpoint (see next step). In the Peer Endpoint field, enter the external IP address of your remote site or on-premises firewall or edge where the VPN is being set up. In the Peer Subnets field, enter the local subnet of your remote network that you want to access from your UKCloud VDC. For example, if your remote networks sit inside the 10.20.0.0/16 range, you could enter 10.20.0.0/16 here or limit your entry to a smaller subnet of that, for example, 10.20.0.0/25 . If you enter multiple subnets, separate them with commas. From the Encryption Algorithm list, select the most secure protocol that is supported by your on-premises gateway. From the Authentication list, select the authentication method that is supported by your on-premises gateway. If you want to use certificates, you need to configure those first on the Certificates tab. If you selected PSK as the authentication method, enter the shared secret used to authenticate and encrypt the connection. It must be an alphanumeric string between 32 and 128 characters that includes at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter and one number. This must be the same on both sites. We recommend setting the Diffie-Hellmann Group to DH14 or higher if your on-premises environment can support it. When you're done, click Keep to create the edge end of the VPN tunnel. Select the Activation Status tab and select the IPsec VPN Service Status option. Click Save changes . Creating the second VPN gateway You now need to create the endpoint of the VPN tunnel. If this is a different VDC or vOrg, go through the steps described above again to create the tunnel. When you've done that, you can change your firewall settings and validate the connection (see below). If you're connecting to an external data centre, you'll need to set up the tunnel on that premises. Creating an external data centre VPN gateway Although we can't provide specific instructions on setting up an external data centre gateway to connect to the edge gateway, we've provided information about some configuration requirements below. Important IPsec VPN supports only time-based rekeying. You must disable lifebytes rekeying. Starting in NSX 6.4.5, Triple DES (3DES) cypher algorithm is deprecated in IPsec VPN. IKE Phase 1 and Phase 2 IKE is a standard method for arranging secure, authenticated communications. Phase 1 parameters Phase 1 sets up mutual authentication of the peers, negotiates cryptographic parameters, and creates session keys. The supported Phase 1 parameters are: Main mode AES/AES256/AES-GCM (user configurable) Diffie-Hellman Group Pre-shared secret (user configurable) SA lifetime of 28800 seconds (eight hours) with no kbytes rekeying ISAKMP aggressive mode disabled Phase 2 parameters IKE Phase 2 negotiates an IPsec tunnel by creating keying material for the IPsec tunnel to use (either by using the IKE phase 1 keys as a base or by performing a new key exchange). The supported IKE Phase 2 parameters are: AES/AES256/AES-GCM (Will match the Phase 1 setting) ESP tunnel mode Diffie-Hellman Group Perfect forward secrecy for rekeying (only if it was switched on in both endpoints) SA lifetime of 3600 seconds (one hour) with no kbytes rekeying Selectors for all IP protocols, all ports, between the two networks, using IPv4 subnets Configuring the edge gateway firewall When the VPN tunnel is up and running, you'll need to create firewall rules on the edge gateway for any traffic passing over the tunnel. For how to do this, see How to create firewall rules . Key points to note: You need to create two firewall rules: one for each direction, that is, from data centre to VDC and from VDC to data centre. For data centre to VDC, set: Source as the source IP range for your external VDC/data centre network Destination as the destination IP range for your VDC network For VDC to data centre, set: Source as the source IP range for your VDC network Destination as the destination IP range for your data centre/VDC network Configuring the external data centre gateway firewall You may also need to create firewall rules and routes on your on-premises gateway or other internal firewall for traffic passing over the tunnel. This is outside of the scope of this article and will depend on your specific premises network configuration. Validating the tunnel When you've configured both ends of the IPsec tunnel, the connection should start without any issues. Note It can take up to two minutes after the tunnel is established to show that the VPN connection is active. Note Logs from the IPsec VPN cannot currently be used to aid fault finding. To verify the tunnel status: On the Edge Gateways page, select the edge that you want to validate and click Services . Select the Statistics tab and then the IPsec VPN tab. For each configured tunnel, if you can see a tick, the tunnel is up and running and operational. If any other status is shown, you'll need to review your configuration and any firewall rules. Note It can take up to two minutes after the tunnel is established to show that the VPN connection is active. You should now be able to send traffic via the VPN.

    "keywords": "How to configure an L2 VPN Overview UKCloud for VMware provides Layer 2 (L2) VPN functionality as part of its Advanced Management bundle (additional charges apply). With L2 VPN you can stretch the same L2 broadcast domain over an SSL tunnel across two edge gateways in different sites, meaning that you can move your workloads seamlessly between sites without having to change IP addresses. L2 VPN is an extension of the edge's SSL functionality. It enables you to configure a tunnel between two sites, extending a logical switch across both sites. The tunnel means that virtual machines (VMs) remain on the same subnet if they are moved between the two sites, enabling you to extend your data centre across multiple sites. An NSX edge at one site can provide all services to VMs on the other site. UKCloud L2 VPN functionality covers three scenarios: L2 connectivity between UKCloud regions Connectivity from your own on-premises site (with vSphere and NSX) to UKCloud L2 connectivity from any remote site (without vSphere and NSX) to UKCloud Before you begin Before enabling L2 VPN, consider the following: You must have purchased the Advanced Management bundle for your UKCloud for VMware service This service takes up one of your allocated IP addresses (primary or secondary) L2 VPN can be enabled only on a routed Org VDC network You cannot use SSL VPN on any edge gateway running L2 VPN You may encounter issues with IPsec VPN You cannot use load balancers using HTTPS on primary or secondary edge gateway addresses once L2 VPN is enabled You'll need to change any existing NAT and firewall rules using the primary or secondary IP of the edge for HTTPS If your remote site does not have vSphere or NSX, you'll need to deploy a standalone edge as the L2 VPN client (see Deploying a standalone edge as an L2 VPN client ) Configuring L2 VPN To set up L2 VPN, you need to configure an L2 VPN server on the destination edge and an L2 VPN client on the source edge. You must then enable the L2 VPN service on both the server and the client. If one of the sites that you want to stretch is not backed by NSX, you can deploy a standalone edge as the L2 VPN client on that site (see Deploying a standalone edge as an L2 VPN client ).

    "title": "How to configure a load balancer",
    "keywords": "How to configure a load balancer Overview One of the functions of the edge gateway is to act as a basic load balancer, distributing IP traffic to a pool of servers while appearing as a single virtual server. The load balancing methods offered are round-robin, IP hash, URI, HTTP header or least connected. Bear in mind, however, that the edge gateway load balancer is quite basic. If you need to meet more complex requirements, you'll need provide your own third-party virtual load balancer. Configuring a load balancer To configure a load balancer: In the VMware Cloud Director Virtual Data Center dashboard, select the VDC that contains the edge gateway in which you want to configure the load balancer. In the left navigation panel, under Networking , select Edges . On the Edge Gateways page, select the edge that you want to configure and click Services . On the Edge Gateway page, select the Load Balancer tab. On the Global Configuration , select the Enabled status option. Select the Acceleration Enabled status option if you want to use the Layer 4 engine rather than Layer 7. If you have a syslog server configured, select the Enable Logging option and select the Log Level . For more information about syslog servers, see How to access syslog data for your edge gateway Click Save changes . Configuring a server pool Server pools are the real servers that are masked by the load balancer.

    "keywords": "How to create a catalog Overview UKCloud provides a public catalog for you to use that contains standard virtual machine (VM) sizes and operating systems. The public catalog is a good place to start when you first deploy VMs into the UKCloud platform. However, you may want to create your own catalogs, containing specific applications or gold images, which you can then use to deploy VMs quickly. Creating a catalog The first step is to create an empty catalog: In the VMware Cloud Director menu bar, select Libraries . In the left navigation panel, under Content Libraries , select Catalogs . On the Catalogs page, click New to create a new catalog. In the Create Catalog dialog box, enter a Name for the catalog and give it a Description if needed. To specify a particular storage policy for the catalog, select the Pre-provision on specific storage policy option then select the desired Storage Policy : Tier1 is for high performance, high IOPS VMs Tier2 is for everything else less demanding (recommended for ISO and templates) When you're done, click OK . To make the catalog visible to others within your organisation, click the three vertical dots and select Share . In the Share Catalog dialog box, from the Share with radio buttons, select: All Users and Groups to share the catalog with everyone in the organisation. Specific Users and Groups to share the catalog with individual users or groups of users. Select the users and groups from the lists below by selecting the check box for the user or group and selecting the appropriate access level ( Read Only , Read/Write or Full Control ). When you've added all the people who you want to access the catalog, click Save . Populating a catalog There are two ways to populate a catalog: Create a template from an OVF package Create a template from an existing vApp Creating a template from an OVF package Note Depending on the file size and network speed, the upload may take some time. To upload an OVF package and assign it to a catalog: On the Libraries page, in the left navigation panel, under Content Libraries , select vApp Templates . On the vApps Templates page, click New . In the Create vApp template from OVF dialog box, select the source of the OVF either by entering a URL or clicking the Browse icon to locate the file on your computer. Tip You can select multiple files by pressing the CTRL key and selecting additional files. Click Next . On the Review Details page, confirm the details of the OVF template and then click Next . On the Select vApp Template Name page, enter a Name and Description for the template. From the Catalog list, select the catalog in which you want to put the OVF, then click Next . On the Ready to Complete page, review the details of the vApp template and when you're done, click Finish to deploy. Adding an existing vApp In the VMware Cloud Director Virtual Data Center dashboard, select the VDC in which the vApp you want to use is located. In the left navigation panel, select vApps . In the card for the vApp that you want to add to the catalog, select Actions then Add To Catalog . You can add both running and stopped vApps to the catalog, although it's worth noting that creating a catalog image from a running vApp could affect performance. In the Add to Catalog dialog box, from the Catalog list, select the catalog you want to add the vApp to. Give the vApp template a Name and Description and define whether vApps deployed using this template are identical or customisable. You can also overwrite an existing catalog item. If the catalog you're adding the vApp to is published externally, you'll see a warning. When you're done, click OK . You can check the progress by expanding the Recent Tasks section at the bottom of the VMware Cloud Director interface.

Although a vApp edge isn't as feature rich as a VDC edge, it enables you to create firewall and NAT rules to separate your VDC networks from your vApp virtual machines (VMs). This means you can create some quite complex networks to satisfy application needs. The vApp network diagram below shows the vApp edge. Creating a vApp network Note As you're going to be changing network settings, all VMs within the vApp must be powered off. In the VMware Cloud Director Virtual Data Center dashboard, select the VDC that contains the vApp. In the left navigation panel, select vApps .

The external IP address will be on the same subnet as the VDC network that connects to the vApp edge. Creating static routes Static routing at the vApp network level allows traffic to route between different vApp networks, across the VDC networks. The prerequisites for static routing are as follows: Static routing must be enabled for the VDC network you're connecting to (see How to create a static route ). The two vApp networks must be routed to the same VDC network. The vApp networks must be in vApps that have been started at least once. To add a static route: In the left navigation panel, select vApps . In the card for the vApp, select Details . Select Networks . Click the first vApp network to view its network settings.

Tip To create a new vApp, see How to create a vApp . In the Add VMs dialog box, click Add Virtual Machine . In the New VM dialog box, enter a Name , Computer Name and Description for your VM. Note Name is a name to identify the VM, Computer Name is the host name of the VM. The Computer Name is copied from the Name field but can contain only alphanumeric characters and hyphens so you may need to edit it if your VM Name contains spaces or special characters. As you're creating the VM from scratch (not from a template), from the Type radio buttons, select New . Select the OS Family to use for your VM, then from the Operating System list, select the specific OS that you want to use. From the Select a Size radio buttons, select a sizing option for your VM. You can select from Pre-defined Sizing Options or select Custom Sizing Options to enter specific compute, memory and storage settings. Tip Although you can build a VM to your own specification in terms of the number of vCPUs and amount of memory and disk space, you'll be billed based on the closest (next highest) match to a UKCloud pre-defined VM size. Given the flexibility of VMs, and the ability to change the number of vCPUs and amount of memory and disk space on the fly, it's often better to start small as you're not tied by the constraints of a physical server. Remember too, that more vCPUs or RAM won't necessarily make a server faster, and could cost a lot more. You need to understand how well your application can make use of multi-threading. For Windows, select at least two vCPUs if you think you'll need two or more in the future, as the multi-processor HAL will be loaded as part of the OS build. If you want to run virtualisation servers as a VM, you can edit the properties of the VM after it has been deployed and, in the Hardware section, select the Expose hardware-assisted CPU virtualization to guest OS check box. For example, you can run a Windows 2008 or 2012 server with Hyper‑V, or a VMware ESX host. In the Storage section, set the Storage Policy and Size of storage for the VM. You can also add more disks. Tip When setting the storage size, be sure to select the appropriate units ( MB , GB or TB ). In the Networking section, click Customize to configure network settings, if necessary. You can set the IP Mode to determine how IP addresses are assigned: DHCP VMware Cloud Director interacts with the OS via VMware Tools to use DHCP rather than static IPs. You'll need to define a DHCP server on your edge gateway. Check with UKCloud or your organisation administrator that this is set up before you use it. IP Pool is the usual method, which injects an IP address into the VM via VMware Tools from a list of available IP addresses. The address may vary with each boot, but there is a check box to keep IP address assignments elsewhere within the UI once the VMs are created. Manual IP is similar to IP Pool, but you need to enter a valid IP Address from the pool, which the VM will then keep. Tip You can connect the VM to multiple networks, by clicking Add . When you're done, click OK . Back in the Add VMs dialog box, you can add more VMs or click Add when you're done. The VM will be deployed without any operating system. Installing an operating system into the VM When you create a VM from scratch, it's initially deployed without any operating system. So, after you've created it, you need to install the appropriate operating system. On the card for the vApp that contains the VM, click Actions then select Power On . This starts the vApp and all the VMs within it. In the card for the vApp that contains the new VM, click Details . Select Virtual Machines . Click the VM Console option for the VM. Tip For a standalone VM, in the left navigation panel, under Compute , select Virtual Machines to view a list of all VMs within the VDC. Then, in the card for your new VM, click VM Console . As with a physical server, no virtual CD or DVD is available at first boot, so the server will attempt to PXE boot. In the main VMware Cloud Director interface (not the console), in the row for your VM, select the actions menu (three dots) then Insert Media . In the Insert CD dialog box, select the ISO image you want to mount from a catalog, then click Insert . In the row for the VM, select the actions menu (three dots) then Reset to reset the VM so that it picks up the virtual CD/DVD. After a short while the VM will start the boot process and pick up the CD/DVD. Resize the VM console if necessary or go to full screen. Carry out the operating system install as normal. When you've finished, remember to install VMware Tools (for more information, see VMware Tools installation ).

Alternatively, if your VMs are in the ESSENTIAL service level then these will not be backed up meaning CBT will not be enabled. The following options are available to ensure reliable simultaneous deployment: Inform us of a newly created vApp template. If we're informed on the day of creation, we can disable CBT for the vApp template allowing you to start deploying from template right away. If we're not informed on the day, our automatic backup script will run overnight and the template will be added to our backup software with the default Enable CBT option enabled. We will then have to disable this to undo any changes it made to the VM overnight before any simultaneous deployment can occur. Use the ESSENTIAL service level, which does not provide any backup functionality. This means that CBT will never get enabled on any of the vApp templates (useful for mass deployment of vApp templates).

    "title": "How to install and configure OpenVPN",
    "keywords": "How to install and configure OpenVPN Overview Secure remote access to the cloud is essential to cloud adoption and use. UKCloud for VMware comes with a dedicated edge gateway, providing a simple and easy-to-use solution that supports IPsec site-to-site virtual private networks (VPNs) and a limited number of remote access client VPNs designed for occasional use. If you require a more flexible or scalable solution, you can deploy your own choice of virtual appliances (either open-source solutions, such as OpenVPN or commercial solutions from a supplier, such as Cisco, F5 or Palo Alto), instead of using the limited VPN service provided with the default edge gateway. This article details the steps required to obtain, deploy and configure an OpenVPN virtual appliance to obtain remote access to your virtual data centres (VDCs) running on the UKCloud platform. Note OpenVPN is a licensed product. Without a licence key, you are limited to only two concurrent VPN connections. If you require additional concurrent connections, you'll need to obtain and install a licence key. Before you begin To ensure you're running the latest release of OpenVPN, we recommend that you download the latest version of the appliance directly from the OpenVPN website: https://openvpn.net/downloads/openvpn-as-latest-vmware.ova Preparing your virtual data centre Create a new VDC network To secure your environment, we recommend that you deploy the OpenVPN appliance into a new, routed VDC network. Ideally, no other virtual machines (VMs) should connect to this network. This enables you to tightly control access from VPN clients to the VMs in your environment using firewall rules on the edge gateway. However, if you're approaching the network interface limit of your edge gateway, it's possible to deploy the OpenVPN appliance into an existing network. For more information, see How to create a routed VDC network . Configuring the edge gateway After you've created the network, you'll need to configure the edge gateway to control access to the VMs in your environment by creating: A Source NAT rule to allow the OpenVPN appliance outbound access to the internet. A Destination NAT rule to allow inbound access from the internet. A firewall rule to allow inbound access from the internet on port 443 . One or more firewall rules to allow users connected to the OpenVPN appliance to access VMs on other networks for administration purposes. Note that all VPN users will be NATed to the IP address of the OpenVPN appliance. One or more firewall rules to allow access from trusted environments to the OpenVPN appliance on the admin port ( 943 by default, but can be changed). For more information, see How to create NAT rules and How to create firewall rules . Deploying the OpenVPN appliance Tip You may need to run the commands in the following steps as root (sudo). To deploy the OpenVPN appliance: In the VMware Cloud Director Virtual Data Center dashboard, select the VDC in which you want to deploy the OpenVPN appliance. In the left navigation panel, under Compute , select vApps . Click New , then select Add vApp from OVF . Select the OpenVPN OVA that you downloaded then click Next . Review the details of the OVA to confirm that it's the right image then click Next . The appliance will be deployed as a single VM inside a vApp. Provide a Name and (optional) Description for the vApp then click Next . Provide a valid NetBIOS host name and your desired storage policy then click Next . Configure the network by selecting Switch to the advanced networking workflow . Select the network adapter type, network and IP pool assignment ( Manual ), assign a valid IP from within your range, then click Next . Select the number of vCPUs, sockets and memory this appliance will have then click Next . Review the details then click Finish to deploy the vApp and appliance. When the vApp has deployed and is powered on, you'll need to reset (reboot) the VM before logging in for the first time to force the networking changes made during VMWare's guest customisations to take effect before you start configuring OpenVPN. Performing initial configuration To perform initial configuration: In VMware Cloud Director (under Compute > Virtual Machines ), open the console for your OpenVPN VM. Tip If you haven't already done so, you may need to download the VMware Remote Console. Log in to the VM as the root user. Tip To obtain the root password: In the card for the VM, click Details then select Guest OS Customization and make a note of the password. You'll be prompted to answer a series of questions: Licence agreement: --- Enter yes to accept. Will this be the primary Access Server node? --- Enter yes . Please specify the network interface and IP address to be used by the Admin Web UI -- If the guest customisations were applied correctly, this should default to eth0 , which should be configured with an IP address on the network you selected during deployment. Please specify the port number for the Admin Web UI --- Enter your desired port number, or accept the default of 943 . A separate port is not strictly needed for administration but is recommended. Please specify the TCP port number for the OpenVPN Daemon --- We recommend that you use the default of 443 where possible as the use of a non-standard port may cause problems when connecting from corporate networks. Should client traffic be routed by default through VPN? --- Entering yes will prevent your client device from accessing any other networks (for example, your corporate network) while the VPN is connected. For ease of use, we suggest you answer no to this question. Should client DNS traffic be routed by default through the VPN? --- If you answered yes to the previous question, all traffic will be routed through the VPN anyway, so your answer here will not matter. If you answered no to the previous question, you'll probably want to answer no to this question so that your DNS queries are answered by the usual servers. Use local authentication via internal DB? --- Enter yes unless you want to authenticate users from an existing directory service (Active Directory/LDAP). Should private subnets be accessible to clients by default? --- Answer yes to enable access to your cloud networks via the VPN. Do you wish to login to the Admin UI as \"openvpn\"? --- Answer yes to create a local user account named openvpn . If you answer no , you'll need to set up a different user name and password. Please specify your OpenVPN-AS license key --- If you've purchased a licence, enter the licence key, otherwise leave this blank. When you've completed the setup wizard, you'll need to create user accounts and passwords on the local operating system (unless you configured an LDAP directory). If you opted to use the default openvpn account, you'll need to configure its password: #passwd openvpn Press ^D to log off the console, but before you do so, there are some additional system configurations, detailed in the following sections, that you might want to perform while you're connected to the console. Check the DNS resolver configuration is in place During our tests, the DNS resolver configuration was not added by the VMware customisations. Enter the following command: # pico /etc/network/interfaces Use the arrow keys to scroll down. At the first free line specify your DNS servers, for example: dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 Press ^O to save the file, then press Enter to confirm the file name. Press ^X to exit the text editor. Restart the networking service for the change to take effect: # systemctl restart systemd-networkd.service Configure the keyboard The default configuration is for a US keyboard. To reconfigure for UK: Enter the following command: # dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration Step through the wizard. There's no need to restart anything when you're finished. Apply updates It's a good idea to apply the latest upgrades to the system. Enter the following command: # apt-get update && apt-get upgrade You'll be prompted to approve the installation of any updates. Install NTP Installing NTP is good practice anyway, but is required if you intend to use two-factor authentication via Google Authenticator. Enter the following command: # apt-get install ntp When the installation is complete, update the configuration file to point to UKCloud's NTP servers. # pico /etc/ntp.conf Use the arrow keys to scroll down until you reach the lines beginning with server . Change the first two lines to reflect the UKCloud servers, and comment out the remaining two lines. Contact UKCloud Support for the UKCloud server IP addresses. Configuring administration options To configure administration options: Log on to the admin interface at: https://<ip_address>:943/admin To set the hostname, under Configuration , select Network Settings and then set the Hostname or IP Address to either a public IP address or a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that your client will be able to resolve. Save the settings on this page. Under Configuration , select VPN settings and, in the Routing section, add any additional subnets that your VPN users should have access to. These will usually be the IP subnets configured on all of your VDC networks. This is the minimum configuration required to be able to establish a VPN connection. If you want to create new user accounts, under User Management , select User Permissions . You can configure the password for each account by clicking the Show link in the More Settings column. Note Be sure to use complex passwords. Logging in and connecting You can download the VPN client software and connection profiles directly from the appliance by browsing to the following location and logging in with a valid user name and password: https://<ip_address>/ The downloaded client software and profile includes the client certificate that is required for authentication. When you've installed the client software or profile, you can initiate connections directly from the client. Securing the appliance We strongly recommend that you further secure the appliance by making the changes suggested in the following sections. Change all default passwords If you've not already done so, change the root password to something more secure. Log in to the OpenVPN VM console as the root user. Enter the following command: # passwd Lock down unused ports with iptables The OpenVPN configuration utility adds the required ALLOW entries to iptables automatically. To deny all other traffic, enter the following command: # iptables -A INPUT -j DROP Enable two-factor authentication via Google Authenticator You can enable two-factor authentication via the OpenVPN administration interface. Log on to the administration interface with the default account at: https://<ip_address>/admin From the menu, select Authentication then General . Set Enable Google Authenticator MFA to Yes . Note Users will need to enter or scan the Google Authenticator secret by logging into the client portal ( http://<ip_address>/ ). When they've configured the secret, they should click the I scanned the QR code button to enforce two-factor authentication. Lock down the Admin Web UI and Client Web UI By default, both Admin and Client UIs are accessible over port 443 . This can pose a security risk if you've opened port 443 to the internet to allow users to connect from anywhere. Besides the obvious risk of unauthorised access to the administration interface, should an attacker gain access to the client interface, they'll be able to download the client certificates necessary to establish a VPN connection. You can limit the administration and client interfaces so that they are accessible only via the administration port number ( 943 by default). This enables you to restrict access to this port to a trusted IP address or network, while allowing VPN access on port 443 from anywhere. Your users will need to log in initially from the trusted network to install the client software, client certificate and configure Google Authenticator, before being able to establish VPN access. To lock down the administration and client interfaces: Log on to the administration interface with the default account at: https://<ip_address>/admin Under Configuration , select Server Network Settings . Under Service Forwarding , in the VPN Server section, set Admin Web Server and Client Web Server to No . Disable root SSH login If connecting via SSH, it's best practice to connect with a non-privileged account, then sudo to root if needed. This prevents an attacker from brute-forcing the root password. Enter the following command: # pico /etc/ssh/sshd_config Use the arrow keys to scroll down the file, and change the PermitRootLogin to no . Disable the default account During the initial setup, you created an user name and password to log in to the administration interface. This account, with the name openvpn , is configured to be always active, disregarding its status in the User Permissions area. In addition, if you configured two-factor authentication via Google Authenticator, this is not enforced for the default account. To disable the default account: Enter the following command: # pico /usr/local/openvpn_as/etc/as.conf Use the arrow keys to scroll down the file until you see entries starting with boot_pam_users . Comment out the entry for the user name you chose for the default account. Usually this is the boot_pam_users.0= entry. Restart the OpenVPN service for the change to take effect: # systemctl restart openvpnas.service More help If you have any issues regarding the updating or support of OpenVPN, contact the UKCloud support team by raising a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal.

To check this, open PowerShell and enter $psversiontable at the prompt. You should see something like the following: If PSVersion is less than 3.0, you'll need to upgrade. The v4 package is available here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=40855 . Python You'll need to install Python 2.7: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2716/ You'll then need to install the package: https://pypi.org/project/requests/ Getting your credentials The first thing you'll need to do is log in to the Portal and get your API credentials: Select API from the menu on the top right, you'll then get all of the credentials for each of the Cloud Director Orgs that you have access to. Note down the username field for the one you are going to interact with. For more detailed instructions, see How to access VMware Cloud Director through the Cloud Director API . Getting Started PowerShell Copy and paste the following script into a .psm1 file: $Global:SkyscapeURL = \"https://<API URL from Portal>/api\" $Global:Authorization = \"\" $Global:Accept = \"application/*+xml;version=34.0\" $Global:xvCloudAuthorization = \"\" Function New-vCloudLogin($Username,$Password) { $Pair = \"$($Username):$($Password)\" $Bytes = [System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes($Pair) $Base64 = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($Bytes) $Global:Authorization = \"Basic $base64\" $headers = @{ Authorization = $Global:Authorization; Accept = $Global:Accept} $Res = Invoke-WebRequest -Method Post -Headers $headers -Uri \"$($Global:SkyscapeURL)/sessions\" $Global:xvCloudAuthorization = $res.headers[\"x-vcloud-authorization\"].tostring() } Function Get-vCloudRequest($EndPoint) { $headers = @{\"Accept\" = $Global:Accept; \"x-vcloud-authorization\" = $Global:xvCloudAuthorization} [xml]$Response = Invoke-WebRequest -Method Get -Headers $headers -Uri \"$($Global:SkyscapeURL)/$EndPoint\" Return $Response } You'll now have two new functions available to you; New-vCloudLogin and Get-vCloudRequest .

UKCloud stores metadata against each VDC to indicate where within the platform the VDC resides. Using this metadata, you can locate your VDC by site, region and zone. For more information about the organisation of the UKCloud platform, see Understanding sites, regions and zones . Knowing where your VDCs are located can be useful for: Determining how resilient your applications are Determining how Planned or Emergency Maintenance or an unplanned outage may affect your applications Providing additional information to help with support call resolution This article describes how to find out where your VDC is within the UKCloud platform. You can use the VMware Cloud Director Tenant Portal or the API. The information provided by the VDC metadata is read-only. If you want to change the location of a VDC, raise a Support Request from the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. Note If you want to find the location of a specific VM within a VDC, you can use VM location. For more information, see How to use VM location . Finding the location of a VDC (Tenant Portal) You can view a VDC's metadata in the VMware Cloud Director Tenant Portal to find out where the VDC is located. In the VMware Cloud Director Virtual Data Center dashboard, select the VDC that you want to locate. In the left navigation panel, under Settings , select Metadata . The following fields indicate the location of your VDC: provider-site - indicates the site in which your VDC is located: Farnborough or Corsham provider-region - indicates the region in which your VDC is located, for example 1 or 5 . provider-zone - indicates the zone in which your VDC is located, for example 1(AF2) or B A note about Synchronous Protection Note Synchronous Protection is no longer available as a protection option for UKCloud for VMware. UKCloud offers two alternative data protection solutions: Jounaling Protection (Zerto) and Snapshot Protection . Contact your Service Delivery Manager for more information. We will continue to provide support to customers who previously added Synchronous Protection to their environment, although we would encourage considering using Journaling Protection instead. If you set up your VDC to use Synchronous Protection, then the VDC is stretched across multiple sites. The metadata indicates this as follows: provider-protection-synchronous is Yes provider-site - indicates that your VDC is stretched across both sites: Farnborough or Corsham provider-region - indicates that your VDC is stretched across multiple regions, for example 1 or 2 provider-zone - indicates that your VDC is stretched across multiple zones, for example 1(AE1) or 2(AE2) Finding the location of a VDC (Cloud Director API) You can also find the location of your VDC by calling the Cloud Director API. For more information about the Cloud Director API, see the VMware Cloud Director API . For example, to retrieve all the metadata for a specified VDC, call the GET /vcd/<id>/metadata endpoint.

    "title": "How to manage Snapshot Protection for your VMs",
    "keywords": "How to manage Snapshot Protection for your VMs Overview Protection technologies are tools used to enable you to design resilience into your cloud solutions. They protect data and provide you with the ability to recover from system outages - either caused by a disruption to the physical delivery of a service or as a result of corruption of your primary system. The UKCloud platform offers a variety of protection options, including Snapshot Protection. Snapshot Protection automatically takes an image of your virtual machine (VM) every 24 hours and stores the image outside the core platform for either 14 or 28 days, depending on your chosen snapshot retention profile. How does Snapshot Protection work? By default, VMs deployed on the UKCloud platform do not come with any protection services enabled. If you want Snapshot Protection for your VM, you must explicitly add it. When you add Snapshot Protection to a VM, the VM is added to a daily automated backup. Backups are automatically taken for the VM once every 24 hours, sometime between the hours of 20:00 and 08:00. The status of a VM's backup is reported daily in the UKCloud Portal by 10:00, but typically within minutes of the close of the backup window. If you encounter a problem with your VM, raise a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal and we can use one of your VM backups to restore the whole VM image to a new VM in your VDC. You can then use this image to restore the VM or restore any required data to your original VM. For more detailed information, see the Snapshot Protection Service Scope . Checking a VM's Snapshot Protection status You can use the UKCloud Portal to see whether a VM uses Snapshot Protection, find out which snapshot retention policy is currently applied to a VM, or check the status of your VM's snapshots. Log in to the UKCloud Portal. For more detailed steps, see the Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal . If necessary, switch to the account that the VM belongs to. Click My VMs . Select the compute service (vOrg) that the VM belongs to. Select the My VMs tab. From the Currently viewing for VDC list, select the VDC that the VM belongs to. Click the VMs tab. The icon in VM Backup column shows the status of each VM's most recent backup: Icon Description Backup of the VM was successful The VM has been excluded from backups A backup has not yet been created for a VM that has recently been included in backups Backup of the VM was unsuccessful The VM has been excluded from backups but has not yet reached the end of the previous retention period (when the end retention period is reached, the icon will change to the grey minus sign) Tip You can hover over the icon to see a description of the backup status. The button in the Default Policy column shows the Snapshot Protection option currently applied to the VM: 14‑day - VM uses Snapshot Protection, with backups retained for 14 days 28-day - VM uses Snapshot Protection, with backups retained for 28 days Manage - VM is currently excluded from Snapshot Protection Processing - A change in status to Snapshot Protection is currently being processed for the VM Failed - A change in the status of Snapshot Protection for the VM failed; contact the UKCloud support team to resolve this issue. To find out more detail about the most recent backup of a VM, or to view information about previous backups, click the VM Name . In the VMs Info page, the following fields provide information about the most recent backup of the VM: Additional information - additional information about the backup, for example if the backup was removed from the daily automated backup, if the retention period was changed, or further details of any failures. Last backup - the status of the most recent backup Retention length - how long the backup will be kept for: 14 days or 28 days Backup status - when the most recent backup was attempted The Snapshot Protection Backups section of the page provides information about previous backups. This covers the entire retention policy period (14 or 28 days). Information includes: Status - the status of the backup Slot - the backup slot during which the backup was taken Start - the date and time when the backup started End - the date and time when the backup ended Snapshot Removal Start - the date and time when the snapshot consolidation process started (that is, writing back any changes to the VM that occurred during the time it was locked for backup) Snapshot Removal End - the date and time when the snapshot consolidation process ended The Snapshot Protection Policy History section of the page lists any recent changes to the snapshot retention policy for the VM. Status - The status of the policy change Date Requested - The date and time when the policy change was requested User - The user who requested the change Protection Period - The new protection period introduced by the policy change Reason for Change - The reason for the policy change Action - The type of policy change request Click Manage my Backups to raise a Service Request related to your backups via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal, for example, to restore a backup. To view all the VM information in a single table, click the Actions tab and select Export VMs . You can save this page to view offline and analyse further. Managing Snapshot Protection for a VM By default, VMs deployed on the UKCloud platform do not come with any protection services enabled. You can use the UKCloud Portal to add Snapshot Protection to your VM. You can also use the Portal to change the snapshot retention policy for your backups and to remove Snapshot Protection from your VM. Access the My VMs tab for your compute service. For detailed steps for how to do this, see the first few steps in Checking a VM's snapshot status . From the Currently viewing for VDC list, select the VDC that the VM belongs to. Click the VMs tab. In the Default Policy column, click the green button. The label on the button will depend on the currently applied policy: Manage if there is currently no snapshot retention policy applied to the VM 14-day if the VM's snapshot retention policy is currently 14 days 28-day if the VM's snapshot retention policy is currently 28 days In the Snapshot Protection Policy dialog box, from the New Protection Policy list, select the snapshot retention policy that you want to apply to the VM: 14-day to apply a 14-day snapshot retention policy to the VM 28-day to apply a 28-day snapshot retention policy to the VM No Backup to turn Snapshot Protection off for the VM Note If you remove Snapshot Protection from a VM, you should consider alternatives to ensure the integrity of your data in the case of disruption. In addition to Snapshot Protection, UKCloud offers Journaling Protection options, or you may want to implement your own protection solution, possibly utilising our Cloud Storage service. In the Reason For Change field, provide a reason for the change to the existing snapshot retention policy. Click Submit . The button in the Snapshot Protection column changes to an amber Processing button. When the changes have been applied, the button changes back to green with a label indicating the VM's snapshot retention policy ( 14-day or 28-day ) or Manage if you have turned off Snapshot Protection. The amount of time it takes for your changes to take place depends on how many requests are in the queue. If there are any problems with the request, the button in the Snapshot Protection column changes to a red Failed button; in this situation, contact UKCloud Support for further assistance. Backup status information is updated daily on the UKCloud Portal by 10:00, but typically within minutes of the close of the backup window. Note If you remove a VM from backups, the status icon for the VM will display as a red cross until the end of the previously selected retention period. When the end of the retention period is reached, the status icon will change to the grey minus sign. Managing Snapshot Protection for a VDC You can specify a snapshot retention policy to apply to all the VMs in a VDC. You can apply the policy to all new VMs or to all new and existing VMs. Access the My VMs tab for your compute service. For detailed steps for how to do this, see the first few steps in Checking a VM's snapshot status . From the Currently viewing for VDC list, select the VDC that you want to apply Snapshot Protection to. Select the Snapshot Protection tab. Next to Default VM Snapshot Protection , click the green button. The label on the button will depend on the currently applied policy: Manage if there is currently no default snapshot retention policy applied to the VDC 14-day if the default snapshot retention policy is currently 14 days 28-day if the default snapshot retention policy is currently 28 days In the Snapshot Protection Policy dialog box, from the New Protection Policy list, select the snapshot retention policy that you want to apply to the VMs in this VDC: 14-day if you want to apply a 14-day snapshot retention policy to the VDC 28-day if you want to apply a 28-day snapshot retention policy to the VDC No Backup if you do not want to apply a default snapshot retention policy to the VDC In the Reason For change field, provide a reason for the change to the existing snapshot retention policy. If you want to apply the chosen snapshot retention policy to existing VMs in the VDC as well as new VMs, select the Apply new policy to all existing VMs? check box. Note If you select this check box, all existing VMs will switch to the new policy when you click Submit. You will not be able to rollback this change. Click Submit . The label of the Default VM Snapshot Protection button changes to indicate the new snapshot retention policy ( 14-day or 28-day ) or to Manage if you have turned off Snapshot Protection. Any new VMs created within the VDC will now use the specified snapshot retention policy, although you can override this for individual VMs if required by following the steps in Managing snapshot protection for a VM . If you selected Apply to all existing VMs , the button changes to an amber Processing button. When the changes have been applied, the button changes back to green with a label indicating the VDC's snapshot retention policy ( 14-day or 28-day ) or Manage if you have turned off Snapshot Protection. If the VDC contains a lot of VMs, the process of updating the policy for all existing VMs may take several minutes to complete. Backup status information is updated daily on the UKCloud Portal by 10:00, but typically within minutes of the close of the backup window. Note When you exit the Snapshot Protection Policy dialog box, the Currently viewing for VDC list on the My VMs tab resets to the first VDC listed under the compute service. You'll need to reselect your VDC from the list before continuing. The Default Snapshot Protection Policy History section of the page lists any recent changes to the snapshot protection policy for the VDC. The Recent VM Snapshot Protection Policy Actions section of the page lists any recent changes to the snapshot protection policy for VMs in the VDC. Monitoring the status of Snapshot Protection You can monitor the status of Snapshot Protection across an entire compute service to get a general overview of how your VDCs and VMs are protected. Log in to the UKCloud Portal. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud Portal . If necessary, switch to the account that the compute service belongs to. In the navigation panel, expand Reports and click Backup Summary . Click the link for the compute service for which you want to view Snapshot Protection information. The Snapshot Protection Summary page provides the following information for the selected compute service: Success Rate (Last 24 Hours) - The percentage of successful VM backups in the previous night's backups Success Rate (Within Retention Period) - The overall percentage success rate of all backups across the compute service Number of VMs Protected - The total number of VMs successfully protected in the previous night's backups Number of VMs Not Protected - The total number of VMs with Snapshot Protection that were not successfully protected in the previous night's backups VM Snapshot Protection Failures - A list of the VMs that encountered a Snapshot Protection failure in previous night's backups Next steps For more information about working with your VMs, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware .

    "href": "articles/vmware/vmw-how-manipulate-power-states-powercli.html",
    "title": "How to manipulate power states with PowerCLI",
    "keywords": "How to manipulate power states with PowerCLI Overview PowerCLI is a command line interface tool developed by VMware and built upon Microsoft PowerShell. The tool is designed to enable manipulation, automation, management and control over vSphere and VMware Cloud Director assets. PowerCLI can help you realise some of the fundamental benefits of cloud computing, such as on-demand self-service. Controlling virtual machine power states programmatically, to turn off compute elements when they are no longer required, can help you save up to 70% on your compute costs by taking advantage of hourly billing. For example, you could power off an internal room-booking system when staff are at home during evenings and weekends. This article describes the basics of how to use PowerCLI to power VMs and vApps on and off via a script, and then automate the script so that it can run unattended. Before you begin PowerCLI is a module for Powershell. As Powershell is a Microsoft tool, it is advised that you install it on a Windows-based environment. The latest version of PowerCLI, with all required subcomponents, is available from the VMware website at https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/PowerCLI/ . If you're not running Windows in your environment, contact UKCloud support or a UKCloud Cloud Architect for specific advice on open source alternatives that are available. UKCloud recommends installing PowerCLI onto a reference management machine, separate from the controlled environment. This management machine should not be powered off, and could be a standalone virtual server within UKCloud, or any other Windows machine with HTTP access to the UKCloud API URL. You may also find a good script editor useful. There are several available for free, such as PowerShell ISE, Visual Studio Code and Notepad++. Connecting to the UKCloud cloud platform Your PowerCLI script needs to connect to VMware Cloud Director using a privileged account, so we recommend that you create a user in the UKCloud Portal with only API Only access. This ensures that the account cannot be used to access the GUI, limiting the risk associated with an administrative account. Also, as an API Only account cannot utilise additional security features, such as Google 2-Step Verification, it is advisable to restrict the account so that it can log in only from specific IP addresses. You can configure these permissions under the Contacts section of the UKCloud Portal (for more information, see How to manage permissions for VMware Cloud Director ). You usually log in to the portal using an email address and password. For API Only access a unique user ID is generated for each UKCloud account you want to log into. You need to specify these unique identifiers when running the scripts to connect to the UKCloud environment. You can find API credentials and URL details on the UKCloud Portal when you have logged in: In the top right corner of the page, click your username and then select API . The API page provides a view of your personal credentials for accessing the vCloud API. The example in this article uses the Assured OFFICIAL, internet connected security domain. The API URL , Username and Password are unique to each security domain and you should check via the Portal before connecting. The API URL for PowerCLI requires you to omit the https:// from the start, so for the above example the actual endpoint you would use is: api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com To connect to the UKCloud platform with PowerCLI: On the reference server with PowerCLI installed, open PowerCLI: Enter the following command: Connect-CIServer -server \"<API URL>\" -Org \"<ORGNAME>\" -Username \"<USERNAME>\" -Password \"<PASSWORD>\" Make sure to change the inputs (in <angled brackets>) to your unique account details. When you've successfully connected, you can use PowerCLI commands to manipulate objects within your connected VDC organisation. For more information on PowerCLI, there's a wide range of documentation from VMware, or generally available from a standard web search. We recommend that you start with the VMware blog pages: https://blogs.vmware.com/PowerCLI . Using PowerCLI to control object power states To retrieve the vApp that you want to control the power state of, use the Get-CIVApp cmdlet and assign the results to a variable, for example: $vApps = $Get-CIVapp This returns all of the vApps and put them into a variable. You'll want to specify which vApp you want to change the power state of by filtering for the right name, for example: $MyVApp = Get-CIVapp | Where {$_.Name -match \"My vApp\"} This returns any vApp in your Organisation where the name contains the string My vApp . To control the power state, use the Start-CIVApp and Stop-CIVAppGuest cmdlets. Important You should use the -RunAsync parameter as this will hand the task over to vCloud. If you don't use this, the task can fail if it takes too long or for any number of other issues that won't happen if vCloud is handling the task. Here is how this looks: $MyVApp | Start-CIVApp -RunASync $MyVApp | Stop-CIVAppGuest -RunASync You may also want to create a check so that the script turns the vApp on or off depending on it's current power state. You can do this by checking the current status and starting or stopping the vApp accordingly: If ($MyVApp.Status -match \"On\"){ $MyVApp | Stop-CIVAppGuest -RunASync }else{$MyVApp | Start-CIVApp} You may want put some measures in place to force a shutdown using Stop-CIVapp . For example, in the event that the vApp fails to power down after five minutes, you could have the following: If ($MyVApp.Status -match \"On\"){ $MyVApp | Stop-CIVAppGuest -RunASync Start-Sleep -Seconds 300 If ($MyVApp.Status -NotMatch \"PoweredOff\"){ $MyVApp | StopCIVapp -RunAsync } }else{$MyVApp | Start-CIVApp} Scheduling the script Now that you've written a script to control the power state as you intend, you'll want some method of running it at a time you have determined. To do this, you'll want to use the Windows machine you created earlier. You'll be able to use Windows Task Scheduler to facilitate this. Here, we'll go through a simple task to schedule the startup of the My vApp vApp at 7am every weekday. Open up Task Scheduler by going to: Start > Administrative Tools > Task Scheduler . In Task Scheduler , select Create Task on the right: In the Create Task dialog box, enter a Name for your task. Under Security options , select the radio button for Run whether user is logged on or not and select Run with highest privileges . To add a trigger to tell Task Scheduler when to run the task, select the Triggers tab, then select New at the bottom. To make the task run on weekdays at 7am, in the New Trigger dialog box, select Weekly on the left, enter the Start time, then select just the week days: Click OK when you're done. To add an action to tell Task Scheduler what it needs to run at those times, select the Actions tab, then select New . In the New Action dialog box, in the Program/script field, enter powershell.exe . In the Add arguments field, enter the file path to your script, using the following format (including quotation marks): \"& 'C:\\<Your script folder>\\<Script name>.ps1'\" Click OK to add the action, then click OK again. You'll be prompted to enter some credentials. Enter the administrator credentials of the Windows box you're using to run the script. Next steps As previously mentioned, this article helps you learn how to start to manipulate power states within your cloud environment. You should use this as the first building block to get your solution realising the benefits of elastic on-demand compute with hourly billing. Why pay for a service you are only using for 60% of the time when you can achieve dramatic cost savings with a simple script? Not all VMs and vApps are candidates for being powered down. For example, the work involved in getting a large database consistent and up and running may outweigh the cost benefits of automating the power state. There are lots of ways you could enhance this, such as writing out to a log file to provide a more auditable trace for management, adding email alerting or tie-ins with other third party services (such as Nagios, SCCM, and so on).

    "keywords": "How to migrate vApps between virtual data centres Overview If you have multiple virtual data centres (VDCs), you may find that you want to migrate vApps from VDC to VDC; whether that be from a test and dev environment into production or between VDCs with different service levels. There are two ways to migrate vApps between VDCs: copy and move. This article describes how to use these different methods to migrate your VDCs. Copying a vApp You may want to copy your vApp from one VDC to another VDC, leaving the original vApp in the source VDC that you can continue to use. You can perform the vApp copy operation on running vApps. Note As this is a copy operation, this will create additional VMs which will be charged at the standard UKCloud rate. To copy a vApp: In VMware Cloud Director, select the VDC that contains the vApp you want to copy. In the left navigation panel, under Compute , select vApps . In the card for the vApp that you want to copy, select Actions then Copy to . In the Copy dialog box, enter a Name for the copied vApp and select which VDC you want to migrate it to. You can also change the storage policy for each virtual machines (VMs) within the vApp. When you're happy with the configuration, click OK to begin the copy operation. Note The copy operation may take some time and the performance of any running VMs within the source vApp may be impacted due to the copy process. Moving a vApp You may want to completely move your vApp from one VDC to another VDC. This will remove the vApp from the source VDC and move it to the destination. To perform this operation, the vApp must be powered off. To move a vApp: In VMware Cloud Director, select the VDC that contains the vApp you want to move. In the left navigation panel, under Compute , click vApps . In the card for the vApp that you want to move, select Actions then Move to . In the Move dialog box, select which VDC you want to migrate the vApp to. You can also change the storage policy for each VMs within the vApp. When you're happy with the configuration, click OK to begin the move operation. Note It may take some time to move the vApp from one VDC to another. When the move operation is complete, power the vApp back on by selecting Actions then Power On .

Exporting Edge Gateway configuration data Install PowerCLI from VMware: https://code.vmware.com/web/tool/12.0.0/vmware-powercli Copy the following function and paste it into a .psm1 file: function Get-EdgeConfig ($EdgeGateway) { $Edgeview = $EdgeGateway | get-ciview $webclient = New-Object system.net.webclient $webclient.Headers.Add(\"x-vcloud-authorization\",$EdgeView.Client.SessionKey) $webclient.Headers.Add(\"accept\",\"application/*+xml;version=34.0\") $edgeview.id -match \"(?<=urn:vcloud:gateway:).*\" $edgeID = $Matches[0] $requrl = \"https://\" + $global:DefaultCIServers.name + \"/network/edges/\" + $edgeID [xml]$EGWConfXML = $webclient.DownloadString($requrl) $Holder = \"\" | Select Firewall,NAT,LoadBalancer,DHCP $Holder.Firewall = $EGWConfXML.edge.features.firewall.firewallrules.firewallrule $Holder.NAT = $EGWConfXML.edge.features.nat.natrules.natrule $Holder.LoadBalancer = $EGWConfXML.edge.features.LoadBalancer $Holder.DHCP = $EGWConfXML.edge.features.DHCP Return $Holder } Enter the following command to import the function: Import-Module <path-to-psm1-file> Connect to VMware Cloud Director using the following commands, swapping the <user-name> and <org-id> with your credentials and the <api-url> with your region details (which is the API URL without the http:// part): $credential = Get-Credential -Message \"Enter your Cloud Director password?\" -UserName <user-name> $vcd = Connect-CIServer -Server <api-url> -Org <org-id> -Credential $credential Tip You can find your credentials and region information in the UKCloud Portal by clicking your username in the top right hand corner and selecting API. For more information, see Finding your Cloud Director API credentials . Make sure to use the Username rather than the API Username . Find your edge gateways by entering the following command: $Gateways = Search-Cloud -QueryType EdgeGateway Inspect the $Gateways variable and identify the edge for which you want to export configuration data. Retrieve the configuration data for your chosen edge. For example, to retrieve configuration data for the first edge in the $Gateways variable, enter the following command: $Config = Get-EdgeConfig -EdgeGateway $Gateways[0] Inspect the $Config variable. It will have the following properties: $Config.Firewall = All the firewall rules $Config.NAT = All the NAT rules $Config.LoadBalancer = All load balancer rules $Config.DHCP = All DHCP pools You can drill down further into the object's properties to retrieve more details. For example, using $Config.firewall[0].source , you can examine the source of the first retrieved firewall rule. Data such as source addresses is presented as objects in objects, so if you want to export the data to a CSV, we recommend first using code like that shown below to extract these values and present them at the top level. You could add these functions to your previously created .psm1 file and import them as before. function Get-FirewallDetails ($config) { foreach ($fwrule in $config.firewall){ $protocol = $fwrule.application.service.protocol $fwrule.SetAttribute(\"protocol\",$protocol) $port = $fwrule.application.service.port $fwrule.SetAttribute(\"port\",$port) $srcport = $fwrule.application.service.sourcePort $fwrule.SetAttribute(\"sourcePort\",$srcport) $destex = $fwrule.destination.exclude $fwrule.SetAttribute(\"destExclude\",$destex) $destip = $fwrule.destination.ipAddress $fwrule.SetAttribute(\"destIP\",$destip) $srcex = $fwrule.source.exclude $fwrule.SetAttribute(\"srcExclude\",$srcex) $srcip = $fwrule.source.ipAddress $fwrule.SetAttribute(\"srcIP\",$srcip) } } function Get-NatDetails ($config) { foreach ($natrule in $config.nat){ $Originalip = $natrule.GatewayNatRule.OriginalIP $Translatedip = $natrule.GatewayNatRule.TranslatedIP $appliedon = $natrule.GatewayNatRule.interface.name $OriginalPort = $natrule.GatewayNatRule.originalport $TranslatedPort = $natrule.GatewayNatRule.TranslatedPort $Protocol = $natrule.GatewayNatRule.Protocol $natrule.SetAttribute(\"OriginalIP\", $Originalip) $natrule.SetAttribute(\"TranslatedIP\", $Translatedip) $natrule.SetAttribute(\"AppliedOn\", $appliedon) $natrule.SetAttribute(\"OriginalPort\", $OriginalPort) $natrule.SetAttribute(\"TranslatedPort\", $TranslatedPort) $natrule.SetAttribute(\"Protocol\", $Protocol) } } You can then run Get-FirewallDetails $Config to make the results more export-friendly.

    "keywords": "How to upgrade your edge gateway Overview It's important to keep your edge gateways up to date to ensure that you benefit from the latest features and enhancements. This article shows you how to upgrade your edge gateway to the latest available version. If you need any assistance with the upgrade process, contact UKCloud Support by raising a Service Request in the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. Different types of edge VMware Cloud Director uses NSX edge services gateways in three main areas. These are all identical at the virtual network level, however feature exposure in VMware Cloud Director varies. Due to this, there are differences in the method to upgrade these underlying devices. Organisation edge gateways These are commonly referred to as edge gateways, and are by far the most widely understood. They provide VPN, NAT, firewall and routing functionality, and appear as the object Edge Gateway in VMware Cloud Director. These edges are referred to as edge gateways throughout this article. To upgrade an organisation edge gateway, see Upgrading an organisation edge gateway . Isolated organisation network edges When you create an isolated organisation network in a VDC in VMware Cloud Director, DHCP services are enabled by default with a DHCP pool of any remaining IP addresses not used by any static IP pools specified for the network. A small NSX edge services gateway is deployed on the network to manage DHCP traffic. If you disable the DHCP service after creation of the network, the edge is removed. To upgrade an isolated organisation network edge, see Upgrading an isolated network edge . vApp network edges vApps and vApp networks have some optional capabilities that require the use of an NSX edge services gateway in the underlying network. This is often due to the vApp being configured as \"fenced\", requiring you to use NAT to communicate outside of the vApp. If you've configured a vApp network with any of the following, an NSX edge services gateway is required: NAT Firewall DHCP Scope Connection into an organisation network To upgrade a vApp network edge, see Upgrading a vApp network edge . Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have access to the UKCloud Portal and VMware Cloud Director. Upgrading an edge to the latest available version Upgrading an organisation edge gateway Important Before you begin the upgrade process, bear in mind that this process requires downtime as a new VM needs to be deployed for the edge gateway. There will also be a brief network disruption for the networks that are used by the edge gateway instance. You should make sure that you have planned for this downtime before proceeding. To upgrade an organisation edge gateway you need to redeploy the edge: In the VMware Cloud Director Virtual Data Center dashboard, select the VDC that contains the edge gateway you want to upgrade. In the left navigation panel, under Networking select Edges . On the Edge Gateways page, select the edge that you want to configure and click Redeploy . In the Confirm Redeploy dialog box, click OK . Upgrading an isolated network edge To upgrade an isolated network edge, you need to reset the network. This forces a redeployment of the edge used for the DHCP service. Important Before you begin the upgrade process, bear in mind that this process will disrupt DHCP server operations whilst the underlying edge is redeployed. In the VMware Cloud Director Virtual Data Center dashboard, select the VDC that contains the network edge you want to upgrade. In the left navigation panel, select Networks . On the Networks page, select the isolated network that contains the edge you want to upgrade and click Reset . In the Reset Network dialog box, click OK . Upgrading a vApp network edge An edge will be present on your vApp network if the network is: Connected to an organisation network Configured for NAT and/or firewall services Configured to supply DHCP services (disabled by default) To upgrade a vApp network edge you can either reset the network or shut down the vApp and restart it. Resetting the network One way to upgrade a vApp network edge is to reset the vApp network. Important Before you begin the upgrade process, bear in mind that this process will disrupt any traffic flowing into or out of the vApp network and DHCP services will be interrupted. In the VMware Cloud Director Virtual Data Center dashboard, select the VDC that contains the vApp with the network edge you want to upgrade. In the left navigation panel, select vApps . On the vApps page, in the card for the vApp, click Details . On the vApp details page, select the Networks tab. Select the vApp network that contains the edge you want to upgrade and click Reset . In the Reset Network dialog box, click OK . Shutting down and restarting the vApp Another way to upgrade a vApp network is to shut down the vApp and restart it. Restarting the vApp in this way recreates any networks in the virtual network space and deploys fresh vApp edges with the configuration held in VMware Cloud Director. Important Before you begin the upgrade process, bear in mind that all the vApp resources will be unavailable until the vApp restarts. In the VMware Cloud Director Virtual Data Center dashboard, select the VDC that contains the vApp with the network edge you want to upgrade. In the left navigation panel, select vApps . On the vApps pages, in the card for the vApp, select Actions , then Power Off or Stop . Note You must shut down the vApp itself to trigger the deployment of fresh vApp edges; it is not enough to just power off all VMs inside the vApp. After the vApp has shut down, in the vApp card, select Actions then Power On . After the vApp has powered on, the vApp network edge will have been upgraded to the latest version.

    "keywords": "How to use affinity and anti‑affinity rules Overview Affinity and anti-affinity rules determine whether or not VMs are kept together as they are moved around within your environment. Affinity rules keep VMs together on the same host Anti-affinity rules ensure that VMs are distributed across different hosts For example, if it's important that your application has very low latency, you can create affinity rules to make sure that the application's VMs are always kept on the same host. If you want your application to be robust in the event of host failures, you can create anti-affinity rules to spread the VMs across multiple hosts. Important Excessive use of affinity and anti-affinity rules can cause unpredictable VM and platform performance issues. For example, VMs involved in rules may have an increased likelihood of migrating between hosts simultaneously. Adding a large number of VMs to an affinity rule may cause performance issues if all of the VMs become busy simultaneously. An anti-affinity rule with a large number of VMs may not be honoured if the platform is unable to place the VMs on separate hosts. UKCloud reserves the right to disable or disregard rules if required for maintenance or platform management.

    "title": "How to use the VMware OVF Tool",
    "keywords": "How to use the VMware OVF Tool Overview The VMware OVF Tool is a conversion program freely downloadable from VMware that assists in the distribution of virtual machines (VMs) and vApps, converting them between OVF, VMX and OVA formats. It also includes a command‑line facility to import and export OVF packages between environments or from third party suppliers. The OVF Tool is a command‑line interface (CLI) tool only. OVF (Open Virtualisation Format) is a packaging standard created by leading virtualisation vendors. It is a platform independent, efficient, open packaging and distribution format for VMs. VMX (the VM configuration file) is a simple text file with various parameters relating to the guest VM. The OVA file extension is associated with Open Virtual Machine Format. Compared to the OVF file format, the OVA format contains all VM files and *.ovf files compressed into one single OVA archive file instead of many files in a folder. Downloading the OVF Tool You can download the OVF Tool via the following link: https://my.vmware.com/group/vmware/get-download?downloadGroup=OVFTOOL430UPDATE3 You must have a VMware account to download the tool. You can download the OVF Tool for Windows 32-bit and 64-bit, Linux 32-bit and 64-bit, or Mac OS X. After downloading and installing the OVF Tool, you must then go to the directory in which you installed the tool to run it. There is no icon or program logo on your desktop for the OVF Tool, so to launch it, you must use the command prompt. Go to the installation folder and run: ovftool Getting started with the OVF Tool The OVF Tool is a CLI tool, so some level of familiarity with CMD commands helps in using the tool. There are a number of help commands, which are a good source of information: ovftool --help ovftool --help examples ovftool --help locators ovftool --help config You can also find the OVF Tool User Guide at: https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/ovf/ Basic import and export commands You'll mainly use the OVF Tool to import (deploy) and export VMs or appliances into and out of your UKCloud environment. The basic syntax to do this using the OVF Tool is: ovftool <source> <target> Refer to the OVF Tool User Guide for further commands and switches. Importing a .vmx file to a vApp template To import a .vmx file: In your UKCloud environment, create a catalog to contain the vApp template. For detailed instructions, see How to create a catalog . Make sure you are in the correct directory, that is, the directory containing the file you want to import. Run the following command: ovftool --vCloudTemplate --acceptAllEulas --overwrite <filename> \"vcloud://<username>@<apiURL>?org=<computeServiceID>&vappTemplate=<newTemplate>&catalog=<catalogID>\" Where: vCloudTemplate indicates that you're uploading a new vApp template acceptAllEulas indicates that you accept all end user licence agreements overwrite indicates that you're replacing an existing vApp with the new one being uploaded filename is the name of the .vmx file that are importing username is your UKCloud Portal user ID apiURL is your Cloud Director API URL. This URL is different depending on the region in which your environment is located. For more information, see How to access VMware Cloud Director through the Cloud Director API . computeServiceID is the ID of your UKCloud compute service (sometimes also called an org or vOrg) vappTemplate is the ID of the vApp template catalogID is the ID of the catalog in which the vApp template is located For example: ovftool --vCloudTemplate --acceptAllEulas --overwrite centos71.vmx \"vcloud://auser@api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com:443?org=1-2-3-a4b56c& vappTemplate=centos71&catalog=OVFTool-test\" Tip Make sure you use double quotes ( \" ) rather than single quotes ( ' ). The .vmx file is uploaded as a vApp template into your environment. In VMware Cloud Director, expand the Recent Tasks panel to check the status. Importing an .iso file to a vApp template To upload an ISO image: Make sure you are in the correct directory, that is, the directory containing the ISO file you want to import.

    "keywords": "How to view storage profile usage Overview Before allocating more disk space in your UKCloud for VMware account, it's useful to check how much of your allocated space has been used. Viewing a VDC's storage usage (Tenant Portal) In the VMware Cloud Director Tenant Portal, you can see how much storage a VDC is currently using. In the VMware Cloud Director Virtual Data Center dashboard, find the card for the VDC. The Storage section shows how much storage the VDC is currently using as well as the amount of allocated storage. Viewing a VM's storage usage (Tenant Portal) In the VMware Cloud Director Tenant Portal, you can see how much storage an individual VM is currently using. In the VMware Cloud Director Virtual Data Center dashboard, select the VDC that contains the VM. Find the card for the VM. The Storage section shows how much storage the VM is currently using. Viewing a VDC's storage usage (Cloud Director API) To check your storage profile usage programmatically, you need to call the appropriate Cloud Director REST API endpoint. Note Before calling this endpoint, you must first authenticate your session as described in How to access VMware Cloud Director through the Cloud Director API . We've provided some sample code to show how to make this call on our GitHub repository . The using_curl.md page provides an example of how to use CURL to call the REST API. The example assumes that you have set up the following three environment variables to hold your user credentials: VCD_ORG VCD_USERNAME VCD_PASSWORD The example makes two calls to the API. The first call authenticates the session: curl -u %VCD_USERNAME%@%VCD_ORG%:%VCD_PASSWORD% -H \"Accept: application/*+xml;version=5.6\" -X POST -i https://api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/sessions Tip On Linux, use $VCD_USERNAME instead of %VCD_USERNAME% . Having authenticated successfully and received an x-vcloud-authorisation header in the response, the second call passes the authentication token as a header on the request: curl -H \"x-vcloud-authorization: a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6\" -H \"Accept: application/*+xml;version=5.6\" -i https://api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/query?type=orgVdcStorageProfile This call returns an XML structure, in which you can see an OrgVdcStorageProfileRecord element containing the following properties: storageLimitMB=\"512000\" storageUsedMB=\"65536\" The GitHub repository also provides a ruby example. Again, the script assumes the above environment variables have been set up with your user credentials. You can use the ruby script by running: ruby storage_profile.rb The output will look similar to the following: Name Used GB Total GB Percent VDC BASIC-Any 192 500 38.5% XXXX Feedback If you find a problem with this article, click Improve this Doc to make the change yourself or raise an issue in GitHub.

    "keywords": "How to add products to the vCloud Usage Meter Overview The VMware Licence Service (VLS) enables you to switch to a flexible, VMware Cloud Provider Programme (VCPP) consumption-based licensing model. As the VLS licensing model is consumption-based, you must send reports to UKCloud each month to detail your usage of VMware products. To generate these monthly reports, you need to install the vCloud Usage Meter (Usage Meter) and give it access to the products that you need it to report on. This article provides all the information you need to add products to the Usage Meter. For more information about the Usage Meter, see the VMware documentation here . Prerequisites You must have installed and configured the vCloud Usage Meter. For more information, see How to install the vCloud Usage Meter . Adding products to the Usage Meter To collect VMware product usage information for your UKCloud environment, you must add each product that you want to be monitored to the Usage Meter. For each product server that you add, the Usage Meter might present a certificate that you can verify, which you'll need to accept before proceeding. The instructions below show how to enable monitoring for some of the base VMware products. For instructions for additional products, see the VMware documentation here . Adding a vCenter Server to the Usage Meter You can add one or more vCenter Server instances to the Usage Meter. Creating a role for the Usage Meter Before you can add a vCenter Server to the Usage Meter, you need to create a new role with the correct read only permission: In vCenter, navigate to Administration > Roles , then click the Create role button. Enter Role name , for example, usagemeter_RO . Select the Profile-driven storage > Profile-driven storage view permission and click OK . Navigate to Administration > Users and Groups . Create a new local user, for example, usagemeter and record the password. Navigate to Hosts and Clusters and select the root server object. Select Permissions and click the Add button. Enter the user and role created in these steps and select Propagate to children , then click OK . Adding a vCenter Server To monitor vCenter Servers using the Usage Meter, verify that you have the host name and credentials for the vCenter Server you're adding. Note If you're using VMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM), add the recovery site vCenter before adding the protected site vCenter. The Usage Meter performs collections against all added vCenter Server instances and SRM instances in both the protected and recovery sites. To add a vCenter Server to the Usage Meter: Log in to the Usage Meter web application. In the top-right menu, select Manage , then select the Products tab. In the vCenter Server section, click the Add button. In the vCenter Server dialog box, if you're using an external Platform Services Controller (PSC), select the External Platform Services Controller check box and enter the external PSC host name and port (the default port for PSC is 7444 ).

After you accept any required certificates, the NSX Manager instance is added to the list of NSX Manager instances. If an error occurs, you'll see a message and the server instance will not be added. Note After successfully adding the NSX Manager instance, if you enter an incorrect password when editing it, the NSX Manager will be deleted. To reactivate it, provide the correct credentials. Adding vRealize Operations Manager to the Usage Meter To monitor vRealize Operations Manager (vROps) instances using the Usage Meter, vROps has to be registered correctly against a vCenter Server. During discovery of a vCenter Server, the Usage Meter will populate a vROps entry. To complete the vROps registration and begin metering, you need to provide the required credentials for each vROps instance you meter. Note To prevent metering issues with vROps, ensure vROps, vCenter and the Usage Meter are all using the same time zone. To complete vROps registration: In the top-right menu of the Usage Meter web application, select Manage , then select the Products tab. In the vRealize Operations Manager section, click Edit and enter the user name and password. If you're logging in with a local user, use the local user-name . If you're logging in with a non-local user, the user name must be in the following format: user-name@domain-name@domain-alias , where the domain-alias is the domain short name or domain alias. To add vRealize Operations Manager, accept the certificate. If you miss accepting the certificate, delete the vCenter Server associated with that vRealize Operations Manager and then reactivate it. Click Save . Checking the monitoring status When you've finished adding all of your metered products and the collection time has been reached, you can check the monitoring status to ensure that the Usage Meter is monitoring products correctly. In the top-right menu of the Usage Meter web application, select Monitor . Against each day, you can see the times of successful and failed collections. If collections are failing, hover the mouse over the failure times to display which product is failing collections. If you're unable to diagnose the cause of the failures, you can use the Support option from the menu bar to generate a log bundle and then raise a ticket in My Calls and attach the log for investigation. Setting licence packs When you've completed the addition of VMware products to the Usage Meter and it has performed a discovery of the environment, you need to configure the discovered VLS licences to the correct billing category. In the top-right menu of the Usage Meter web application, select Licenses . On the Billing Categories tab, against each discovered UKCloud-provided licence, from the Billing Category list, select VCPP . For any old licences that were not supplied by UKCloud under VLS, select Perpetual . Next steps This article described how to give the Usage Meter access to the products that you need it to report on. Next, you need to send monthly usage reports to UKCloud so that you can be billed correctly for the VMware Licence Service.

    "title": "How to create a virtual protection group",
    "keywords": "How to create a virtual protection group Overview A virtual protection group (VPG) is a collection of virtual machines (VMs) that are grouped together for some purpose, for example data protection, disaster recovery or workload migration. When you create a VPG, a replica virtual disk is created on the target site (for recovery or migration) for each VM in the VPG. These replica disks are then populated with the data in the source VMs by synchronising the VMs with the target site replicas. After the initial synchronisation completes, any writes to disk from the VMs in the source site are sent to the target site. These writes are stored in the target site in journals. Intended audience This guide is intended for users who are: Setting up Disaster Recovery as a Service Setting up Journaling Protection Migrating workloads onto the UKCloud platform For Journaling Protection, you must have access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal in the UKCloud zone in which the VMs that you want to protect are located. For Disaster Recovery as a Service or Migration to the Cloud, you must have access to the Zerto Virtual Manager Web Client in the local environment in which the VMs that you want to protect or migrate are located. Creating a virtual protection group in the Zerto Self-Service Portal (Journaling Protection) To create a VPG for Journaling Protection, use the Zerto Self-Service Portal. You must first create the initial VPG to specify the vApp to protect and the recovery site to use. After the initial creation, you can then edit the VPG to specify what happens during the recovery process. Creating a virtual protection group If you're creating a VPG for Journaling Protection, you specify the vApp to protect and all the VMs in that vApp are included in the VPG. Log in to the ZSSP . Use the ZSSP login link for the zone in which the VMs that you want to protect are located. Select the VPGs tab and then click New VPG . In the Create VPG dialog, specify the VPG Name . The name must be unique and contain no more than 80 characters. Select the vApp that contains the VMs that you want to protect. From the Recovery Site list, select your target site. From the Org vDC list, select the VDC in which you want to replicate the VMs. From the Service Profile list, select one of the Journaling Protection service profiles, depending on the level of retention you require: Journaling Protection 2 Day Retention Journaling Protection 7 Day Retention System Service Profile (for 14-day Journaling Protection) If your environment is in the Elevated OFFICIAL security domain, the service profile to use for 14-day Journaling Protection is called UKCloud Service Profile. Journaling Protection 28 Day Retention Click Save . At this point, the selected VMs are synchronised to the target site. This synchronisation between the source site and target site may take some time, depending on the size of the VMs. After the initial synchronisation, all the VMs in the VPG are fully protected and all write operations to those VMs are sent to the journal. Editing virtual protection group properties After the initial creation of your VPG, you need to edit it to determine what happens during recovery. In the VPGs tab of the Zerto Self-Service Portal, select your VPG then click the three dots. Select Edit VPG On the General page of the Edit VPG dialog box, from the Priority list, choose the priority of transferring data from the source site to the target site for this VPG when there is limited bandwidth and more than one VPG is defined on the source site. High - Updates from VPGs with high priority are passed over the WAN first Medium - Updates from VPGs with medium priority use whatever bandwidth is left after the high priority VPGs have used it Low - Updates from VPGs with low priority use whatever bandwidth is left after the medium VPGs have used it Click Next . On the VMs page, you can see the VMs that are included in the VPG. Click Next . On the Replication page, you can see the options you selected for the Recovery Site and Recovery Org vDC . To change the Storage Profile used for the VMs in the VPG, click VM Settings . You cannot change the Journal Hard Limit or Journal Warning Threshold . When you're done, click OK then click Next . The Storage page displays the storage used for the VM data (by default, this is the same storage as that used for the VM definition). If you want to edit the storage settings for a VM, select the VM and then click Edit Selected . Note Make sure that the Thin checkbox is selected for all VMs. When you've finished setting the options for each of the VMs, click Next . On the Recovery page, from the Failover/Move Network list, choose the network to use in the target site for a live failover. From the Failover Test Network list, choose the network to use in the target site for a test failover of VMs. If you select Isolated , the network interface controller (NIC) will not be connected to the VM when it's brought up in the target site. vCD Guest Customization controls whether the failed‑over VM is subject to guest customization to set its IP address inside its operating system. Click Next . On the NICs page, specify the network interface controller (NIC) to use for the VMs after a live or test failover. Note If you specify different IP addresses (or use IP Pool ) for the IP addresses here, you must enable vCD Guest Customization on the Recovery page. Click Next . The UKCloud service profiles do not permit Long Term Retention Services, so click Next again. On the Summary page, review the options you've selected for the VPG and click Done to create the VPG. Creating a virtual protection group in Zerto Virtual Manager (Disaster Recovery as a Service and Migration to the Cloud) If you're creating a VPG for Disaster Recovery as a Service or Migration to the Cloud, use the ZVM Web Client in your local environment.

    "title": "How to perform a failover",
    "keywords": "How to perform a failover Overview You may want to perform a failover in the following circumstances: To recover virtual machines (VMs) after an issue or disaster, if you're using Disaster Recovery as a Service or the UKCloud for VMware Journaling Protection option To migrate workloads from a local, on-premises environment onto the UKCloud platform With Disaster Recovery as a Service and Journaling Protection, you can also run a test failover to verify that, during recovery, your protected VMs are correctly replicated at the target site. Important During the failover process, any change in the configuration or state of the live or failed‑over VMs (for example, power on or power off) will cause failure of the failover and may corrupt the VPG. This could make a full resync necessary and, in a disaster recovery situation, could prevent failover completely. Intended audience To perform the steps in this guide you need access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal (ZSSP) in either the source or target zone. Running a test failover If you use Disaster Recovery as a Service or Journaling Protection, you should periodically run test failovers to verify that, in the case of a live failover, your VMs can be recovered successfully. When you run a test failover, a test VM is created for each of your protected VMs in a sandbox on the target site, using the test network specified in the virtual protection group (VPG). During the test, your VMs' journals continue to be updated and new checkpoints generated, ensuring that your VMs remain protected and can be fully recovered in the event of an actual live failover. Note When the test failover has been instantiated, Zerto will automatically start up the test failover VMs. It is critically important that you do not power on (or power off) the VMs manually in VMware Cloud Director before the failover is completely instantiated. Changing the state of the VMs in VMware Cloud Director before the failover process is complete will result in corruption of the VPG. If you power off failed-over VMs while a test failover is in progress, replication of live VMs will be affected. Log in to the ZSSP . Use the ZSSP login link for the zone in which your target VDC is located. At the bottom of the page, select Failover , then Test . In the Failover Test wizard, on the Select VPGs page, select one or more VPGs that you want to test then click Next . The Execute Parameters page shows the most recent checkpoint added to the journal. If you want to use a different checkpoint for the test, click the Checkpoint time. In the Checkpoints dialog box, select the checkpoint that you want to use: Latest to use the latest checkpoint Latest Tagged Checkpoint to use the latest manually added checkpoint Latest VSS Checkpoint to use the latest VSS snapshot (this option is applicable only for Disaster Recovery as a Service and if you've installed the Zerto VSS agent on the VM) Select from all available checkpoints to select a specific checkpoint from the list below Click OK then click Next . In the Failover Test page, review the diagram to see the number of VPGs and VMs included in the test and where they will be recovered to, then click Start Failover Test . The test begins with an initialisation period, during which the VMs are created in scratch volumes on the target site. You can check the status of the test by clicking the VPG Name on the VPGs tab. To stop the test, on the VPGs tab, click the VPG Name and click the Stop test icon. In the Stop Test dialog, from the Result list, choose whether the test succeeded or failed, then click Stop . You can also provide additional Notes to describe the test scenario. After you stop the test, the test VMs are powered off and removed. Running a live failover In the event of a disaster, you'll need to run a live failover to recover your VMs. You can also use live failover to migrate your workloads to the target site. Note When the failover has been instantiated, Zerto will automatically start up the failover VMs. It is critically important that you do not power on (or power off) the VMs manually in VMware Cloud Director before the failover is completely instantiated. Changing the state of the VMs in VMware Cloud Director before the failover process is complete will result in corruption of the VPG and potentially the failure of the disaster recovery process. Log in to the ZSSP . Use the ZSSP login link for the zone in which your target VDC (for recovery or migration) is located. At the bottom of the page, select Failover , then Live . In the Failover Live wizard, on the Select VPGs page, select one or more VPGs that you want to failover or migrate then click Next . The Execute Parameters page shows the most recent checkpoint added to the journal. If you want to use a different checkpoint, click the Checkpoint time. In the Checkpoints dialog, select the checkpoint that you want to use: Latest to use the latest checkpoint Latest Tagged Checkpoint to use the latest manually added checkpoint Latest VSS Checkpoint to use the latest VSS snapshot (this option is applicable only for Disaster Recovery as a Service and Migration to the Cloud, and if you've installed the Zerto VSS agent on the VM) Select from all available checkpoints to select a specific checkpoint from the list below Click OK . The commit policy gives you the opportunity to check the integrity of the recovered or migrated VMs before committing the failover. To change the commit policy, click the Commit Policy field and select: Auto-Commit if you want to automatically commit the failover after a specified amount of time if there is no user interaction. Set the amount of time in the After field, up to a maximum of 1440 minutes (24 hours). If you want the failover to be immediately committed, enter 0. Auto-Rollback if you want to automatically roll back the failover after a specified amount of time if there is no user interaction. Set the amount of time in the After field, up to a maximum of 1440 minutes (24 hours). If you want the failover to be immediately rolled back, enter 0. None if you do not want to apply a commit policy. You must manually commit or roll back the failover. The VM shutdown policy determines what happens to the source VMs in the event of a failover. To change the shutdown policy, click the VM Shutdown field and select: No to leave the source VMs as they are before starting the failover. Yes if the source VMs have VMware Tools available so that they can be gracefully shut down before starting the failover or migration. If the VMs cannot be shut down, the failover fails. Force Shutdown to forcibly shut down the source VMs before starting the failover. Reverse protection ensures that when the source VMs are failed over to the target site, the source site becomes the new target site so that the VMs are still protected. To enable reverse protection, click the Reverse Protection field and select the check box. Important Reverse protection uses the original source VM's virtual disks to pre‑seed the reverse replication, therefore enabling reverse protection will make changes to the source VMs. Click Next . In the Failover page, review the diagram to see the number of VPGs and VMs included in the failover and where they will be recovered or migrated to, then click Start Failover . The failover process creates the VMs in the target site to the selected point in time. Note If a VM already exists on the target site with the same name as one of the source VMs, a number is added to the end of the recovered or migrated VM name to ensure that it's unique. If you set a commit policy with a time greater than zero, you can check the integrity of the recovered or migrated VMs before committing (or rolling back) the failover. When you've finished testing, you can either wait for the time to elapse before the auto‑commit or auto‑rollback, or on the VPGs tab, click the VPG Name and then click the Commit or Rollback icon as required. Note As soon as a live failover is committed, the journal is destroyed and you cannot go back and select a different checkpoint. However, provided reverse protection is not enabled, the original VMs on the source site remain in place. When the commit is completed, the VPG will show as being in Needs Configuration state. When in this state, editing the VPG configuration may cause reverse protection to begin. If this is not desired, then you should delete the VPG as soon as it reaches the Needs Configuration state. Next steps Your VMs are now running in the target site, which is now your primary site. For Disaster Recovery as a Service and Journaling Protection, to return to the source site (or a different site) after the disaster has been resolved, perform a failover to move them to the source site. For Migration to the Cloud, as soon as you are happy with how your workloads are running on the UKCloud platform, you can tidy up the source environment.

A good use case for this method is for utilising like for like copies of production for pre-production environments. To perform the cloning efficiently, you need to use a PowerCLI script. This article guides you through the scripts required to automate the process of cloning, as well as removing the cloned vApp once it's no longer required. You can plug the PowerCLI scripts into various different configuration tools, such as Puppet or Chef, and also integrate them into orchestration tools, such as Jenkins and Ansible. Script to clone vApps We've provided an example of a PowerCLI script to clone and remove a vApp on UKCloud's GitHub repository: https://github.com/ukcloud/knowledge_centre/tree/master/CloningvAPPsUsingPowerCLI The example script clones the specified vApp into an existing catalogue within the appropriate VDC. The script also provides an option for deployment once it has cloned the vApp. If you select this option, the script deploys the vApp. Stop and remove vApp using PowerCLI When you no longer require the cloned vApp, there's a remove PowerCLI script that provides an automated way of removing the cloned environment. This script stops the vApp and then deletes it from the catalogue specified. Execute the scripts using VMware vSphere PowerCLI. VMware vSphere PowerCLI is a command-line interface (CLI) tool for automating vSphere and vCloud management.

    "keywords": "Comparison of UKCloud for VMware against hyperscalers Overview UKCloud has long been known for its VMware powered cloud that has enabled hundreds of UK public sector workloads to be moved to the cloud. Since the launch of this service, we've made significant investments and numerous innovations in the physical infrastructure, software implementation and the manner in which VMware is utilised. The service that's available today has been vastly improved in terms of reliability, functionality and performance. Although there are several cloud providers available to the UK public sector, UKCloud maintains its position as the number one choice for security-assured, citizen-facing services with UK data centres and UK-based security cleared staff. There are several factors to consider when choosing a cloud provider, such as price, performance, reliability, suitability for workloads, sovereignty and assurance. Value for money will often be at the forefront of the decision-making process. However, at UKCloud we are competitive on more than just price and believe performance is an important metric to consider. This article concentrates on performance benchmarking and introduces a comparison of performance on our VMware platform against other public cloud providers. Why does performance matter? These results are important for several reasons: Cost control – The superior performance of the UKCloud platform means that you can do more with less. To match our performance using the public cloud providers, you would need bigger instances, more instances or both – significantly increasing the cost of those platforms. A platform that appears 20% cheaper but has half the performance may mean you end up paying 60% more for the same performance. Business productivity – UKCloud for VMware has been designed specifically for customers transitioning their legacy workloads to the cloud. The majority of legacy applications are running in virtualised environments using VMware and hence can be moved quickly, with less risk, and yet immediately benefit from the elasticity and scalability of the cloud. Superior performance means that you can achieve greater operational efficiency on our platform. User experience – As digital systems are increasingly used by millions of users (for example, citizens), it's important that your platform can deliver superior performance when your users need it. Our approach to benchmarking To validate the performance of our platform, UKCloud has been running automated tests to compare the performance of UKCloud for VMware against two leading proprietary public cloud platforms: Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. The benchmarking was based on the PerfKit Benchmarker tool which was originally developed by Google and made available to the open source community. PerfKit is designed to provide a repeatable, consistent and open way of measuring cloud performance. PerfKit was configured to specifically compare UKCloud for VMware in Region 6, Zone F with AWS EU-West 2 (London) region and the Azure London region. The benchmarks ran throughout August 2017 and average values for the month are reported below. UKCloud have worked on extending Perfkit to directly support VMware Cloud Director-based clouds, this is available from the UKCloud Github pages and will be contributed back to the core repository. This will enable you to run your own benchmarks with up-to-date data, allowing for a ready comparison of our performance against other public cloud providers. You will also be able to compare performance from a set time period of your choice. Benchmark results UKCloud performed a suite of tests to assess the performance of various components of the platform, as well as some end-to-end system tests. The rest of this article provides more detail regarding each of the benchmark results. Note For the graphs shown in this article, a higher result indicates superior performance (UKCloud outperforms AWS on 80% of the benchmarks performed and Azure on 100%). Networking performance The networking performance test is a commonly used benchmark that can create TCP and UDP data streams and measure the throughput of a network that is carrying them. The values shown in the graph below indicate the maximum throughput of the respective networks. UKCloud has a maximum throughput almost 4 times higher than that of AWS and over 6 times higher than Azure. This is important for customers who are moving large sets of data or need quick access to their data over the network. This results in less time spent waiting for data transfers to be completed, which allows applications to access their data more quickly, meaning applications are able to run faster, giving a better user experience. MongoDB (NoSQL) overall performance* MongoDB is an open-source database developed by MongoDB, Inc. Unlike relational databases, it stores data in JSON format that can vary in structure. This data model gives you the ability to represent hierarchical relationships and other complex structures easily. MongoDB was designed with high availability and scalability and therefore includes out-of-the-box replication and auto-scaling. The performance of MongoDB running on UKCloud for VMware is almost 2 times faster than both AWS and Azure meaning that MongoDB performs almost twice as many operations per second on the UKCloud platform. This results in better database performance and means there is higher data availability to applications, which in turn affects the service that a customer consumes, resulting in a better customer experience. * Test performed with 32 threads and a combination of operation types. Redis Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure used as a database, cache and message broker. Supported data structures include strings, hashes, lists, sets, stored sets, bitmaps, hyperloglogs and geospatial indexes. The outstanding performance of Redis is achieved through an in-memory dataset. Depending on what you use RDB (Redis) for, you can benefit from on-disk persistence by dumping the dataset to disk or appending each command to a log. RDB (Redis) running on UKCloud is 2 times faster than AWS and almost 2 times faster than Azure, meaning that Redis can perform twice as many requests per second on our platform. This results in better caching and message throughput which means that smaller clusters of data are required for the same workload. This also means that fewer VMs are required for the workload, therefore saving the user money. Random IO performance Random read is a measure of how quickly multiple small files can be read from random areas on a disk. Random read performance is measured in input-output operations per second with the number shown below an indication of the maximum number of reads. Random write uses the same disk pattern as random read but data is written to the disk rather than read. The graph below shows that the UKCloud platform performs 2.5 times faster random read IOPs than AWS and over 15 times faster than Azure. For random write, the UKCloud platform performs 9 times more IOPs than AWS and almost 61 times more than Azure. This means that enterprise applications such as relational databases which are disk-intensive (require high I/O), perform better on the UKCloud platform. Databases and applications that are disk intensive are often slowed down by their storage, hence the increased popularity of Solid State Drives (SSD). However, as the graph below shows, UKCloud provides fast storage access allowing applications to rapidly access and process data, resulting in faster applications compared to AWS and Azure's equivalent storage option. Sequential IO performance (IOPS) Sequential read is a disk access pattern where large continuous blocks of data are read from adjacent locations on the disk. Sequential write is the same pattern, but data is written to the disk rather than read. These kinds of disk access patterns are common when accessing large multimedia files such as music, video and images. They are also important for data warehouses and analytics applications. The graph below shows that for sequential read the UKCloud platform performs 8 times better than AWS and almost 4 times better than Azure. For sequential write, the UKCloud platform has a maximum IO over 3 times higher than AWS and 2 times higher than Azure. As with databases, these kinds of applications are often slowed down by their storage, hence the increased popularity of solid state drives (SSD). However, as the graph below shows, UKCloud provides fast storage access allowing applications to rapidly access and process data, resulting in faster applications compared to AWS and Azure's equivalent storage option. High sequential IO performance is vital for data analysis and specifically for data warehouses which are a core component of business intelligence and thus guide key management decisions. Where does UKCloud for VMware outperform public cloud providers? These results show that UKCloud for VMware consistently outperforms both AWS and Azure across a variety of benchmarks; (UKCloud outperforms AWS on 80% of the benchmarks performed and Azure on 100%). Networking performance Almost 4 times higher than AWS Over 6 times higher than Azure Users spend less time transferring data on the network, allowing applications to access their data faster and thus running faster also MongoDB performance 2 times faster than AWS and Azure Better database performance allows for higher data availability to applications, therefore resulting in a better customer experience Redis performance 2 times faster than AWS Almost 2 times faster than Azure Smaller clusters of data are required for the same workload – this means fewer VMs are required and therefore saves you money Random I/O performance Random Read is 2.5 times faster than AWS and over 15 times faster than Azure Random Write is 9 times faster than AWS and almost 61 times faster than Azure Faster storage access allows applications to rapidly access and process data and thus results in faster applications Sequential I/O performance Sequential Read is 8 times better than AWS and almost 4 times better than Azure Sequential Write is over 3 times higher than AWS and 2 times higher than Azure High sequential IO performance is vital for data analysis and specifically for data warehouses, it is a core component of business intelligence and thus guides key management decisions Summary The data summarised in this article demonstrates that UKCloud not only competes with leading public cloud providers on price but also offers superior performance on our VMware platform. Using UKCloud for VMware means that you can do more for less as you can save money with simple usage-based billing and benefit from the greater performance the platform offers. Although a platform may appear cheaper, if it has half the performance this may mean you could end up paying significantly more for the same performance. Although actual performance may vary based upon numerous real-world factors such as internet latency, application-tuning and a low risk of multi-tenant contention, we are confident that these benchmark results truly reflect the greater performance that UKCloud for VMware delivers over the nearest equivalent region and VM sizes of both AWS and Azure. We are continuously investigating ways to improve the performance of our VMware cloud through using the latest versions of VMware, software-defined storage and networking, coupled with adaptive storage and network tuning as the platform is consumed. All of this will reassure our customers that the greater performance delivered today, will remain in the future.

    "title": "Understanding connectivity options in UKCloud for VMware",
    "keywords": "Understanding connectivity options in UKCloud for VMware Introduction In UKCloud for VMware, UKCloud uses two different architecture designs. You can see this when you deploy virtual data centres (VDCs) onto our IaaS offering. Depending on the type of application you're running, you may see one or both types of network architecture when you deploy your solutions onto the UKCloud platform. This document explains what the different architectures look like so you can design your solutions to make the best use of them. Overview of UKCloud for VMware network architecture Our UKCloud for VMware service uses multiple security domains (Assured, Elevated and the Cross Domain Security Zone), enabling you to provide a service over the internet, government community networks (such as HSCN, PSN or Janet) or your own HybridConnect lines. Each of these networks brings its own challenges for network separation and prevention of accidental bridging. Our network architecture offers two different options to address these challenges. Your Cloud Architect will be able to advise you which solution works best for your application. Network Firewall Tenant (NFT) - NFTs are either single- or multi-tenant instances on Network Firewalls (NFWs), depending on the network that the VDC is connected to. NFWs share an external network connectivity layer connected to the government community network. NFT architecture is used in regions 1, 2, 7 and 8. Cloud Fabric and gateway - There are no NFTs on shared firewalls, instead we use a shared Cloud Fabric and the separation of connection types is done at the edge level. Cloud Fabric and gateway architecture is used in regions 5 and 6. NFT network architecture With our NFT network architecture, we use a slightly different design, depending on the network you are connecting to. If you've already used UKCloud IaaS then you'll probably already be familiar with the way the NFT architecture presents itself. Single network architecture (internet) All VDCs on the Assured security domain have outbound connectivity to the internet. When connecting a VDC to the internet (and no other network), we use the architecture shown the diagram below. You can see that Customer 1 has two VDCs, each of which has its own edge connected to the same NFT. Customer 1 and Customer 2 have separate NFTs on the same multi‑tenant NFW, which is on the shared internet facing network. From a customer management experience, you manage all your connectivity rules, such as firewall, IPsec VPN and NAT functionality, through your edge, using either the UKCloud Portal GUI or API. We manage the NFW and provide additional controls around whitelisted ports, metering and packet shaping. Multiple network architecture (PSN and HSCN) If you want to add other networks to your VDC (for example, HSCN or PSN), you can enable these connections through the same edge as your internet connection. This is possible because the separation of connectivity happens at the NFT. The NFT resides on a single tenant NFW to comply with the security requirements of these networks. In the diagram above, you can see that Customer 3 uses the same edge to connect to both the internet and HSCN through an NFT on a single tenant NFW. Customer 4 uses a similar architecture to connect to the internet and PSN. Management-wise, you can see the external IP range on the edge. Typically, you use this range for internet connectivity. However, in the case of PSN and HSCN, we translate the address on the NFW before routing it to the edge. You won't see your PSN or HSCN address in your IP allocation, but your users will need to target the address to reach your service. PSN If you're adding PSN connectivity to a VDC, we translate each PSN IP address to one of your external IP allocations, consuming one of your internet IPs. HSCN If you're adding HSCN connectivity to a VDC, we translate the HSCN IP to one of the following: One of your external IP allocations, consuming an internet IP. A private address of your choice, bypassing the edge and enabling you to route the traffic directly to a virtual machine (VM) with the same private address. This retains your external IP allocation but limits the use of your HSCN IP address. Multiple network architecture (Janet) If you want to connect to the Janet network, the network architecture is slightly different to that of other government community networks. As Janet is a new network in the UKCloud portfolio, we're able to leverage the changes to network connectivity in UKCloud for VMware. This means we can utilise the Cloud Fabric and Gateway model to present the Janet connection. In the diagram above, you can see two edges on the VDC: one presents the internet connectivity, and the other presents the Janet connectivity. The Janet-facing edge connects into the Janet Cloud Fabric and then out to the Janet network via the UKCloud managed gateway. The Janet facing edge has the same functionality as the internet facing edge and you can see your Janet IP address in the IP allocations on the edge. You manage the internet facing and Janet facing edges separately through the UKCloud Portal GUI or API. Networking in the Elevated security domain Networking in the Elevated security domain is very similar to the Assured security domain. All connectivity is routed through the same edge on the VDC, and separation of connections occurs within the NFT. PSN In the diagram above, Customer 1's PSN connection is routed to their NFT sitting in the multi-tenant NFW. This then provides the onward connection to Customer 1's edge. The same NFT also handles the connections in from Cross Domain Security Zone products (Walled Garden and SRA). Note UKCloud translates the PSN IP address to one of the external IP ranges that are available on the edge. Your users will target the PSN IP address, however you'll see only your UKCloud allocated external range on your edge, so it's important to know what your PSN IP has been translated to. RLI The RLI is also available in the Elevated security domain, however it is not natively connected to the UKCloud platform. This means that, to facilitate a connection to the RLI, you must go through the assurance process provided by the MOD to gain access to the RLI; only then can we complete the connection between the RLI and your VDC. The NFT for RLI sits in a single tenant NFW in line with MOD connection compliance. Networking between VDCs You have three options when networking between VDCs. Each option has a slightly different use case. Option 1: Shared networks Shared networks are useful when you have multiple VDCs within the same organisation boundary (sometimes referred to as a vOrg). You can create networks that span VDCs, enabling VMs within different VDCs to communicate with each other. This is particularly useful if you have VDCs with VMs that are operating at different service levels (ESSENTIAL, POWER and PRIORITY) and need to have inter-VM communication. Option 2: IPsec VPN If you need VDC communication between VDCs that reside either in different regions, vOrgs or even in external data centres, then you should use IPsec VPN tunnels. You can configure these on the edges of the VDCs that you are connecting. It's worth noting that you should configure the IPsec tunnels using your external IP address allocation, in both the Assured and Elevated security domains. In the Assured security domain, each IPsec tunnel consumes an external (internet) IP. Option 3: Static routes If the VDCs you're connecting reside on the same NFT, use static routes as an alternative to a shared network where you want more control of traffic between VMs. As traffic must traverse the edge, you can put in extra rules around connectivity to lock down communication between VMs in different VDCs. This enables you to construct DMZs or separate out services to different users while continuing to communicate between your VMs. Bringing your own firewall In most circumstances, the UKCloud provided edge will work for your solution. However, if your solution requires next generation firewall functionality, such as malware detection, antivirus protection, URL filtering or complex load balancing, you can provide your own firewall solution. Important If you choose to bring your own firewall, you're completely responsible for the deployment, configuration and management of that firewall. If you plan to deploy a firewall into a new VDC, let us know and we'll provision you a VDC with a dedicated network for you to deploy your firewall onto. If you change from a UKCloud‑provided firewall to your own firewall, we'll redeploy your firewall on to a dedicated network and you'll need to migrate your environment to that network. IP address allocations When you create a new vOrg, we'll provide you with a number of usable IP addresses per project, depending on the network you're connecting to: Internet - 5 x usable IPs HSCN - 1 x usable IP PSN - 1 x usable IP Janet - 1 x usable IP You can request additional IP addresses, as required, by raising a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. If you ask for a large number of IP addresses in a single request, we may ask you to provide further information to support your request. Cloud Fabric and gateway architecture The Cloud Fabric architecture utilises multi-tenant networks connected to UKCloud-managed gateways that provide external network connectivity to internet and government networks. The customer-managed edges are connected to the multi-tenant network and enable you to control firewall settings such as NAT, VPN and load balancing. There are no NFTs in the Cloud Fabric architecture so all the firewall settings are controlled by the edge VM. Single network architecture The diagram below shows how VDCs connected to a single network look using our new Cloud Fabric and gateway architecture. You can see that there is no NFT layer; instead each customer VDC has an edge that is connected directly into the multi‑tenant Cloud Fabric. This is then connected to a UKCloud‑managed gateway with onward connection to the internet. From a customer management experience, you manage all your connectivity rules, such as firewall, IPsec VPN and NAT functionality, through your edge, using either the UKCloud Portal GUI or API. UKCloud controls the gateway out to the internet and provides metering and packet shaping, however you're in full control of ports. Multiple network architecture Most differences between NFT and Cloud Fabric can be seen with multiple network architectures. To achieve network separation and ensure security and compliance with government community networks, we've developed a new VDC edge architecture. In the diagram above, you can see that if you want to add other networks to your VDC (for example, HSCN, PSN or Janet), you need separate edges to facilitate that connection. These edges have the same style of connectivity as the internet facing edge: an edge that connects into a Cloud Fabric, dedicated to that particular network, which then has onward connectivity to the government community network through the UKCloud‑managed gateway. Customer management is on a per-edge basis. You'll see multiple edges within your UKCloud Portal GUI and you'll need to manage these individually. The full functionality of each edge is available for every network connectivity, however UKCloud manages the port whitelist for all government connected networks. Network architecture for the Elevated security domain Networking in the Elevated security domain is the same as the Assured security domain from a management perspective. Just like the Assured security domain, there is edge separation for the different networks that feed into the Elevated security domain. As the diagram above shows, the edge is connected to a Cloud Fabric with onward connectivity to the PSN. There is also an internal Cloud Fabric that connects the Elevated VDC to the Walled Garden, enabling cross-security domain communication. Networking between VDCs You have two options for communicating between VDCs. Both these options will be familiar if you already use our platform, but if you're used to using static routes, you'll need to use one of the two options below instead for all inter-VDC communication. Option 1: Shared networks Shared networks are useful when you have multiple VDCs within the same vOrg and region. You can create networks that span between VDCs, enabling VMs within different VDCs to communicate. This is particularly useful if you have VDCs with VMs that are operating at different service levels (ESSENTIAL, POWER and PRIORITY) and need to have inter-VM communication. Option 2: IPsec VPN If you need VDC communication between VDCs that reside either in different regions, vOrgs or even in external data centres, then you should use IPsec VPN tunnels. You can configure these on the edges of the VDCs that you are connecting. It's worth noting that you should configure the IPsec tunnels using your external IP address allocation, in both the Assured and Elevated security domains. In the Assured security domain, each IPsec tunnel consumes an external (internet) IP. In the Elevated security domain each IPsec tunnel consumes either: An external (UKCloud) IP, if the tunnel is configured between VDCs An external (PSN) IP, if the tunnel is configured between a VDC and an endpoint on the PSN network Bringing your own firewall In most circumstances, the UKCloud‑provided edge will work for your solution. However, if your solution requires next generation firewall functionality, such as malware detection, antivirus protection, URL filtering or complex load balancing, you can provide your own firewall solution. Important If you choose to bring your own firewall, you're completely responsible for the deployment, configuration and management of that firewall. If you plan to deploy a firewall into a new VDC, let us know and we'll provision you a VDC with a dedicated network for you to deploy your firewall onto. If you change from a UKCloud‑provided firewall to your own firewall, we'll redeploy your firewall on to a dedicated network and you'll need to migrate your environment to that network. IP address allocation The number of public IP addresses we provide depends on whether you are using a UKCloud‑provided firewall or bringing your own: UKCloud provided firewall - If you're using a UKCloud‑provided firewall, we'll allocate you a single usable IP per VDC edge. You can request additional IP addresses as required by raising a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. If you ask for a large number of IP addresses in a single request, we may ask you to provide further information to support your request. BYOF - If you're using your own firewall technology, when you provision your VDC, we initially allocate you five public IP addresses. After this initial allocation, you can request more IP addresses by opening a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. Maintaining compliance with multiple networks When connecting to the different UKCloud networks it's important to ensure that you uphold network connection compliance. To this end, the way you access the different government community networks has not changed in UKCloud for VMware. In the Assured security domain, you'll always have an internet connected edge. Access to other networks is as follows: For HSCN you'll need to sign up to the terms of the HSCN Connection Agreement For PSN you'll need to get accreditation for the service you want to provide from the PSN Authority For Janet you'll need to engage with your Cloud Architect In the Elevated security domain: For PSN you'll need to gain approval from the PSN Authority For RLI you'll need to get approval from the MOD For Cross Domain Security Zone services (Walled Garden or SRA) you'll need to get the authorisation from your end-customer IA as well as the UKCloud SIRO The application processes haven't changed for any of these services, however it's important to be mindful about how you may have to design your architecture based on the network architecture you'll be deployed on. As an example, when connecting to HSCN, you'll need to ensure that the HSCN and internet networks aren't bridged. With the Cloud Fabric architecture and NFT architecture (shown in the two diagrams below respectively), you should ensure that VMs are not connected to both the internet and to HSCN at the same time.

    "keywords": "Oversized VMs on UKCloud for VMware Although UKCloud recommend a maximum permitted configuration of 12 vCPU and 128 GiB RAM for virtual machines (VMs), a small number of customers have been creating customised VMs that exceed this configuration. We understand that customers may have been doing this in an effort to increase VM performance, and in the most extreme scenarios customers have assigned more vCPU and memory than is physically available on the host. Unfortunately, this approach does not necessarily increase VM performance and in many circumstances this has the opposite effect. UKCloud have configured the service to dynamically move workloads to quieter hosts when the current host experiences a sustained level of increased activity. By increasing the resource requirements, the ability to move a VM from a busy host to a quieter host is significantly impacted. As the VM resources are increased, the likelihood of that amount being free on another host is significantly diminished, which effectively locks the VM to the current host. The impact to a customer VM is twofold: Reduces the reliability of performance Potentially affects VM availability in the case of a failure UKCloud must also consider the impact that these abnormally large VMs have on other users of the service as oversized VMs consume additional resources and cause performance issues for other VMs. With this mind, UKCloud advises customers that VMs that exceed the maximum resources permitted for UKCloud for VMware are not allowed. We run regular reports to identify customers with VMs that breach these limits. In the first instance, we will contact customers to help them overcome some of the issues they are experiencing, but we reserve the right to terminate excessively large VMs should they start to affect the stability of the platform for other UKCloud customers.

    "title": "Pricing information for UKCloud for VMware",
    "keywords": "Pricing information for UKCloud for VMware Overview UKCloud for VMware VM pricing can be as low as 1p per hour. Full pricing with all options, including licensing and connectivity, is available in the UKCloud Pricing Guide . UKCloud for VMware VMs are priced per hour. Your bills are based on actual consumption, so if you're not using a VM, you can turn it off so you don't need to pay for it. Our flexible VM sizes enable you to map resources to your existing specifications. Calculating the cost Follow these easy steps to define your solution and calculate the costs: Choose the security domain your workload needs to use: the DDoS-protected, internet-connected Assured OFFICIAL domain or the non-internet facing Elevated OFFICIAL domain. Choose the workload type and VM size that best suits your application, for example a Medium POWER VM: ESSENTIAL. Automated rebalancing is enabled to ensure the workload receives the requested performance. VMs can have contended resource allocation. POWER. VMs have an uncontended compute (CPU/GiB) resource allocation. Automated rebalancing is enabled to pre-emptively optimise performance and availability. PRIORITY. VMs have an uncontended compute (CPU/GiB) resource allocation. Automated rebalancing is configured to reduce workload movement around the platform, reducing workload disruption. (Optional) Choose any additional storage needed to support your application. You can add as many storage options as you need for the different aspects of your application, for example, Tier 1 for a high I/O database application and Tier 2 to store infrequently accessed media. (Optional) Choose the VM protection and block storage protection needed for your solution. This could be either Snapshot Protection, Journaling Protection or both. However, you must match your VM protection and block storage protection in each case. For example, if you choose Journaling Protection for your VM, you must also choose Journaling Protection for your block storage, that is, Journaling Protection will apply to both. (Optional) Add the Advanced Management option. This option includes Distributed Firewall (DFW), Distributed Logical Router (DLR), L2 VPN advanced networking options and advanced metrics and monitoring provided via the vRealize Operations Tenant Appliance. (Optional) Choose your operating system licensing, such as Microsoft Windows Server or Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Add up the options you've chosen: VM total/hour = VM + Protection + Licensing Storage GiB/month = Storage + Protection To understand your likely monthly cost: VM = (VM total/hour) multiplied by (hours in operation) Storage = (Storage GiB/month) multiplied by (GiB allocated) To model a total cost of ownership, you may also want to consider additional elements, such as connectivity, and service options, such as Cloud Enablement and cross domain services. Pricing examples Example 1 Example 2 An application with lower priority workloads, such as temporary applications, data processing or system modelling tasks. Security domain: Assured OFFICIAL Workload type: ESSENTIAL VM size: Small Block storage used: 100GiB Tier 2 block storage Protection option: 14-day Snapshot Protection Advanced management: No Operating system: Red Hat Enterprise Linux VM cost per month A Small ESSENTIAL VM in the Assured OFFICIAL security domain costs £0.040 per hour. 14-day Snapshot Protection for a Small VM costs £0.06 per hour. Red Hat Enterprise Linux OS licensing for a Small VM costs £0.040 per hour. In an average 730 hour month, the monthly VM cost works out at: Hours in operation x (VM + Protection + Licensing) = VM cost per month 730 x (£0.040 + £0.06 + £0.040) = £102.20 The Advanced Management bundle is not required so there is no additional uplift. Storage cost per month A Small VM includes 60GiB of free Tier 2 block storage, so an additional 40GiB is chargeable. Tier 2 block storage costs £0.10 per GiB month. 14-day Snapshot Protection for storage costs £0.10 per GiB month. (Storage + Protection) x GiB used = Storage cost per month (£0.10 + £0.10) x 40 = £8.00 Total basic cost Calculate the total basic cost by adding together the monthly VM and storage costs. VM cost per month + Storage cost per month = Total basic cost £102.20 + £8.00 = £110.20 An application with key workloads that are resource intensive, such as web and application workloads, mid-sized databases and caching services. Security domain: Assured OFFICIAL Workload type: POWER VM size: Medium Block storage used: 160GiB Tier 2 block storage Protection option: 14-day Journaling Protection Advanced management: Yes Operating system: Microsoft Windows Server VM cost per month A Medium POWER VM in the Assured OFFICIAL security domain costs £0.220 per hour. 14-day Journaling Protection for a Medium VM costs £0.10 per hour. Microsoft Windows Server licensing for a Medium VM costs £0.051 per hour. In an average 730 hour month, the monthly VM cost works out at: Hours in operation x (VM + Protection + Licensing) = VM cost per month 730 x (£0.220 + £0.10 + £0.051) = £270.83 The Advanced Management bundle is required so there is a 15% additional uplift on the VM, bring the VM cost per month to £311.45 . Storage cost per month A Medium VM includes 60GiB of free Tier 2 block storage, so an additional 100GiB is chargeable. Tier 2 block storage costs £0.10 per GiB month. 14-day Journaling Protection for storage costs £0.18 per GiB per month. (Storage + Protection) x GiB used = Storage cost per month (£0.10 + £0.18) x 100 = £28.00 Total basic cost Calculate the total basic cost by adding together the monthly VM and storage costs. VM cost per month + Storage cost per month = Total basic cost £311.45 + £28.00 = £339.45 Discount options The following discount and purchase schemes are available with UKCloud for VMware: Commitment discount Annual subscription discount Cloud Credits For more information about the discount and purchase schemes offered by UKCloud, see the UKCloud Pricing Guide . Additional pricing notes VM sizing For user-defined VMs, the highest resource closest to the VM size will dictate the cost. For example, a VM with 2 vCPUs and 16GiB will be charged at the Medium High Memory cost. Storage Micro VM pricing incudes 500MHz, 10GiB of Tier 2 storage; all other VM sizes include 60GiB of Tier 2 storage. 60GiB of Tier 2 storage is included in the pricing for all VMs whilst they are powered on, except for Micro. For VMs in a powered-off state, consumed storage will be charged at the prevailing rate. If you select all Tier 1 storage, there is no free storage allocation. Consumed storage includes VM catalog images and snapshots. VMs with additional allocated storage will be charged at the prevailing storage rate, regardless of their powered-on/off state. Protection You must choose the same protection option for both VMs and storage. Licensing SQL Standard is charged per hour based on the powered-on state of the host VM. SQL Enterprise is charged monthly. You must report, via support ticket, which VMs have either SQL Standard or Enterprise installed so that we can license and bill you accordingly. You do have the option to bring your own licences for SQL under Microsoft Mobility, though you must inform us as soon as you receive confirmation from Microsoft that mobility has been agreed. For more information, see How to license Microsoft applications/software on the UKCloud platform . Microsoft Windows Server licences must be provided by UKCloud and you'll be billed per hour based on the powered-on state of the host VM. If you want to host Oracle solutions on our platform, consult our Cloud Architects, or consider our Dedicated Compute v2 or Private Cloud for Oracle Software services to avoid licensing issues. Snapshots Self-service snapshots created within VMware Cloud Director will be charged at the rate of the storage they are stored on (Tier 1 or Tier 2), and charged per GiB per month. You can use the 60GiB of free VM storage for snapshots. Independent disks Independent disks will be charged at the rate of the storage they are stored on, along with any additional protection applied (Journaling or Snapshot Protection) and charged at a rate per GiB per month. As an independent disk can be mounted to any VM inside a customer's VDC, it cannot be included in the 60GiB of free VM storage. Billing and payment information Billing for the service is one month in arrears. The minimum unit of time for use is one hour. Part hours will be rounded up. Actual real-time resource usage is measured to the nearest second. At the end of each day, periods of time in identical VM state are grouped together and the total for each group in seconds is rounded up to the nearest hour. An identical VM state has the same power status, VM size, service level, storage size, protection and licensing. Where rounding up of multiple periods in differing states during the same day would result in more than 24 hours of charges, the period with the lowest price per hour is rounded down. For example, if a VM was switched off for a total of 890 minutes but was on for 550 minutes, the billable hours would be rounded up to 10 hours for when the VM was on and the off period would be rounded down to 14 hours to cap the day at 24 hours. Payment can be made by direct bank transfer (BACS/CHAPS). You can find bank details for payment on your invoice. Billing information is provided in an evidence file on the first working day of the month for your previous month's spend. For more information about the invoice evidence file, see Understanding your invoice evidence file . Termination fees There are no termination fees for the service. You are responsible for extracting your own data from the platform if required. UKCloud may make an additional charge for transferring data out of the service. Free trials We offer a 30-day free trial so that you can test and evaluate our service without commitment. Your trial provides you with a live environment on the UKCloud platform to test our services and verify whether they are suited to your needs.

    "title": "UKCloud for VMware options",
    "keywords": "UKCloud for VMware options Introduction Each enterprise application has its own set of technical and service requirements that must be addressed on an individual basis. UKCloud for VMware is completely configurable, and gives you the flexibility to use different service levels, virtual machine (VM) sizes, security domains, connectivity and data protection options. Security domain The UKCloud provides two security domains: Assured OFFICIAL provides access to public networks, such as the internet, PSN, HCSN and Janet Elevated OFFICIAL provides access to restricted networks, such as RLI, with no direct internet connectivity Choose the security domain your workload needs to use. Workload (VM) type Some workloads require the highest levels of resilience and performance, some are sensitive to changing conditions, whereas others merely require a reliable infrastructure. Tailor the compute characteristics of the VM to support the requirements of your workload. Choose the workload type that best suits your application: ESSENTIAL - For lower priority workloads, such as temporary applications, data processing or system modelling tasks. VMs in the VDC can have contended compute resource allocation (CPU/RAM) and automated rebalancing is enabled to ensure the workload receives the requested performance. POWER - For key workloads that are resource intensive, such as web and application workloads, mid-sized databases and caching services. VMs in the VDC have an uncontended compute resource allocation and automated rebalancing is enabled to pre-emptively optimise performance and availability. PRIORITY - For critical workloads that handle important business processes that benefit from a steady state of operation. VMs in the VDC have an uncontended compute resource allocation and automated rebalancing is configured to reduce workload movement around the platform. Storage options You can choose from a variety of options, depending on whether your workload requires high performance or longer-term retention storage. You can even deploy mixed environments to deliver exactly what you need. Choose any additional storage needed to support your application and add as many storage options as you need for the different aspects of your application. For example, you could use Tier 1 storage for the high I/O database application and Tier 2 to store seldom-accessed media. Tier 1 storage provides fast block storage, optimised for data warehouses, busy transactional databases and other high IO workloads. Tier 2 storage provides general all-purpose block storage, providing a balance of performance and cost. Data protection options Whether you're driven by recovery point (RPO) or recovery time (RTO), you can choose the right level of automated, on-platform protection for your environments. The UKCloud for VMware service offers three different protection options for your VMs. Catalogue and template-based recovery is a configuration management solution that can reprovision stateless servers to a new VM when required, using standard and catalogue-based VM templates. Snapshot Protection provides a daily backup of your VMs. You can select a retention period of either 14 or 28 days. For more information, see the Snapshot Protection Service Scope . Journaling Protection uses journals to store all write operations made to your VMs on a separate UKCloud site. For more information, see the Journaling Protection Service Scope . Choose the application and data protection needed for your solution. You can choose only one protection option to cover both VMs and storage. For example, if you choose Journaling Protection for your VMs, you cannot then choose 14-day Snapshot Protection for your storage; Journaling Protection will apply to both. Advanced management options The Advanced Management bundle provides: Advanced monitoring, provided by the vRealize Operations (vROps) Tenant Appliance. Using advanced monitoring, you can view metrics and reports relating to your UKCloud for VMware environment. For more information, see How to access advanced monitoring using the vRealize Operations Tenant Appliance . Additional distributed networking functionality.

    "keywords": "Retrieving snapshot summaries for multiple accounts using the Portal API Overview In the UKCloud Portal, you can view backup summary reports for all the compute services (vOrgs) in an account (see the Monitoring the status of Snapshot Protection section of How to manage Snapshot Protection for your VMs ). If you want to retrieve snapshot information from multiple accounts, rather than navigating to each account and viewing separate reports, you can use the Portal API to retrieve and aggregate the information and pipe it into a single list or export it into a file. This article provides an example script to demonstrate how you can use the Portal API to retrieve a snapshot summary for all your compute services across multiple accounts. About the Portal API endpoints The compute_services API endpoint retrieves information about each compute service in an account. The information includes backup details for each VM: \"inBackup\": true, \"lastBackupStatus\": \"Successful\", \"lastBackup\": \"Completed on the night of: 24/04/2020\", \"retentionLength\":28, \"backups\":[ { \"status\":\"Completed\",\"backupSlot\":\"night of: 24/04/2020\", \"backupStart\":\"24/04/2020 01:32\", \"backupEnd\":\"24/04/2020 01:35\", \"snapshotRemovalStart\":\"24/04/2020 01:34\", \"snapshotRemovalEnd\":\"24/04/2020 01:35\" For more information, see the GET /api/accounts section of the UKCloud Portal API Reference Guide . The accounts endpoint returns the account IDs of each account associated with the currently authenticated user (see the GET /api/accounts/:account_id/compute_services section of the UKCloud Portal API Reference Guide ). You can then use these IDs with the compute_services endpoint to loop through each account, retrieving all the backup information in a single operation. About the script After authenticating with the API, the example script pipes in objects retrieved using the accounts endpoint and uses the ID field to loop through all accounts associated with the authenticated user and retrieve the compute services for them, providing information on organisations, VDCs, vApps and VMs. The script generates a snapshot summary report from selected fields and this report can be listed in the pipeline or exported to a .csv file.

    "keywords": "Fixing your IPsec VPN following upgrade to NSX 6.4 With the upgrade to NSX version 6.4, VMware have made a security change to the default settings of the NSX edge gateway's IPsec VPN service. The new default for IPsec VPN service is to use the DH-14 (Diffie–Hellman group 14) algorithm during phase 1 negotiation of the VPN tunnel. You have the option of selecting a different version of Diffie-Hellman in the advanced gateway GUI. The following versions are supported: DH-2 (Diffie–Hellman group 2) DH-5 (Diffie–Hellman group 5) DH-14 (Diffie–Hellman group 14) DH-15 (Diffie–Hellman group 15) DH-16 (Diffie–Hellman group 16) However, during the upgrade of one of our regions we discovered that for edges that have not been converted to advanced gateways that have VPNs configured, the upgrade changes the config on the VPN tunnels to use the DH-14 algorithm instead of the previously only available DH-2. As a result, VPN tunnels are then broken until either of the following is performed: The edge with the affected VPN is upgraded to an advanced gateway and the VPN config is changed from DH-14 back to DH-2 The peer end config is amended to use DH-14 for its ike negotiation UKCloud support staff can change the VPN config back to DH-2 on a temporary basis until the edge is converted, however the setting is not persistent, and under certain configuration changes to an edge, the setting of DH-14 may be reapplied. Converting to an advanced gateway does not require any downtime nor cause any outage during the conversion. Follow the steps below to convert your edge to an advanced gateway and configure your VPN back to DH-2. To complete these steps, you must have access to the UKCloud Portal and VMware Cloud Director. Change your VPN settings To change the DH setting on your broken VPN: In the VMware Cloud Director Virtual Data Center dashboard, select the VDC that contains the edge with the broken VPN. In the left navigation panel, under Networking , select Edges . On the Edge Gateways page, select the edge that you want to configure and click Services . On the Edge Gateway page, select the VPN tab, then the IPsec VPN tab. Select the IPsec VPN Sites tab. Select the VPN tunnel that is broken and click the edit icon. From the Diffee-Hellman Group list, select DH2. You may need to scroll the window to the bottom of the page to find the list. When you're done, click Keep . Repeat the steps 6 and 7 for any other VPNs that are broken and when you're ready to save the configuration, click Save Changes at the top of the page.

    "keywords": "TCP_TW_REUSE and TCP_TW_RECYCLE settings Recent releases of the VMware edge gateway networking component have the TCP_TW_REUSE and TCP_TW_RECYCLE settings enabled on all interfaces by default. When an edge is redeployed, the configuration reverts to these default settings. These settings are designed to reduce the amount of time TCP connections states are left open, following the cessation of user data traffic flowing across the socket. The reuse and recycle options differ slightly in their operation, with the recycle option being more problematic for devices behind NAT rules. Both of these settings involve a mechanism by which the TIME-WAIT state of the TCP connection is shortened, allowing the server in the client-server relationship (for example, your edge gateway load balancer) to regain ephemeral ports at a faster rate. TCP_TW_REUSE uses server-side time-stamps to allow the server to use a time-wait socket port number for outbound communications once the time-stamp is larger than the last received packet. The use of these time-stamps allows duplicate packets or delayed packets from the old connection to be discarded safely. TCP_TW_RECYCLE uses the same server-side time-stamps, however it affects both inbound and outbound connections. This is useful when the server is the first party to initiate connection closure. This allows a new client inbound connection from the source IP to the server. Due to this difference, it causes issues where client devices are behind NAT devices, as multiple devices attempting to contact the server may be unable to establish a connection until the Time-Wait state has aged out in its entirety. Note The TCP_TW_RECYCLE option has been deprecated by VMware from NSX 6.4.1 onwards. You do not need to take any action as we will be removing this option before we proceed with our planned upgrade to the latest version of NSX. Removal of this option will not have any impact on your environment. For a further explanation of the reuse and recycle settings, refer to the following link: https://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/2014-tcp-time-wait-state-linux.html Due to the implementation of both of these settings by default, there are instances where TCP sockets are closed prematurely. This is particularly noticeable where a large amount of NAT rules or Load balancers are configured on the edge gateway, with moderate to high traffic throughput. Depending on how the client application layer is designed to handle such interruptions in network layer communications, this may manifest to end users as application hangs or crashes.

Browser support VMware Cloud Director 10.1 is compatible with the current major and previous major releases of the following browsers: Google Chrome Mozilla Firefox Microsoft Edge Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 Changes to APIs VMware Cloud Director 10.1 supports the VMware Cloud Director API version 34.0 (see https://code.vmware.com/apis/912/vmware-cloud-director ). For information about the changes to the VMware Cloud Director API for this version, see VMare Cloud Director API Schema Differences . VMware Cloud Director 10.1 is the last release of VMware Cloud Director to support vCloud API 30.0. The 30.0 and 31.0 versions of the API are deprecated in this release and will not be supported in future releases. The following API versions are still available: 30.0 (deprecated) 31.0 (deprecated) 32.0 33.0 34.0 Sandbox for testing Cloud Director API UKCloud provides sandboxes to enable you to test the next versions of the Cloud Director API so that you can prepare for VMware Cloud Director upgrades. Our latest sandbox ( https://vcd.latest.ukcloud.com/login/ ) has been upgraded to VMware Cloud Director 10.1.2. To gain access to the sandbox, raise a Service Request via My Calls on the UKCloud Portal. Note Some VMware Cloud Director features may be available in the sandbox that will not be enabled in UKCloud for VMware after the 10.1 upgrade. If there's a 10.1 feature that you're particularly interested in, contact your Service Delivery Manager to register interest so that we can consider it for our roadmap. Known issues Known issues you may experience following the upgrade to VMware Cloud Director 10.1 include: Known issues in VMware Cloud Director See Known issues in VMware Cloud Director . Known issues in the UKCloud Portal Changes to the Cloud Director authentication API mean that the UKCloud Portal function to restrict IP access to the API also restricts access to the VMware Cloud Director Tenant Portal (see How to restrict access to VMware Cloud Director ). If you have set up these restrictions, you'll need to confirm that the additional restriction of access to the Tenant Portal does not cause issues. Changes to the Cloud Director API mean that we are no longer able to display VM storage information in the My VMs area of the UKCloud Portal. Instead, you can access storage usage information within the VMware Cloud Director Tenant Portal (see How to view storage profile usage ).

    "keywords": "Known Issues in VMware Cloud Director Overview This article describes some of the issues we've identified when using VMware Cloud Director, along with workarounds if available. VMRC console window doesn't show correct VM name Issue When you change the name of a VM, the VMRC console shows the old VM name. Solution There currently isn't a fix for the VMRC console. We recommend using the web console instead, which should show the new VM name. Date formats are in MM/DD/YYY format Issue Dates are displayed using the American MM/DD/YYYY format. Solution It isn't currently possible to change the date formatting. We've raised a request with VMware to enable the customisation of date formatting. vApp search functionality doesn't work correctly Issue Search for a vApp using the search icon on the right-hand side of the menu bar. Select the vApp. The details of the vApp are displayed, including the VMs contained in the vApp. Search for a different vApp using the same search method and select it. The details of the second vApp are displayed, but the name of vApp is still shown as the first vApp. Any options selected from the Actions menu will apply to the first searched vApp not the second one. Solution We recommend searching for vApps by clicking vApps in the left navigation panel, then using the search functionality on the vApps page. Cannot amend VM hardware configuration Issue If you've enabled the Enable VM to join domain options for a VM, either currently or in the past, you won't be able to amend the hardware configuration of the VM. Solution If you encounter this issue, you can raise a Service Request to obtain a workaround. Guest customisation failing Issue Guest customisation is failing in the following: For existing VMs - Windows 2012, Windows 2012R2 and Windows 2016 For new VMs - Windows 2012, Windows 2012R2 When setting a new administrator password and/or changing the IP address then forcing re-customisation at power-on, the settings are ignored. Solution The workaround is to deploy the template, but before powering on, change the VM type to Windows 2016. Power on using Force Customization.

UKCloud has enabled these upgrades across our entire UKCloud for VMware estate. Any new virtual machines (VMs) will, by default, be created with the updated virtual hardware version. Any existing VMs and templates will continue to use their currently configured virtual hardware version until such time as you select to change this. Any clones/copies of VMs or templates will retain the same virtual hardware version as the source image. Prior to upgrading the Virtual Hardware version, you should note the following: You cannot downgrade the hardware version of the virtual machines in a vApp The vApp/VMs must be stopped and its virtual machines must have the latest version of VMware Tools installed. How do I manually upgrade the Virtual Hardware version of my VM? Log into the UKCloud Portal and access VMware Cloud Director. For more detailed steps, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware . In the Virtual Datacenters dashboard, select the virtual data centre (VDC) that contains the VM you want to upgrade. In the card for the VM that you want to upgrade, from the Actions menu, select Upgrade Virtual Hardware Version . Click OK to complete the upgrade. Are there precautions I need to be aware of? The update of CPU features may result in some operating systems being reconfigured on their next reboot.

    "href": "articles/vmware/vmw-ref-vm-data-recovery.html",
    "title": "Virtual machine data recovery options",
    "keywords": "Virtual machine data recovery options Introduction There are three methods of creating a recovery point for your virtual machines (VMs): VM snapshot - provides the ability to rollback or recover from a change. We recommend that snapshots on a single VM do not span more than 14 days for performance reasons elaborated on below. VM copy - creates a master image to clone additional VMs from an existing VM. VM backup - provides disaster recovery from file corruption or deletion. Each of these methods is discussed below to ensure that you are able to backup and recover your data in the most efficient and appropriate way. VM snapshot When you create a VM snapshot, you grab a VM and all its data and configuration at a specific point in time (a snapshot). This is achieved by locking the main image of the VM, writing all subsequent updates, creations or deletions to a separate file (a delta) outside of your main image. Use case When planning to deploy a kernel upgrade in Linux, take a snapshot prior to performing the upgrade. When you have applied and successfully tested the upgrade, you should remove the snapshot. If the upgrade is not successful or does not pass the quality check, you can simply rollback the changes by reverting to the snapshot. Pros You are able to complete this task autonomously, without intervention by UKCloud. You can create a temporary recovery point while the VM is still running and then quickly rollback from any changes or updates made to the VM, should undesirable outcomes occur (for example, during a Windows Update). Cons You can create only one snapshot for each VM, with each subsequent snapshot overwriting the previous one. You should use snapshots only as a temporary solution, as the longer the snapshot is running, the more changes will be lost should the snapshot be restored. In addition, due to the way that snapshots capture all changes to a separate file, storage costs will increase as a result of having to store both the original master VM image and you may also encounter a negative impact to the overall performance of the VM. How to create a VM snapshot In the card for the VM that you want to create a snapshot for, select Actions then Create Snapshot . VM copy When you copy a VM, you create an exact replica of the VM in either the same vApp or a different vApp. Use case When creating a web application that can scale across multiple VMs of the same configuration, you can build an image to the required specification and then copy that VM to create a master image (gold build). When required, you can deploy subsequent VMs from this gold build in a consistent fashion, enabling swift scaling of your environment. Pros You can easily create a gold build of VMs, thereby creating one image that you can then use to create additional VMs in a controlled and consistent fashion, without having to build each VM completely from scratch. Cons You must power down the VM prior to taking a copy. Each additional copy will consume as much storage as the original and consume additional memory and CPU cycles while the VMs are running. How to create a VM copy In the card for the VM that you want to copy, select Actions then Copy to . VM backup You should view backup as a disaster recovery mechanism, whereby you can restore entire environments or individual files in the event of the original becoming unavailable as a result of corruption or accidental deletion. You can add any VM to the automated snapshot backup schedule so that it is automatically backed up on a daily basis (Snapshot Protection). You can choose to retain snapshot backups for either 14 or 28 days. Data is backed up at the hypervisor level and provides a crash‑consistent image. Use case If you accidentally delete or amend a file that should not be modified, you can restore the file in question from backup by raising a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. Pros You gain peace of mind that data is backed up nightly for a rolling period of 14 or 28 days without any manual intervention. Cons Time taken for a restoration request to be completed (dependent on the amount of data to be restored).

    "title": "Virtual machine disk limits and considerations",
    "keywords": "Virtual machine disk limits and considerations To ensure the performance and stability of your VMs, whilst also being able to ensure the integrity and validity of VM backups, UKCloud advises the following soft limits on storage presented to individual VMs: 2032 GB for each virtual disk (VMDK) presented to a VM, this will ensure normal snapshot functions will operate correctly Maximum of 20 virtual disks presented to a VM Maximum of 40TB overall storage presented to a VM Storage controllers Increasing the number of disks per controller can have a performance impact. For high I/O machines we'd recommend minimizing the disk to controller ratio. Also using the paravirtualised controller can result in greater throughput and lower CPU use. Note VMware Tools is a pre-requisite for the deployment of paravirtualised disks. Snapshots A VMware snapshot is a copy of a VM's disk at a given point in time, it's not a complete copy of the original and rather it only copies the delta disks. An excessive number of delta files in a chain (caused by an excessive number of snapshots) or large delta files may cause decreased virtual machine and host performance. UKCloud recommends the removal of snapshots on a regular basis (24-72 hours) in line with VMware best practices to maintain consistent performance of VMs. There will be times when standard platform maintenance tasks need to be performed, resulting in VMs moving around the infrastructure. VMs with large (2TB) hard disks presented will take an extended time for operations to complete, during which time other tasks against the VM could be blocked. UKCloud strongly recommends, where possible, to scale environments horizontally instead of vertically. We understand this may not always be possible, however in doing so you are ensuring reliability and consistency of performance in the environment as it grows, for further design considerations or assistance contact your Account Director who will be able to put you in touch with one of our Cloud Architects.

In the card for the VM, select Actions , then Install VMware tools . Login to the operating system and follow the wizard to install the tools. Reboot. Linux There are two methods of installing the VMware tools for Linux, from within VMware Cloud Director using the method above or installing the open-vm-tools, which are now supported by VMware. Not all distributions provide support for the open-vm-tools however the following well known distributions do: Centos 5/6/7 Redhat 5/6/7 Ubuntu 12.04/14.04 Installing the VMware tools via VMware Cloud Director requires modules to be built against the running kernel. If the kernel is updated, the administrator needs to run the VMware tools setup again to recompile the modules. UKCloud recommends using the open-vm-tools because this maintenance is handled by the package manager when the kernel is updated. Redhat/Centos 5/6/7 The open-vm-tools is available via the epel repository. Add epel repository. sudo yum install epel-release If the command above fails then you can run the following commands dependent on the version you are running: Redhat/Centos 5 wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/5/x86_64/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm sudo rpm -Uvh epel-release-5*.rpm Redhat/Centos 6 wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm sudo rpm -Uvh epel-release-6*.rpm Redhat/Centos 7 wget http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/e/epel-release-7-5.noarch.rpm sudo rpm -Uvh epel-release-7*.rpm Install open-vm-tools No reboot required.

    "keywords": "UKCloud for VMware Service Scope About this document This document describes the boundaries of the UKCloud for VMware service, along with the division of responsibilities between UKCloud and the customer, to facilitate the provisioning and ongoing use of the service. About UKCloud for VMware The UKCloud for VMware service provides a secure, scalable and cost-effective platform for hosting virtual machines (VMs) of various sizes with different service levels. You can use the platform to build new services quickly and securely; and migrate, augment or transform existing applications. The platform is immediately available so you can provision and scale VMs in minutes. Service architecture Your UKCloud service architecture is as follows: Company. Your contract with UKCloud is associated with a company, which provides a single owner for the contract, regardless of how many accounts are created. Account. We use accounts to separate financial ownership. An account could represent an organisation, a customer contract, or a specific project. An account can also have several UKCloud services associated with it, such as UKCloud for VMware, Cloud Storage and UKCloud for OpenStack. You can also use accounts to separate users based on access requirements or permissions. Organisation (vOrg). This represents your UKCloud for VMware service inside VMware Cloud Director and on the UKCloud Portal. There is a 1:1 mapping of service to vOrg. Virtual data centre (VDC). A VDC is where you define your workload type and build your virtual machines (VMs). You can create VDCs through the UKCloud Portal or the Portal API. Service options You can build a tailored solution to meet your requirements by mixing and matching service options. The choice does not lock you to one service or size, allowing you to scale resources up or down as your requirements change. Workload type. Workload type Resource allocation Automated Rebalancing ESSENTIAL Contended Configured to meet requested performance POWER Uncontended (CPU/GiB) Pre-emptively optimises performance and availability PRIORITY Uncontended (CPU/GiB) Configured to reduce workload movement around the platform, reducing workload disruption VM size. There are 11 T-shirt sizes available for VMs, with varying vCPU and RAM configurations, ranging from 1vCPU and 512MiB RAM to 12vCPUs and 128GiB RAM. You can change the size of your VMs after creation through VMware Cloud Director. Full details of the available service options are outlined in the Service Definition . Storage options All workloads (except micro) include 60GiB of Tier 2 storage for free, all storage is persistent and resilient to local hardware failures. Micro sized VMs include 10GiB of Tier 2 storage. Additional storage can be purchased to support your application. Multiple storage options can be used to support different aspects of the application. Tier 1. Our most performant storage for workloads requiring consistently higher disk throughput. Tier 2. Persistent block storage with typical performance characteristics for use by production applications or storage. Storage policies We provide you with access to two storage policies: tier 1 and tier 2. Both policies have a 10TiB quota of storage to allow for rapid expansion of services as required. We do not guarantee storage performance, as it can be affected by many factors We do not provide IOPs figures for our storage offerings Workloads can use multiple storage profiles Protection Customers have a range of automated, on-platform protection options to choose from for their environments: Catalogue and template-based recovery. All customers have access to catalogue and template-based recovery as standard. This is a configuration management solution that can re-provision stateless servers to a new VM when required, using standard, and catalogue-based VM templates. Snapshot Protection. 14-day or 28-day snapshot policies available. Data protected by the snapshot has an RPO of 24 hours, with RTO determined by the time taken to restore the VM after the Service Request is raised. See the Snapshot Protection Service Scope for full details. Journaling Protection. A non-invasive, self-service disaster recovery solution with configurable recovery points, providing near real-time data protection. Journaling profiles provide a target RPO of 5 minutes and journal histories of 2, 7, 14 or 28 days. The Journaling Protection Service Scope covers the full details of this protection option. Advanced management This bundle includes Distributed Firewall (DFW), Distributed Logical Router (DLR), Layer 2 VPN and vROPs Tenant Monitoring and Metrics. Note These services may not be available in all regions and zones. Service availability UKCloud platform availability is based on the workload type you purchase. The service level agreement (SLA) for POWER workloads guarantees 99.99% availability. ESSENTIAL and PRIORITY workload SLAs guarantee 99.95% availability. You are entitled to claim Service Credits for outages to services that take you out of SLA. For more about how we calculate SLAs, see the SLA Definition . Service background We maintain the standard VM template sizes that control allocation of CPU and resources. VMs are fully provisioned. The system is configured to automatically balance resources, so your VMs may vMotion between physical hosts. PRIORITY workloads are configured to reduce movement around the platform. To maintain performance across the platform, UKCloud can perform movements/migrations of VMs, vApps or storage within the infrastructure assigned to a service. We actively capacity-manage the cloud platform to ensure you have access to the resources you request. The UKCloud platform is designed using sites, regions and zones. The relationship between them is shown below: You can specify Farnborough or Corsham as the site where you would like to have your service provisioned. We will try to accommodate requests and will advise you if we are unable do so. We control the deployed versions of technology on the platform. This covers internal platform-supporting technologies, and any technology versions available to you. Internally this includes, but isn't limited to, the vSphere and ESX versions, and the hardware version of the platform. Externally this includes the available versions of the edge gateway and VMware Cloud Director. Promiscuous mode is disabled. You can set affinity or anti-affinity rules through VMware Cloud Director so that VMs do, or do not, run on the same physical host. You can make additional configurations inside a VM (such as acting as a secondary hypervisor or implementing third-party software technologies). We do not support customer implementations inside a VM. Operating systems Licensing. We can provide: OS licensing through the SPLA and academic frameworks for Microsoft Red Hat Enterprise Linux licensing For the latest available licences, please check the UKCloud Pricing Guide . You can bring your own licensing for Red Hat and certain Microsoft application licensing under Microsoft Mobility using software assurance. If you're providing your own licensing, you should inform UKCloud by raising a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal for a retrospective discount. For non-UKCloud issued software, you must obey the licensing requirements of the software provider. This includes being aware of any constraints around using the software in a virtualised environment. VM server images. We provide base VM images for the operating systems (OS) for which we provide licensing. You can access these from VMware Cloud Director. You can use your own images for non-Windows and RHEL services, where licensing stipulates that to use the VM on our platform it must be licensed (and reported back to the software vendor) by UKCloud. Update services. We make update repositories available for all software for which we provide licensing. We don't provide software update facilities for non-UKCloud licensed software. Anti-virus. We do not provide anti-virus software as part of the service. Networks A full overview of the connectivity options and network architecture is available in Understanding connectivity options in UKCloud for VMware . We manage the physical firewalls that face public and secure networks. Internet-facing solutions have 2 usable public IP addresses. You can ask for additional public IP addresses by raising a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. We reserve the right to decline the request if you have spare capacity in your existing deployment. PSN-facing solutions. You should raise a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal to be assigned your IP address. Contended bandwidth (uncapped). Janet and HSCN solutions have one usable IP address. You can request additional IP addresses by raising a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. From a customer management experience, you manage all your connectivity rules, such as firewall, IPsec VPN and NAT functionality, through your edge gateway, using either the UKCloud Portal GUI or API. Edge gateway (previously vShield Edge) By default, we assign one edge gateway per connectivity type. For VDCs you create through the Portal API, you are responsible for creating your own edge gateway. You can have up to nine Org VDC networks per edge gateway. vApp edge. vApp networks allow you to create smaller networks within individual vApps which have a vApp Edge, similar to the edge gateway on your VDC. Although a vApp Edge isn't as feature rich as an edge gateway, it lets you create firewall and NAT rules to separate your VDC networks from your vApp virtual machines (VMs). See vApp networking for configuration details. Site-to-site IPsec VPN. You can create IPsec VPN tunnels to connect the services located behind different NFTs. You can also externally configure IPsec VPNs. There is a limit of 64 tunnels per edge gateway. SSL VPN. You can create SSL VPN tunnels that terminate on the edge gateway, providing up to 50 concurrent users with access to that VDC. We recommend you use this for occasional administrative purposes, rather than as part of a regular end-user design. Load balancing. The edge gateway acts as a basic layer 3 load balancer, including features such as session persistence and health checks. If you need more advanced load balancing, you should consider a third-party product. Bring Your Own Firewall Bring Your Own Firewall allows you to customise your networking infrastructure by installing your own virtual firewall appliance in place of the edge gateway included as standard. We don't offer a rebate for unused edges. If you choose to bring your own firewall, you are completely responsible for the deployment, configuration and management of that firewall. If you change from a UKCloud-provided firewall to your own firewall, we will redeploy your firewall on to a dedicated network and you will need to migrate your environment to that network. Full customer and UKCloud responsibilities can be found in the Bring Your Own Firewall Service Scope . Protective monitoring We have implemented GPG 13-aligned Protective Monitoring across the Assured and Elevated platforms at the hypervisor level and below. We don't provide Protective Monitoring services above the hypervisor (for example, for your VM) - it is your responsibility to act at this level. In line with UKCloud's SISP, we provide notification of customer-impacting security incidents. It is your responsibility to report similar incidents to us. Platform management Users can access, manage and view the UKCloud for VMware service, accessing only those features allowed by their role, in any of the following ways: vCloud API. Enables the programmatic creation and management of VMs inside the platform. VMware Cloud Director tenant portal. Provides a graphical interface to access the VMware Cloud Director environment (depending on assigned permissions). UKCloud Portal. Enables the creation of compute services and subsequently VDCs and edge gateways. The Portal also includes an overview of actual and estimated spend, along with service configuration information. Access to incident and request management is also possible through the Portal. You cannot access the underlying infrastructure. This includes (but isn't limited to) the hardware and the vSphere environment. Service migration You can move your workloads from a local VMware or Hyper-V powered environment onto the UKCloud platform using Migration to the Cloud (powered by Zerto). You can find pricing information in the UKCloud Pricing Guide . Customers are free to migrate their workloads. You can also request a migration through a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. Migrations may be between: Services (for example, ESSENTIAL to POWER) UKCloud sites or zones The Assured and Elevated security domains Service reporting Visibility. Maintenance notifications and Service Status reports are delivered through the Portal. Billing. We provide you with monthly bills covering your monthly spend. Customer service Cloud Architect. UKCloud Cloud Architects support you during the design of solutions for the cloud platform. UKCloud Cloud Architects are ideally placed to help reconcile your requirements with the UKCloud platform. We recommend engagement with a Cloud Architect when implementing complex solutions, such as those using HybridConnect or a Walled Garden. Service Delivery Manager (SDM). An assigned point of contact who will provide any assistance you require during your use of the service, including onboarding, service reviews and incident reporting and escalation. Support Desk. After the initial on-boarding and design phase, you can utilise the standard UKCloud support entitlement, which is documented in the Customer Engagement Factsheet . Customer responsibilities You are responsible for assessing whether the UKCloud platform can support the various requirements of your application. The control and management of access and responsibilities for end users including appropriate connectivity, security and accreditation if required. If access is required over government secure networks (HSCN, Janet, RLI or PSN), the customer is responsible for adhering to the relevant Code of Connection (CoCo) and for providing evidence of their CoCo to UKCloud upon request. UKCloud is unable to provide access to secure networks where such evidence has not been provided by the customer. Management and administration of layers above the hypervisor (OS patching, application performance monitoring, user administration). The customer is also responsible for ensuring only lawful data that supports the UK public sector is stored and processed by applications on this environment, and that they fully comply with the UKCloud Security Operating Procedures (SyOPs) and other information assurance requirements as specified in the UKCloud System Interconnect and Security Policy (SISP) and associated accreditation documentation sets. Service provisioning Within 4 hours of accepting an order (shorter deployment times are typically achieved and can be prioritised upon request), UKCloud will create the customer's Primary Administrator account and send a Welcome Pack which includes the URL for the UKCloud Customer Portal, and the getting started guide. Customers can self-provision UKCloud for VMware services via the UKCloud Portal or the Portal API.

    "keywords": "Bring Your Own Firewall Service Scope About this document This document is intended for UKCloud customers who might be considering an alternative virtual firewall or virtual appliance to the presently integrated NSX Edge Services Gateway device within VMware Cloud Director. The scope of the document is not to provide step by step detail on how to setup or install an alternative virtual firewall but rather the key points that a customer should consider when choosing an alternative product. The document describes the responsibilities of both UKCloud and the customer in order to facilitate the changes required. About Bring Your Own Firewall Bring your own firewall enables customers to customise their networking infrastructure by installing their own virtual firewall appliance in place of the NSX Edge Services Gateway device UKCloud includes as standard with its compute services. This can enable customers to leverage their own in-house expertise with a particular technology or can provide access to some higher level networking functionality not natively available in the NSX Edge Services Gateway device. Default setup Presently UKCloud only offers a \"bring your own firewall\" installation to new VDCs. In a BYOF implementation, UKCloud present an external network directly to the customer, who can then install the firewall instance of their choice. UKCloud responsibilities Upon a customer's request, UKCloud will: Deploy a new VDC without an NSX Edge Services Gateway device Present the external network to the customer for them to install their own firewall device Once the customer has installed their own firewall device, UKCloud will continue to: Manage platform availability Manage the external network Customer responsibilities By requesting to have the edge gateway device removed and their own firewall technology installed, the customer accepts that: Customers are responsible for sourcing their own licensing arrangement with the 3rd party firewall provider. Customers are responsible for installing and configuring the firewall device. UKCloud do not offer any support of customer installed firewall replacements. This includes but is not limited to install, configuration and troubleshooting issues. UKCloud will not be able to perform any network diagnostic tasks on the customer side of the firewall (inside the VDC). Outages caused by the customer's new firewall will not be liable to Service Credit claims. Customers lose the visibility of the IP address assignments which are currently easily referenced within VMware Cloud Director. Customers lose the integrated functionality of configuring the edge gateway device through VMware Cloud Director. Access to the new firewall replacement is only available via the console or from within the customer VDC (based on setup).

    "keywords": "Dedicated Compute v1 Service Scope About this document This document describes the boundaries of the Dedicated Compute v1 service, along with the division of responsibilities between UKCloud and the customer to facilitate the changes required. Note This article provides information for existing customers of our Dedicated Compute v1 service. If you're looking to purchase Dedicated Compute, refer to the Dedicated Compute v2 Service Scope . About Dedicated Compute Dedicated Compute enables you to have a reserved, single-tenanted section of our cloud, where the physical CPU and RAM allocations are known. This service is designed for customers who: Are looking to run abnormal sized VMs - such as those larger than our standard T-shirt sizes Looking to meet specific software licensing requirements Have an increased security requirement that can be met by Dedicated Compute infrastructure Default setup We deliver Dedicated Compute by providing you with dedicated physical blades on which you control resource allocation. The initial Dedicated Compute purchase is a starter pack consisting of two physical blades. The standard blade consists of 20 physical cores (40 hyper-threaded cores) and 300 GiB of RAM. You can then scale your estate by purchasing expansion packs. After nine expansion packs, you must buy another starter pack. You choose between Tier 1 or Tier 2 storage for your VMs, both of which can include a backup service. Full details of service options and pricing are given in the UKCloud Pricing Guide . The storage pool isn't a dedicated hardware resource: it is drawn from our Cloud Storage solutions. These resources are grouped in a private virtual data centre (pVDC) which is available only to the individual Dedicated Compute customer. Resilience and resource reservations We operate at least N+1 for hardware resilience on our Dedicated Compute service. However, we recommend sizing your resilience according to your workload profile. We will reserve at least one physical blade's worth of resources from your allocation to ensure that, in the event of a hardware failure, the service can continue to run and support your workload. During a failure scenario, VMs will be restarted on surviving hosts within the Dedicated Compute cluster. UKCloud is not responsible for any performance degradation of VMs in the Dedicated Compute cluster caused during a failure scenario due to over contention in the remaining hosts. The table below shows the configuration, the resources available to a customer, the number of physical blades in the configuration, and the UKCloud resources reserved to run it. Customer available resources Physical blades Resource reservation Starter pack 20 cores, 300 GiB RAM 2 50% (20 cores, 300 GiB RAM) Starter pack + 1 expansion pack 40 cores, 600 GiB RAM 3 33% (20 cores, 300 GiB RAM) Starter pack + 2 expansion packs 60 cores, 900 GiB RAM 4 25% (20 cores, 300 GiB RAM) Resource utilisation To improve performance, Dedicated Compute uses all physical resources available in the installation and balances the load across them, without consuming the reserved capacity mentioned above. This means that in general operation within the starter pack, there is a 50% utilisation of both physical blades: However, you can create VMs of any size and shape you require, up to the maximum size of the physical capacity of one blade - 20 physical cores (40 vCPU) and 300 GiB RAM. A VM cannot span across physical blades so, if you create a VM larger than 50% of the blade capacity, the Dedicated Compute installation may carry more of the contingency capacity of one physical blade than of the others: You can over-contend the resources on your Dedicated Compute as you see fit. Deployment options There are two deployment options for Dedicated Compute: UKCloud-defined - You select a workload type for your VDC based on UKCloud for VMware VM types (ESSENTIAL, POWER or PRIORITY). Any VMs will inherit the characteristics and reservation levels of that service when deployed. Customer-defined - You can set reservation levels on a per-VM basis. Platform management Dedicated Compute is managed in the same way as our other cloud services, using VMware Cloud Director, the UKCloud Portal, and APIs associated with both. The Dedicated Compute service will be maintained to the same software patch revisions as our main platform. It's not currently possible to see the level of provisioned/utilised resources against the Dedicated Compute service on the UKCloud Portal. (This is a development item on the UKCloud Portal roadmap.) In the meantime, we can provide this information on request. Service provisioning You can request Dedicated Compute via your account manager or using the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. The minimum commitment period to the service is 90 days. The notice period is 90 days. On receipt of all relevant information, we will deploy the service within 10 working days for standard configurations. Customer responsibilities You need to be aware of the following customer responsibilities relating to deployment of, configuration of and migration into the Dedicated Compute service, which are in addition to the usual responsibilities placed on customers of our UKCloud for VMware service: Creating VMs in the new environment Migrating VMs from existing environments by cloning and copying turned-off VMs, or by moving turned-off vApps to the new environment Ensuring you have the right licensing in place for the applications in use in your Dedicated Compute environment If you select the customer-defined deployment option, you must manage your own reservation levels It is your responsibility to purchase enough Dedicated Compute modules to ensure that there is enough resource available to your VMs in the event that one or more hosts fail. If you need any help ensuring you have enough resource in your Dedicated Compute cluster, contact your Cloud Architect.

    "keywords": "On-Premises VMware Extended Support Service Scope About this document This article describes the boundaries of the UKCloud On-Premises VMware Extended Support (VMware Extended Support) service, along with the division of responsibilities between UKCloud and the customer, to facilitate the provisioning and ongoing use of the service. About the On-Premises VMware Extended Support service The VMware Extended Support service provides ongoing Level 1 and Level 2 support for VMware estates where vSphere licences are operating on currently unsupported versions such as v5.5 and v6.0. ESXi 5.5 was End of General Support on September 19th 2018 ESXi 6.0 was End of General Support on March 12th 2020 This service provides organisations with additional time to plan upgrades to supported levels of VMware or migrations onto new platforms or services, such as UKCloud's range of public and private clouds operating at OFFICIAL and above. This service is not intended as a permanent solution for providing these levels of VMware support, as the lack of patches and vulnerability fixes will increase the risk factor for cyber-attack and vulnerability. UKCloud provides support through our award-winning Service Desk, where our 10 years of operating a significant VMware estate has developed depth and breadth in our VMware skills and capabilities. Support is provided on the basis of all reasonable endeavours. It's important to note that any issues beyond Level 2 cannot be progressed any further, as VMware will not provide any support until the licences have been upgraded to a supported level. Application process Customers wanting to discuss the suitability of the service and gain a comparative cost estimate for their VMware environment under the VMware Extended Support programme should contact us at info@ukcloud.com or contact their Client Director. To provide an indicative quote, we will need a report from vCenter(s) detailing all virtual machines (VMs) and vRAM allocation/reservation. We will then work with the customer to find the ideal solution to suit their requirements. This will include discussing monthly or annual upfront payments, which include additional discounts. Once the quote is supplied and the customer wants to place an order, they must provide a purchase order. Once received, the order will be confirmed by our sales operations team. Service provisioning To implement the VMware Extended Support service, there are some simple steps that need to be completed both by UKCloud and the customer. The details that follow assume that the customer has a good understanding of VMware and can carry out the required actions. Note that, if required, UKCloud can provide assistance in these actions at an additional charge, based on our SFIA Rate Card for Professional Services. Welcome pack When we receive an order from the customer, we will provide an emailed welcome pack to the named administrator/contact identified in the order form. The welcome pack includes: Log in address of the UKCloud Portal Log in credentials for the UKCloud Portal Links to useful VMware Extended Support articles in the Knowledge Centre To set up the vCloud Usage Meter, we will provide: UKCloud VMware contract number UKCloud VMware partner ID UKCloud Site ID In addition to the emailed welcome pack, a Service Delivery Manager will contact the customer to support them with the tasks required (as outlined in this Service Scope) and answer any questions. UKCloud Portal access All UKCloud customers have access to the UKCloud Portal, where they can access the My Calls ticketing system to raise service requests. We also use the UKCloud Portal to track and log all customer enquiries, requests, support issues, communications and information. Knowledge Centre To assist customers in using our services and all functionality, the UKCloud Knowledge Centre is continually maintained to provide the latest information. Key articles for VMware Extended Support are listed at the end of this Service Scope. Onsite audit During the initial provisioning of the customer onto VMware Extended Support, the customer must provide information relating to the current environment to enable UKCloud to deliver the appropriate services. If the customer is unable to provide the necessary information, or provides inaccurate information, UKCloud reserves the right to conduct a chargeable, high-level audit of the customer's VMware environment, and other connected software, to ensure that there will not be any conflicts, incompatibility or potential support issues. Licence eligibility VMware Extended Support is operated on the existing perpetual licences owned by the customer. Should additional licences be required, these can be provisioned under the VMware Licence Service (VLS). VMware Extended Support covers vSphere and vCenter. Other elements of VMware deployment, such as vRealize Operations, vSAN, NSX, SRM and Horizon may be supported on an exception basis. The following are NOT eligible under VMware Extended Support: WSP1, Avi Networks, Velocloud, Carbon Black, Pivotal Usage Meter VMware Extended Support operates on a consumption basis and therefore requires the mandatory installation of the vCloud Usage Meter on the customer's environment, to allow the monthly consumption to be recorded. The Usage Meter captures all the VMware usage covered by the VMware Extended Support agreement during the month and creates a report with the number of units consumed for each VMware bundle. This report of total units is used by UKCloud to calculate the customer's invoice for each month and enables the customer to be flexible on what they use in any given month, rather than be committed up front. UKCloud will make the URL of the recommended Usage Meter available to the customer. UKCloud provides detailed instructions in the Knowledge Centre for the installation, configuration and reporting of the Usage Meter (see the list of articles at the end of this Service Scope). It is the customer's responsibility to install and configure the Usage Meter prior to using the service as it is required for reporting and invoicing. The customer can utilise UKCloud Professional Services at an additional cost if assistance is required for this task. As the Usage Meter is installed in an environment that UKCloud has no access to: It is the customer's responsibility to ensure that the Usage Meter is correctly configured and that it is collecting the daily data. Customers will need to monitor the Usage Meter to ensure that data is not missing or that the meter has not failed. If there is an issue, it is the responsibility of the customer to resolve this issue or raise a service request to seek assistance. It is the customer's responsibility to update the Usage Meter when required when a new version is provided by UKCloud. The customer will be advised as to when the update must be implemented, and this may be a requirement for the reporting to be accurate. It is the customer's responsibility to add new products to the Usage Meter so that usage is collected. Usage reporting The basis of VMware Extended Support is that the customer is not committed to any specific VMware usage. This enables the customer to increase, decrease, test and remove environments and functionality as they require. As a result, VMware Extended Support depends on the vCloud Usage Meter to collect the actual monthly usage on an hourly basis. As part of the configuration of the Usage Meter, automatic reporting on the 1st of each month is emailed to vls@ukcloud.com. If, for any reason, this fails or cannot be configured, it will be the customer's responsibility to manually send reports within five (5) working days of the last day of the reporting month (that is, 6 November 2021 for October 2021 usage). It is essential that this is completed so that the usage can be added to UKCloud's VMware usage and reported to VMware. A Knowledge Centre article explains how the usage must be reported. If the reports are not received within five working days, the customer's assigned Service Delivery Manager will contact them to request the reports. If the reports are not received within 10 working days, the customer's invoice will be estimated based on the previous two months' usage. Once the customer's usage is received or estimated, it will be sent to their Service Delivery Manager who will include this in the monthly updates and reports so that the customer can track their usage and costs. It is important to note that the customer must send Usage Meter reports to UKCloud as this is the basis of the contract and ensures accurate reporting and invoicing. If an estimation is used, UKCloud reserves the right to add any additional usage to future invoices once the missing reports are sent to ensure that the customer has been accurately invoiced for their actual usage and that UKCloud correctly reports all VMware usage to VMware. Support VMware Extended Support includes support via our experienced VMware Customer Service Team, which has been responsible for supporting our VMware-based public cloud for nine years. Support under VMware Extended Support is only provided for Level 1 and Level 2 incidents. These will be resolved with all reasonable endeavours by UKCloud. Level 3 issues and above cannot be escalated to VMware without the environment being upgraded to a current VMware supported vSphere version. Support is provided specifically to the VMware environment and does not extend to integrations to other services. This support does not entitle the customer to upgrades, patches or vulnerability fixes on the VMware licences being operated. Should upgrades to licences be required, VMware Extended Support can be seamlessly replaced with the VMware Licence Service (VLS) to move the licences back onto a supported level. For more information regarding support hours, SLA and escalation, see the How to raise and escalate support tickets with customer support article on the Knowledge Centre. Note that there is no limit to the number of tickets that customers can raise. Customer responsibilities In addition to the responsibilities already mentioned in this Service Scope, customers are also responsible for: As UKCloud does not have any direct physical or network connection to the customer's environment, it is the customer's responsibility to ensure they maintain previously supported combinations of VMware software and any third-party software as identified within the compatibility matrix. See the following VMware documents for assistance: VMware Lifecycle Product Matrix VMware Compatibility Guide Partner Verified and Supported Products (PSVP) Listing The customer is responsible for maintaining their VMware environment, including any software and hardware upgrades, including third-party software that may affect the VMware environment. Customers may be asked on occasion to run authorised scripts on their VMware environment for the purpose of maintaining the environment or assisting in fixing reported issues. Customers will be advised on how to resolve an issue and will be responsible for implementing that fix. To assist in the resolution of an issue, the customer may be required to share screens using Microsoft Teams or other collaboration applications with our support team. All support issues must come directly to UKCloud support. Pricing and billing Pricing packages VMware Extended Support is charged on a consumption basis, with costs aligned with the number of VMs and associated vRAM allocation. This consumption is recorded each month by the Usage Meter and reported to UKCloud. A minimum charge of £1,000 (plus VAT) applies to VMware Extended Support service provision. Payment options Consumption is estimated at the outset and calculated for a 6 or 12-month initial period. Subsequent periods can be for 6 or 12 months. Invoicing Customers will be invoiced in advance for each 6 or 12-month estimate of consumption. The customer will receive a monthly report from their Service Delivery Manager based on their submitted Usage Meter usages and total costs. Professional Services This Service Scope sets out the responsibilities of UKCloud and the customer. Although the actions that the customer is responsible for are supported by UKCloud via Knowledge Centre articles and the support team, if a customer requires additional support with their on-premises estate or the installation and configuration of any element of VMware or the Usage Meter, we can arrange for our Professional Services team to assist. These additional services are charged as per our SFIA Rate Card . If a customer requires the assistance of our Professional Services, they can either contact our support team or their Service Delivery Manager.

    "keywords": "Journaling Protection Service Scope About this document This document explains what is and isn't included in the scope of the Journaling Protection service option. Journaling Protection is one of a variety of on‑platform protection options available from UKCloud. Use this Service Scope to understand Journaling Protection and whether it will meet your own recovery point (RPO) or recovery time (RTO) objectives. About Journaling Protection Journaling Protection (powered by Zerto) is a powerful, self-service replication and recovery tool that can improve organisational resilience and enable seamless migration of applications between UKCloud's enabled regions. You can protect your Virtual Machines(VMs) by adding Journaling Protection to the vApp that contains those VMs. When you add Journaling Protection to a vApp, every write operation to the VMs in that vApp is copied and stored in a journal on the recovery site. This means that in the event of a VM being compromised, (for example, by a virus attack or bad software update) you can quickly recover the VM to a point in time before the event. You can add Journaling Protection to a vApp by adding it to a virtual protection group (VPG). Each VM in the protected vApp is synchronised to the recovery site and a journal is created. After this initial sync, each subsequent write operation to the VM is processed as normal on the protected site and a copy is asynchronously sent to the recovery site and written to the journal. When the specified journal history is reached (for example, 14 days), as new journal entries are created, older entries are written to the recovery VM's virtual disks. Every few seconds a checkpoint is written to every journal for each VM in the VPG to ensure crash-consistency between the VMs. If you need to recover a VM, you select a checkpoint to recover to. For example, in the case of a virus, you could recover to a checkpoint from before the virus attack. During recovery, the vApp and its VMs are created on the recovery site and the recovery disks for each VM are attached to the recovered VM. Information in the journal is then promoted to the VM to bring it up to the date and time of the selected checkpoint. Frequency and timing UKCloud's Journaling Protection service is designed to provide customers with recovery points that are as little as seconds behind the running VM. UKCloud's standard journaling profiles provide: Target RPO of 5 Minutes Journal history of 2, 7, 14 or 28 days At present, UKCloud have not enabled the ability for customers to configure custom profiles. If the target RPO is exceeded, the customer and UKCloud will be notified via the Zerto self-service portal. Factors that can affect the RPO are: Rate of change of the data on a VM. VMs with a large rate of change in the data will potentially achieve slightly longer RPO's than those VMs that have a lower rate of change Any network latency or storage performance challenges. UKCloud monitors its estate to ensure that network and storage performance are in line with platform expectations. Any deviations are alerted to our technical teams to resolve. Additionally, the service will also alert if a customer's journal exceeds 75% in size of the original VM. This alert is utilised to understand if the customer's solution is being protected adequately. Journaling Protection only works for VMs currently on the platform and it will only capture data whilst a VM is turned on. If a VM is deleted in VMware Cloud Director, Journaling Protection will IMMEDIATELY delete the associated journal. What SLA do you offer on Journaling Protection? UKCloud do not offer an SLA around the VMs protected by UKCloud's Journaling Protection solution. However, the status of journaled VMs is monitored continuously, and the UKCloud support team investigates all failures or service degradation. Other The service is not backed by service credits. On occasion, Planned Maintenance may disrupt the operation of the Journaling Protection service. This may lead to the service being unavailable, or a temporary increase to the RPO a customer may be able to achieve on the platform. If there's a potential disruption, we'll highlight this to you via the service status page and UKCloud Portal notifications system. Journaling Protection management Customers of the Journaling Protection service are able to self-manage their protected environment via the self-service portal. This portal allows customers to: Configure virtual protection groups Opt vApps into the VPGs Monitor the performance of their platform View the current RPO of their applications and current available history Perform test failovers Perform live failovers UKCloud have disabled some areas of the self-service portal as they are for services we do not presently support. These include: Backup to external systems. At present, customers are unable to export their journal to external backup targets (such as UKCloud Cloud Storage). We have identified a compliance issue with this solution which we are working to address. Until this is addressed, the feature will remain unavailable. Alerting and reporting The self-service portal provides live real time reporting of your solution and the current level of protection being provided to your vApp. The self-service portal will also provide customers with alerts should the target RPO of their VPG exceed the threshold, or the associated journal size grows beyond the expected size. In both these scenarios, UKCloud will also receive a platform monitoring alert and will perform further investigations if this frequently alerts. Additionally, the self-service portal provides visibility of an activity log of the actions against a particular VM and a list of any errors captured on the platform. Failover The Zerto self-service portal allows customers the ability to failover to their recovery site. When this is initiated, the Journaling Protection service will failover the VMs inside a vApp, restoring the data and state of the VMs to the desired point from inside the Journal. The Journaling Protection service can also replicate any internal networking rules. The customer will need to manually configure: External networking configurations - including configuring VPNs and making any external firewall or DNS changes Check for application consistency Licensing All licensing is provided by UKCloud. At present, customers cannot bring their own licensing. Feedback If you find a problem with this article, click Improve this Doc to make the change yourself or raise an issue in GitHub.

    "title": "Snapshot Protection Service Scope",
    "keywords": "Snapshot Protection About this document This document explains what is and isn't included in the scope of the Snapshot Protection service option. Snapshot Protection is one of a variety of on‑platform protection options available from UKCloud. Use this service scope to understand Snapshot Protection and whether it will meet your own recovery point (RPO) or recovery time (RTO) objectives. About Snapshot Protection UKCloud offers a choice of snapshot options that operate as a daily backup service for customers using our VMware‑based compute services. You can choose from the following Snapshot Protection policies: 14‑day snapshot 28‑day snapshot When you opt a virtual machine (VM) into a Snapshot Protection policy, the VM is added to a daily automated snapshot. The snapshot is of the entire VM running on your UKCloud for VMware service. Data protected by the snapshot has an RPO of 24 hours. RTO is determined by the time taken to restore the VM after you've raised a Service Request. Snapshot Protection is chargeable based on the number of VMs protected and the capacity utilised to store the data. No protection products are automatically applied to VMs running on the UKCloud platform, therefore you must explicitly select the protection option that best meets your requirements. Frequency and timing Snapshots are scheduled to occur once in a 24-hour period. Snapshots take place 365 days of the year and are started inside the UKCloud‑defined window: 20:00-08:00. Snapshots are not started before 20:00 or after 08:00. We cannot guarantee the time at which your VM will have a snapshot taken inside this window; the time may also vary from day to day. The time of a snapshot is reported via the UKCloud Portal the next day. There's a system hard stop at 09:00, at which time any active snapshots are cancelled. Due to the higher rate of new data on a VM's initial snapshot backup, each new VM is automatically configured with 'overtime' enabled on it's first backup. This enables it to run to successful completion beyond the standard backup window (20:00-08:00) if required. This helps to ensure the initial backup completes on the first attempt, particularly for large or high change rate VMs. The flag is removed after the first successful backup. Success rate We do not guarantee successful snapshots. We can provide you with guidance on suitable candidates for Snapshot Protection (data change rate/size). For regions 1, 2, 7 and 8, large VMs (2 TiB+) with high change rates are not recommended for Snapshot Protection, as the service will spend longer trying to establish what has changed and then attempt to back all of it up. You should take an alternative backup approach with VMs of this size in these regions. For regions 5, 6, 13 and 14, you can use Snapshot Protection for large VMs. However, you should still consider the impact of recovery time for large VMs. VM snapshots may be attempted more than once to obtain successful status. Only the final state will count in our calculations. Partial snapshots and those with errors count as failed. Any snapshots still in progress at 09:00 are considered as failed. Due to the higher rate of new data on a VM's initial snapshot backup, each new VM is automatically configured with 'overtime' enabled on it's first backup. This enables it to run to successful completion beyond the standard backup window (20:00-08:00) if required. This helps to ensure the initial backup completes on the first attempt, particularly for large or high change rate VMs. The flag is removed after the first successful backup. Reruns We may attempt to rerun a failed snapshot inside the window, depending on the failure code. We will not rerun snapshots outside the window. What SLA do you offer on snapshot success? Automated VM snapshots don't include an SLA. You should be aware that snapshots may occasionally fail for a variety of reasons. The status of automated VM snapshots is monitored continuously, and the UKCloud support team investigates all failures. It isn't always possible to rerun an automated VM snapshot, if this service doesn't meet your own protection requirements, we can also offer Journaling Protection options. If none of these services meet your requirements, you can also implement and manage your own protection solution. The UKCloud Cloud Storage platform may be an appropriate target for self‑managed solutions using software such as CommVault and NetWorker. The service is not backed by service credits. Planned Maintenance On occasion, Planned Maintenance will take precedence over VM snapshots. If there's a potential disruption, we'll highlight this to you via the UKCloud Service Status page . Snapshot management You can make changes to your Snapshot Protection via the UKCloud Portal. You can: Opt VMs into Snapshot Protection Change the Snapshot Protection policy for a VM Opt VMs out of Snapshot Protection Set a default Snapshot Protection policy for a VDC Alerting and reporting Information about your backups is reported on the UKCloud Portal. Reports are updated daily and are available by 10:00, but typically within minutes of the close of the backup window. Reports are available covering every day of the retention period (14 or 28 days as appropriate). Alerting on individual VMs is not provided. Restores Timing and process You can ask to restore a VM by raising a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal, which is subject to standard support SLA timescales. Restores are performed outside of the backup window, unless a P1 incident is involved. You can find a definition of our support processes and severity categorisation in How to raise and escalate incidents and service requests . What you get We'll instantiate a new VM. This will incur additional storage charges. We'll provide an image from a successful snapshot of your choice from within the policy length (that is, the last 14 or 28 days). You'll need to make any necessary switchover/networking changes. Fair use policy You can request up to four restores per month. If you request more than this, we will suggest a Cloud Architect investigate. The total number of VMs (or disks) in a restore request should not exceed five. KPIs We'll proactively investigate failures on the platform on the following triggers: Individual customer VM: Two successive snapshot window failures A failure of three snapshots in 14 days Platform: More than 50 missed VMs (VMs that should be in policy, but have not been backed up) Less than 99% success rate for VM snapshot Feedback If you find a problem with this article, click Improve this Doc to make the change yourself or raise an issue in GitHub.

We will continue to provide support to customers who previously added Synchronous Protection to their environment, although we would encourage considering using Journaling Protection instead. About Synchronous Protection The UKCloud for VMware Synchronous Protection service option is designed to offer geographical protection of your live environments across both of our sites (Farnborough and Corsham; 60 miles apart). To achieve this, we utilise synchronous replication between sites to ensure that any changes made to your environment are committed to arrays in both sites before the write is confirmed as being complete to the VM OS. Synchronous Protection provides a replica of data (for any data written, and flushed to disk) and then enables the ability to migrate your VMs between the sites while they are running, offering a greater level of protection for live environments. Your service is only ever presented out of one of these sites (a VM exists in only one location at a time), but a synchronous copy between the sites ensures that an exact copy is stored in the second site, which can be brought online, with zero data loss, in the event of a failure. Synchronous Protection availability Synchronous Protection is currently available in regions 1, 2, 7 and 8. Design Synchronous Protection is an active‑passive solution. The solution offers failover to a second UK site, however your VM will be active in only one site at any given time. Customers relying on a single virtual firewall in their primary site should be aware that in some circumstances, such as a failure of the inter-site network, or of the customer's primary virtual firewall, access to their solution will be lost. If you require an active‑active solution, you can build across both sites and design in load balancing. Contact your Account Manager if you want to investigate this option. If a failure affects several VMs, they will be restarted in no particular order. We do not offer any controls to programmatically manage this - in most scenarios, the restart is automatic. If you need your VMs or vApps to be started in a particular order, we recommend that you restart them manually. Within each site we've architected a platform with a minimum of N+1 resilience, including routers and switches. RPO and RTO Synchronous Protection provides a disaster recovery service with an RPO of almost 0 seconds. The RTO is variable and will be influenced by factors such as your application design and the ability to failover networks. For clarity, this product does not use asynchronous replication technologies. The recovery point is the last write to disk with no historical recovery points (there is no ability to \"roll back\" to a previous version). If asynchronous replication with historical recovery points is required, consider Journaling Protection . Unplanned failover process We monitor the underlying physical infrastructure including the blades, routers and switches. There are a variety of scenarios that can trigger an unplanned failover event. In the majority of scenarios, failover activities are automatic. In scenarios such as multiple component failure, including loss of redundancy, in the majority of cases your VMs and edge gateway instances will be automatically brought online, either on an alternative physical device in the same site or in the second site. This is dependent on available resources. However, other scenarios can result in a full or partial failover, and in these cases we'll need to react differently. Manual failover In some scenarios a full automated failover will not be possible. In each case the remedial actions may be different, and we have a variety of tools, such as VMware vMotion and VMware Storage vMotion, that we can utilise to return your VMs to service. In the case that a site failover is not automatically completed, we use the entry criteria below to ascertain if there is a need for a manual failover. If a need is established, we review the technical considerations to ensure and validate the decision for a manual failover is both safe and appropriate. Entry criteria Yes/No Incident is site specific Outlook for recovery more than two hours Technical considerations Yes/No Control plane availability Storage consistency VM to VM network availability External network availability Entry criteria explained Are the service conditions met to confirm the need for a manual failover? Incident is site specific - An incident must be site specific (either Farnborough or Corsham). In the unlikely event the incident effects both sites, a manual failover will be unlikely to resolve the issue so will not be considered. Outlook for recovery more than two hours - In the event that a failover is not automatic, we'll conduct an initial technical investigation to identify the cause of the failure. This technical investigation is time‑boxed to two hours (including time to recover the service). If at any point in this assessment the outlook for recovery of normal service is deemed unlikely by the end of the time box, the issue will undergo technical consideration for a manual failover. Technical considerations explained If a failure meets the entry criteria described in the section above, we'll assess if there are any technical reasons preventing the initialisation of a manual failover. If these technical conditions are not met, a manual failover will not be attempted. But we'll continue to work to bring your VMs back online in the shortest possible timeframe. At any point in the technical assessment, we may return to considering a manual failover. Control plane availability - The control plane is defined as the platform for managing the environment (by us or by you). If the control plane is wholly unavailable, then our ability to execute a failover and manage the infrastructure will be compromised. Therefore, a failover would not be immediately possible. Storage consistency - This check is to ensure the data is available and consistent. Geo‑resilient storage is distributed evenly across a SAN spanning both UKCloud sites and is managed by vPlex. If the underlying SAN becomes compromised, VMs may lose connectivity with their data store. If the data is not consistent, a failover event will not be initiated. VM to VM network availability - This check is to ensure inter‑VM communication is functional and consistent. If a physical appliance such as a host fails, VMs may be relocated to restore connectivity and is unlikely to require a full site failover. If a virtual appliance such as a vShield Edge fails, failover may not resolve the issue and would potentially deviate technical resources from the recovery of the incident. External network availability - This check is to ensure external communication to the wider community is functional and consistent. This is specific to UKCloud connectivity to internet or PSN services. Each site has independent connectivity in addition to cross‑site connections. The failover decision will be dependent on the severity of the outage experienced; if outbound connectivity to the required networks is not available on the second site a failover event will not be initiated. Example scenarios and suitability for site failover The following are example Major Incidents that would trigger the question on whether to perform a failover. Incident Failover action Mitigation to minimise impact DDoS attack None Always-on hybrid DDoS solution Site fire/power outage Automatic or manual Secure site, fire suppression, standby generators, UPS, offsite backups Network connectivity between sites None Multiple DCI links - geographically diverse, multiple providers Compute: minor component failure Automatic Minimum of N+1 resilience, chassis and blades Compute: major component failure Automatic or manual Spare capacity/modular design/dual site Network hardware failure Automatic or manual Minimum of N+1 resilience, routers and switches Split site (OTV networking and management networking) Automatic or manual Multiple DCI links -- geographically diverse Failover timing The amount of time it takes for your services to failover will depend on the failure scenario, but generally the failover will take as long as the VM needs to reboot plus a small amount of additional time to invoke the failover - about 45 seconds. Some scenarios, such as a \"split brain\", can take longer, leading to an outage of two hours. Alerting and reporting A failover is a rare event and will normally be a result of a Major Incident. In these cases, we communicate to the wider community via the appropriate Portal and, if you have already reported an incident, via the ticket or by phone. You can also receive alerts via email subscription or using the Service Status page. We'll contact you after a failover to inform you that our actions are complete. We do not currently provide alerts when a VM is moved to a different site. However, you can check the location of your VMs. For more information, see How to use VM location . Networking For internet‑bound traffic, we manage an autonomous Border Gate Protocol (BGP) service that enables us to intelligently redirect traffic without affecting your IP address allocation. The resilience of the external connectivity into the Elevated OFFICIAL security domain depends upon, and is generally provided by, the access network. Behind the router layer, we have designed a network that stretches between our two sites. This allows for network connectivity (if installed in one site) to remain if your virtual firewall and UKCloud's physical firewall are in separate and alternative sites. We advise that you consider how additional services such as Cloud Enablement and leased lines will be affected in a disaster recovery scenario, as this falls outside the Synchronous Protection offering. UKCloud's firewalls are protected within each site, with the failover between the sites performed via an orchestrated process. We achieve this through a sequence of routing changes within our network (see the figure below). Failover testing If you want to test your own service, you can test the Synchronous Protection failover function by requesting a Test Scenario. Test Scenarios are designed to test and understand how your applications might react in a failover when the underlying physical hosts have failed (simulated in the scenario) or when the VMs have been migrated in a live state. A Test Scenario is not a customisable feature of UKCloud for VMware. Test Scenario limitations UKCloud will complete a Test Scenario for a maximum of one VDC (up to 10 VMs). This provides you with an experience similar to a live failover scenario. Test Scenarios take place only during office hours (0900 - 1730). The failover will be deemed a success by UKCloud when we can identify that the VMs are running in the second UKCloud site, using our own monitors and tools. Backups cannot take place during a failover. We will not failover the connectivity and physical firewall during a Test Scenario. You will experience a network latency of a few milliseconds through this firewall. UKCloud do not, at present, offer a \"hard failover\" test where a physical host is switched off to simulate a hardware fail event. Test Scenario options Option 1. Dynamically moving your VMs between the two sites: We'll dynamically move your VMs between our sites while the VMs remain online. There will be increased network latency between client VMs that are running in the different sites (around 4 -- 4.5ms). Option 2. Restarting your VMs between sites: Your VMs can be shut down and restarted in the secondary site. If the shutdown is non-graceful (power‑off as opposed to a guest OS shutdown), this simulates the effect of a physical server outage from an individual VM perspective. This is the equivalent of a total site failure. As our platform is multi-tenanted, we will not replicate a physical host failure to invoke a disaster recovery scenario as this could affect other customers. The failover exercise will be conducted and failed back to the originating site during office hours (0900 - 1730). Failover testing outputs Failover test are generally seamless for customers, making it difficult for you to gauge that it has taken place. To provide assurance that the test was successful, we'll produce a report for each customer that identifies the following: A sanitised (removing ESX host names) report of the ESX servers that the VMs are located on during the period of the failover test Comments and observations Requesting a Test Scenario To request a Test Scenario, you need to raise a Service Request within the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal indicating that you want to complete the test and provide the following details: VDC name VM names (up to 10) you want to failover Start and end time Any other requirements Note that the start and end times must be within office hours, which are 0900 - 1730. When we receive the request, we'll respond either accepting or rejecting it. Note that we require a minimum of five working days notice prior to the request. If we accept your request, we'll schedule the work to start at the time you specified as long as it is within office hours (0900 - 1730). Failover testing charges We generally allow a test to be conducted during office hours (0900 - 1730) with a charge (based on the SFIA Rate Card - level 3 Apply). Longer testing periods will need to be approved by UKCloud. Feedback If you find a problem with this article, click Improve this Doc to make the change yourself or raise an issue in GitHub.

    "title": "VMware Licence Service (VLS) Service Scope",
    "keywords": "VMware Licence Service (VLS) Service Scope About this document This article describes the boundaries of the UKCloud VMware Licence Service (VLS), along with the division of responsibilities between UKCloud and the customer, to facilitate the provisioning and ongoing use of the service. About the VMware Licence Service VLS is an innovative licensing model, designed with VMware, to reduce cost and deliver licence flexibility for a customer's existing VMware estate. This flexibility makes it easier to modernise existing VMware environments as the customer's organisation transforms IT services or adopts a multi-cloud approach. Whether purchasing new licences or providing support and maintenance on an existing VMware estate, VLS enables customers to exchange fixed upfront costs and long-term commitments with a VMware consumption-based licence provided via UKCloud. With this new operations model, the functionality of the VMware licences is identical, only the commercial, cost and commitment term is changed. Application process Customers wanting to discuss the suitability of the service and gain a comparative cost estimate for their VMware environment under the VLS programme should contact us at info@ukcloud.com or contact your Client Director. To provide an indicative quote, we will need: The customer's written authorisation to request data from VMware on the existing licence estate and renewal details The customer's VMware Entitlement Account (EA) number A report from vCenter(s) detailing all virtual machines (VMs) and vRAM allocation/reservation, plus additional elements on Horizon, SRM and vSAN, if deployed Details of the customer's planned future use of VMware to ensure the correct bundles/features are provisioned in any VLS proposal We will then work with the customer to find the ideal solution to suit their requirements. This will include discussing monthly or annual upfront payments, which include additional discounts. Once the quote is supplied and the customer wants to place an order, they must provide a purchase order, with a call off contract if transacted within the G-Cloud framework, where we have a specific VLS service listed. Once received, the order will be confirmed by our sales operations team. Service provisioning To implement the VLS service, there are some simple steps that need to be completed both by UKCloud and the customer. The details that follow assume that the customer has a good understanding of VMware and can carry out the required actions. Note that, if required, UKCloud can provide assistance in these actions at an additional charge, based on our SFIA Rate Card for Professional Services. Welcome pack When we receive an order from the customer, we will provide an emailed welcome pack to the named administrator/contact identified in the order form. The welcome pack includes: Log in address of the UKCloud Portal Log in credentials for the UKCloud Portal Links to useful VLS articles in the Knowledge Centre To set up the vCloud Usage Meter, we will provide: UKCloud VMware contract number UKCloud VMware partner ID UKCloud Site ID In addition to the emailed welcome pack, a Service Delivery Manager will contact the customer to support them with the tasks required (as outlined in this Service Scope) and answer any questions. UKCloud Portal access All UKCloud customers have access to the UKCloud Portal, where they can access the My Calls ticketing system to raise service requests. We also use the UKCloud Portal to track and log all customer enquiries, requests, support issues, communications and information. Knowledge Centre To assist customers in using our services and all functionality, the UKCloud Knowledge Centre is continually maintained to provide the latest information. Key articles for VLS are listed at the end of this Service Scope. Onsite audit During the initial provisioning of the customer onto VLS, the customer must provide information relating to the current environment to enable UKCloud to deliver the appropriate services. If the customer is unable to provide the necessary information, or provides inaccurate information, UKCloud reserves the right to conduct a chargeable, high-level audit of the customer's VMware environment, and other connected software, to ensure that there will not be any conflicts, incompatibility or potential support issues. License keys To activate the service, UKCloud will make the required licence keys available to the customer. These need to replace the existing licence keys within the customer's VMware environment. The VMware requirements will have been identified in the initial engagement, however, to ensure the right keys are provided, UKCloud Support will engage with the customer to identify the VMware modules that are to be used, including the exact version. UKCloud will request the correct keys and will make them available to the customer. It is the customer's responsibility to replace their existing keys with the new UKCloud versions. This must be completed immediately. The customer may be required to update or add licence keys for additional module usage. If the customer wants to use an additional VMware module, then they can request a new licence key as per the Knowledge Centre article. The licence keys supplied are for use with UKCloud VLS only and not for any VMware usage outside of the VLS contract. If the service is cancelled by the customer, the UKCloud issued keys are to be removed by the customer. Licence eligibility VLS covers the following: vSphere, vRealize Operations, vSAN, NSX, SRM, Horizon, plus all other licences captured by the vCloud Usage Meter Existing licence bundles (Essentials Plus Kits, and so on) will be broken into their standard element licence parts The following are NOT eligible under VLS: WSP1, Avi Networks, Velocloud, Carbon Black, Pivotal (until these appear on the product guide) Usage Meter VLS requires the mandatory installation of the vCloud Usage Meter on the customer's environment. For customers on a Fixed Price package, the Usage Meter is required for audit purposes and to determine when an uncommitted provision would be a lower cost. For customers on a Fully Metered package, the Usage Meter captures all the VMware usage covered by the VLS agreement during the month and creates a report with the number of units consumed for each VMware bundle. This report of total units is used by UKCloud to calculate the customer's invoice for each month and enables the customer to be flexible on what they use in any given month, rather than be committed up front. Horizon reporting is manually provided at the end of each month by capturing the 'maximum concurrency' reported in the Horizon portal. If both Fixed Price and Fully Metered elements exist in the same environment, then it will be necessary to deploy two Usage Meters. UKCloud will make the URL of the recommended Usage Meter available to the customer. UKCloud provides detailed instructions in the Knowledge Centre for the installation, configuration and reporting of the Usage Meter (see the list of articles at the end of this Service Scope). It is the customer's responsibility to install and configure the Usage Meter prior to using the service as it is required for reporting and invoicing. The customer can utilise UKCloud Professional Services at an additional cost if assistance is required for this task. As the Usage Meter is installed in an environment that UKCloud has no access to: It is the customer's responsibility to ensure that the Usage Meter is correctly configured and that it is collecting the daily data. Customers will need to monitor the Usage Meter to ensure that data is not missing or that the meter has not failed. If there is an issue, it is the responsibility of the customer to resolve this issue or raise a service request to seek assistance. It is the customer's responsibility to update the Usage Meter when required when a new version is provided by UKCloud. The customer will be advised as to when the update must be implemented, and this may be a requirement for the reporting to be accurate. It is the customer's responsibility to add new products to the Usage Meter so that usage is collected. Usage reporting The basis of VLS is that the customer is not committed to any specific VMware modules or usage, which converts their VMware usage from an upfront capital expenditure to a flexible monthly operational expenditure. This enables the customer to increase, decrease, test and remove environments and functionality as they require. As a result, VLS depends on the vCloud Usage Meter to collect the actual monthly usage on an hourly basis. At the end of each month, the report will identify the exact number of units consumed against the set VMware bundle codes, which is then used to create a total points usage. This total number of points is used to calculate the customer's invoice for the month and it is therefore essential to ensure that the Usage Meter is correctly configured and that reports are sent to UKCloud. With the current version of Usage Meter, Horizon maximum monthly concurrency must be manually reported to UKCloud, by email, to vls@ukcloud.com. As part of the configuration of the Usage Meter, automatic reporting on the 1st of each month is emailed to vls@ukcloud.com. If, for any reason, this fails or cannot be configured, it will be the customer's responsibility to manually send reports within five (5) working days of the last day of the reporting month (that is, 6 November 2021 for October 2021 usage). It is essential that this is completed so that the usage can be added to UKCloud's VMware usage and reported to VMware. A Knowledge Centre article explains how the usage must be reported. If the reports are not received within five working days, the customer's assigned Service Delivery Manager will contact them to request the reports. If the reports are not received within 10 working days, the customer's invoice will be estimated based on the previous two months' usage. Once the customer's usage is received or estimated, it will be sent to their Service Delivery Manager who will include this in the monthly updates and reports so that the customer can track their usage and costs. It is important to note that the customer must send Usage Meter reports to UKCloud as this is the basis of the contract and ensures accurate reporting and invoicing. If an estimation is used, UKCloud reserves the right to add any additional usage to future invoices once the missing reports are sent to ensure that the customer has been accurately invoiced for their actual usage and that UKCloud correctly reports all VMware usage to VMware. Note UKCloud may audit a customer's Usage Meter and VMware environment to ensure that the correct licensing and reporting is in place and that the usage being reported accurately reflects the customer's actual usage. Support VLS includes your VMware usage and support via our experienced VMware Customer Service infrastructure, which has been responsible for supporting our VMware-based public cloud for nine years. This support is available for all VLS issues or enquiries, and the support availability times are based on the severity of the support ticket. For more information regarding support hours, SLA and escalation, see the How to raise and escalate support tickets with customer support article on the Knowledge Centre. Note that there is no limit to the number of tickets that customers can raise. Horizon support is limited to the functionality of the Horizon VDI solution and does not include 'desktop end user' support, image support or the additional support of applications being run through the Horizon VDI solution. Customer responsibilities In addition to the responsibilities already mentioned in this Service Scope, customers are also responsible for: As UKCloud does not have any direct physical or network connection to the customer's environment, it is the customer's responsibility to ensure they are on supported versions of VMware software and that any third-party software is within the compatibility matrix. See the following VMware documents for assistance: VMware Lifecycle Product Matrix VMware Compatibility Guide Partner Verified and Supported Products (PSVP) Listing The customer is responsible for maintaining their VMware environment, including any software and hardware upgrades, including third-party software that may affect the VMware environment. Customers may be asked on occasion to run authorised scripts on their VMware environment for the purpose of maintaining the environment or assisting in fixing reported issues. Customers will be advised on how to resolve an issue and will be responsible for implementing that fix. To assist in the resolution of an issue, the customer may be required to share screens using Microsoft Teams or other collaboration applications with our support team. All support issues must come directly to UKCloud support, and not directly to VMware as UKCloud are contracted to provide support. It is UKCloud's responsibility to escalate an issue to VMware directly if required. Pricing and billing Pricing packages There are two packages available for pricing. Package Description Use case Payment options Fixed Price A fixed cost for a specific set of licences, irrespective of the actual usage made of the licences during the month. The price is set at the beginning of the year. Customers who have a good idea of their usage for the next year and need certainty in their budgets. Committed Fully Metered Pay-as-you-go - only pay for what you use. Consumption is calculated and the customer invoiced based on actual usage at the end of each month. Customers who need the ability to scale up and down as required. Committed Uncommitted Payment options There are two payment options available for VLS. Payment option Description Benefits Committed An estimated annual consumption is calculated using the current usage metrics provided by the customer. This amount is then invoiced and paid up front. Each quarter, using the reported consumption figures, the Service Delivery Manager will report on the amount consumed to date and the remaining value left in the pre-payment. Monthly reports can be requested as the pre-payment approaches zero to ensure that the top amount is applied in good time. At any point, the customer can top up the amount in pre-payment with a new order or, if on the fully metered package, switch to uncommitted billing (pay-as-you-go), as detailed below (note this is not available for the Fixed Price package). Most cost-effective option. Additional discounting available. Uncommitted Billing is based on actual consumption is billed calculated monthly from customer-supplied Usage Meter reports. Customers are charged on the next month's invoice (first working day of the month). Flexible, pay-as-you-go. No upfront costs. Cease service at any time, only paying for usage up to that point. Especially suited to customers who are reducing their on-premises VMware estate and migrating to cloud. For the Committed payment option, whilst the estimated one year consumption calculation is accurate, this is dependent on there being no changes to the environment or usage. Therefore, an increase in usage would result in the committed value expiring prior to 12 months, or likewise a reduction in consumption would result in the committed value covering greater than 12 months. For this reason each committed order is valid for consumption over the next 24 months. For both of the above options, where, for whatever reason, a usage report is unavailable within the prescribed time after the end of each month, UKCloud will report and invoice based on either the prior month's confirmed usage, or the initial estimated consumption as appropriate. For full pricing information, see the UKCloud Pricing Guide . Note that there is a discount level over £40,000 spent per month. Invoicing For monthly invoicing, VLS requires the output of the Usage Meter, and as this is not available until the end of each month, the customer will be invoiced one month in arrears. As an example, the customer must report October 2021 usage to UKCloud ( vls@ukcloud.com ) by the 6 November 2021 (within five working days). The customer will then be invoiced for this usage on the 30 November. The customer will receive a monthly report from their Service Delivery Manager based on their submitted Usage Meter usages and total costs. Professional Services This Service Scope sets out the responsibilities of UKCloud and the customer. Although the actions that the customer is responsible for are supported by UKCloud via Knowledge Centre articles and the support team, if a customer requires additional support with their on-premises estate or the installation and configuration of any element of VMware or the Usage Meter, we can arrange for our Professional Services team to assist. These additional services are charged as per our SFIA Rate Card . If a customer requires the assistance of our Professional Services, they can either contact our support team or their Service Delivery Manager. Offboarding If a customer ceases to use VLS, the following will apply: The customer must destroy the UKCloud-issued VMware licences and confirm via email to info@ukcloud.com that this has been completed UKCloud are no longer able to support the customer for any enquiries relating to their own on-premises VMware infrastructure Usage reports are no longer required to be sent at the end of each month The customer must ensure that they arrange for VMware support and licences through another partner or via VMware directly Supporting documents and resources For more information about VLS, see the following: VMware Licence Service Service Definition How to install the vCloud Usage Meter for the VMware Licence Service How to add products to the vCloud Usage Meter How to report licence usage for the VMware Licence Service How to request a new VLS licence Feedback If you find a problem with this article, click Improve this Doc to make the change yourself or raise an issue in GitHub.

    "keywords": "On-Premises VMware Extended Support Service Definition What is On-Premises VMware Extended Support? Our On-Premises VMware Extended Support (VMware Extended Support) service provides ongoing Level 1 and Level 2 support for VMware estates where vSphere licences are operating on currently unsupported versions such as v5.5 and v6.0. This service provides organisations with additional time to plan upgrades to supported levels of VMware or migrations onto new platforms or services, such as UKCloud's range of public and private clouds operating at OFFICIAL and above. This service is not intended as a permanent solution for providing these levels of VMware support, as the lack of patches and vulnerability fixes will increase the risk factor for cyber-attack and vulnerability. UKCloud provides support through our award-winning Service Desk, where our 10 years of operating a significant VMware estate has developed depth and breadth in our VMware skills and capabilities. Support is provided on the basis of all reasonable endeavours. It's important to note that any issues beyond Level 2 cannot be progressed any further, as VMware will not provide any support until the licences have been upgraded to a supported level. What the service can help you achieve Support – UKCloud provides Level 1 and Level 2 support for the vSphere licences on v5.5 and above that are no longer supported by VMware. Reduce risk – UKCloud's significant experience and capabilities in VMware reduce the risk in continuing to operate out of support platforms. Confidence – Have greater confidence that the existing platform will maintain stability whilst longer term plans for workload migration are achieved. Pay per VM – Our costs are associated with your VM count so as services move off your older platform your extended support cost naturally declines. In addition, UKCloud can assist in numerous ways to either support migration away from older platforms or provide experienced professionals to support your upgrade plans. Comsumption and pricing VMware Extended Support is calculated based on your usage of the VMware environment. This is calculated by the VMware Usage Meter, which sits alongside each vCenter and is configured to email a usage report to VMware each month. Pricing starts from £10 per VM per month for a VM with 8GB allocated. A minimum charge of £1,000 per month applies.

    "keywords": "VMware Licence Service Service Definition What is the VMware Licence Service? VMware Licence Service (VLS) complements our Managed IT Operations service, by offering a managed VMware licence service ideally suited to customers who: Are planning, or have already started, a multi-cloud strategy, where the operational costs associated with workloads can seamlessly move to the cloud provider as workloads migrate. Want to upgrade their on-premises VMware estate, with NSX, vSAN, SRM, vROps, Network Insight and Horizon, to enhance performance, security and resource allocation to enable the seamless migration to the cloud. VLS enables these enhancements for short deployment periods in the most cost-effective way. Want to migrate to a full rental/consumption-based OPEX model rather than a fixed-cost (CAPEX-centric) model on either an annual or monthly basis.

Are now ready, as part of their strategic cloud direction, to allow third-party expertise to provide enhanced confidence in the health of the IT estate, with none of the traditionally associated internal resource effort. Are looking for VMware support from UK-based, security cleared, UK nationals, ensuring data integrity and compliance even in the most challenging of environments.
