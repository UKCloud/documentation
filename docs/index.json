    "keywords": "How to migrate from N3 to HSCN Note You can migrate your UKCloud environments from N3 to HSCN regardless of whether your end user environments have migrated to HSCN. The HSCN-to-N3 gateway ensures a free-flow of traffic between the two networks. One consideration is the customer firewalls, which would need to be amended to allow traffic to/from the new HSCN IPs provided by UKCloud, regardless of whether the end customer locations are on N3 or HSCN; you can find more information below. Overview As of March 2019, NHS Digital will be decommissioning the N3 network, replacing it with the new Health and Social Care Network (HSCN). As a result, UKCloud will be decommissioning our N3 connectivity in January 2019 and users of the N3 network on our platform must migrate their workloads to the HSCN network by then. The two networks (N3 and HSCN) will run in parallel to enable all our customers to migrate off the N3 network. Our migration strategy from N3 to HSCN will migrate all the services in a single VDC/project at the same time. An alternative option enables you to migrate individual workloads one at a time, but this will require considerably more configuration on your side. Traffic can traverse the N3 and HSCN networks, so any services on N3 will be able to access HSCN and vice versa. UKCloud changes With the migration to HSCN, there are a few changes to the way UKCloud will present the HSCN network to our customers. Unlike existing N3 connections for VMware in regions 1 and 2, HSCN addresses will be presented directly down to your VMware edges. This enables you to have more visibility and control over the your assigned HSCN IP addresses. The addresses will be visible on your edges within vCloud, and you'll be able to create your own NAT and firewall rules against these addresses. For VMware and OpenStack customers in Regions 5 and 6, HSCN addresses will be presented to your edges in the same way as your existing N3 connectivity. Your allocated HSCN addresses for the HSCN network will be different from those you used on the N3 network. If you've previously purchased your own N3 addresses and brought them onto the UKCloud platform, raise a service request via the UKCloud Portal to discuss this further. VMware migration plan The following information outlines the migration process set by UKCloud to facilitate moving your VMware services from N3 to HSCN. Migration overview When you request a migration, UKCloud will deploy an HSCN edge gateway into your N3 connected VDCs. The required number of HSCN IP addresses will be assigned to this edge. You can then perform testing over the HSCN network in preparation for your migration. When you've completed your testing, you have the following two options: Option 1: UKCloud will remove the HSCN test edge and then apply the HSCN interface to the existing N3 edge, with the HSCN IPs you were assigned during testing or Option 2: You retain the HSCN edge you used for testing and connect all of your N3 VMs to it You can create a VM free of charge for testing HSCN connectivity for one month from the date you were provided with the HSCN edge. You can continue testing for longer than a month, however you'll be charged for the VM after the initial month. You should inform UKCloud of the VMs used for HSCN connectivity so that these can be excluded from billing. While both options do require you to make changes in your configuration yourself, Option 1 is the easier method of migration. See the instructions below for more details. Option 1: Add an HSCN interface to the existing N3 edge If you choose this option, UKCloud will add an HSCN interface to your existing N3 edge and assign the same HSCN IP addresses you've been using as part of your testing. The newly built HSCN edge will be removed from the VDC prior to this to allow for the IP addresses to be added to the N3 edge. At the time of migration, UKCloud will change the default gateway of the edge to route via the HSCN interface rather than the N3 interface. Adding an HSCN interface: UKCloud actions When you confirm that you're ready to begin testing HSCN connectivity in preparation for your migration, UKCloud will deploy an HSCN edge gateway into the N3-connected VDC. When you confirm that your testing is complete, UKCloud will delete the new HSCN edge and add an HSCN interface to the existing N3 edge.The HSCN IP addresses used for testing will be moved to the old N3 edge. At the time of migration, UKCloud will change the default gateway of the edge to route via the HSCN interface. When you confirm that your new services are successfully working on HSCN, UKCloud will then remove the N3 interface from the edge and update any references of N3 to HSCN, for example, edge names. You'll then stop being billed for N3 connectivity. Adding an HSCN interface: Customer actions When you're ready to begin testing on the HSCN network, log a service request with UKCloud to deploy an HSCN Edge into your environment. Create an Org VDC network and connect any required VMs to perform testing. Important UKCloud highly recommends creating new vApps and VMs for HSCN testing purposes. When removing the HSCN edge after testing has been completed, any vApps that have been connected to the HSCN edge will need to be powered off for the edge to successfully be deleted. Perform any required testing to ensure that after the migration, all services will work successfully over HSCN rather than N3. When you've completed your testing and UKCloud have added the HSCN interface to the N3 edge, you'll need to add new HSCN NAT and firewall rules to the N3 edge (in a DISABLED state, so that the running N3 service is not affected). You may also need to amend operating system firewalls. Important Due to less traffic restrictions being blocked by UKCloud on the HSCN network, it is your responsibility to block or permit traffic on your edge firewalls. At the time of migration, you should disable any NAT or firewall rules that are no longer required and enable the newly created HSCN NAT and firewall rules. UKCloud will change the default gateway of the edge and you should perform further testing to ensure that your services are working successfully post migration on the HSCN network. Option 2: A new HSCN edge You can continue to use the HSCN edge that UKCloud deploys into your N3-connected VDCs for testing to connect your VMs to the HSCN network. This option requires you to perform a considerable amount of reconfiguration. Regions 1 & 2 – Internet Connectivity If you currently have internet connectivity in your VDC via the N3 enabled edge, the way this works will change after the migration. Both options provided above are still applicable and can still be used to migrate from N3 to HSCN, however there are some slight changes and some additional steps required in order to maintain your internet connectivity. Please find the additional steps below: Option 1: Add an HSCN interface to the existing N3 edge If you chose Option 1 for your migration strategy, the following steps are required to maintain internet connectivity: After the migration, your edge will be left with 2 interfaces; one for internet connectivity and one for HSCN connectivity. You can decide which interface is used as the default gateway; Internet or HSCN. Depending on your decision, static routes will need to be configured on the edge to route any traffic for the other connectivity type via the additional interface. Example: If you decide that the default gateway of the edge should route via the internet interface, you will need to configure static routes on the edge for any HSCN addresses you wish to connect to, to route via the HSCN interface. Important When applying static routes to your edge, these must not conflict with any of your internal ranges. If so, when routing internally, internal traffic could be routed externally to the edge. Option 2: A new HSCN edge If you chose Option 2 for your migration strategy, your internet connectivity and HSCN connectivity will be configured on two different edges. Whereas in the original Option 2 above, your previous N3 edge is removed from your environment after the migration, if you require Internet connectivity in your VDC, this edge will not be deleted. N3 access via this edge will be removed so that it can solely be used for Internet connectivity. Depending on the connectivity types required on each of your VMs, it may be required for you to configure two NICs; one for HSCN and one for internet connectivity. The routing table within the OS will also need to be configured to route traffic out of the correct NIC as well. New HSCN edge: UKCloud actions When you confirm that you're ready to begin testing HSCN connectivity in preparation for your migration, UKCloud will deploy an HSCN edge gateway into the N3-connected VDC. New HSCN edge: Customer actions When you're ready to begin testing on the HSCN network, log a service request with UKCloud to deploy an HSCN edge into your environment. Create an Org VDC network connected the HSCN edge and connect any VMs to perform testing to ensure that after the migration, all services will work successfully over HSCN rather than N3. Important UKCloud highly recommends creating new vApps and VMs for HSCN testing purposes. When you've completed your testing, connect the required VMs to the HSCN Org VDC network. This will require adding additional NICs to each of the VMs. You'll also need to amend the routing table on each of the VMs to route any N3 and HSCN traffic out of the HSCN interface. Apply any required firewall and NAT rules on the HSCN edge, and amend any operating system firewalls. Inform UKCloud that the migration is complete. UKCloud will then remove N3 access from the environment and stop any billing for N3 connectivity. OpenStack migration plan UKCloud will give you access to an HSCN network in your OpenStack project and assign you the same number of HSCN addresses as you have on N3. OpenStack migration plan: UKCloud actions UKCloud will perform these required tasks prior to the migration. These tasks will not cause any disruption to your existing service. UKCloud will add the HSCN network to your OpenStack project. UKCloud will allocate you the same number of HSCN addresses as you have on N3 (addresses will be pre-allocated). OpenStack migration plan: Customer actions Examine all security groups to ensure that they'll only permit the required access via the HSCN networks. Add an HSCN router, connect it to the correct networks (for example, the same networks that have a connection to the N3 router) and add any required routes to the new HSCN router (equivalent to the existing N3 router). To test HSCN, add a new network connected to the HSCN router and build an instance on that network containing the tools and applications that can be used to confirm the connectivity requirements for your production platform. Important UKCloud highly recommends creating new instances for HSCN testing purposes. When the migration is due to start, perform the following for each instance: Add an HSCN address to the instance as a floating IP (only for instances that currently have a N3 floating IP). When appropriate, remove the N3 floating IP from the instance. When appropriate, change the default gateway in each instance to point to the HSCN router rather than the N3 router. When the migration is completed, disconnect the old N3 router from all networks and edit the subnets for all the networks such that the HSCN router is used as default gateway for new instances. When you've confirmed functionality on HSCN, disconnect the old N3 router from all networks and delete the N3 router. Inform UKCloud that the migration is complete. UKCloud will then remove N3 access from the project and stop any billing for N3 connectivity. HSCN firewall implementation UKCloud will be replacing the existing N3 firewalls with new next-generation firewall devices for the HSCN network. UKCloud will not be blocking any ports but will have IDS, IPS and malware detection running across all ports as directed by NHS Digital. If you encounter any issues with legitimate packets being dropped or blocked, raise a service request so we can investigate, and if needed, update the next generation firewall rules. Note You should ensure that your firewall rules are suitable for controlling all traffic traversing them, and should not rely on UKCloud to control traffic to your environments. Additional changes The above steps are changes that need to be made to be able to connect your VMs to the HSCN network. You may also need to perform additional steps to migrate your services to the HSCN network including DNS changes and any changes at an application level. As UKCloud does not have visibility at this level, it is your responsibility to identify any additional steps required. UKCloud can help as and where required if the request is within scope of our service. NHS Digital guidance on DNS changes To request a DNS change, email dnsteam@nhs.net with following information: Domains that you want to change Old IP address(es) New IP address(es) Date and time of change We recommend giving NHS Digital a couple of days lead time as there may be scheduling issues, though these can be waived in emergencies. Note IP changes are NOT instantaneous and may take some time to propagate fully. NHS Digital can do out-of-hours changes for NHS customers. UKCloud services UKCloud's public services are currently presented on N3 and HSCN. You will need to amend VM host files to re-point to the HSCN IPs of any shared services you use when you migrate from N3 to HSCN. A list of the shared service IPs is available within the UKCloud Portal here: https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/notifications/472 (UKCloud Portal log in required) Note These services will be removed from the N3 on 8th October. You'll need to amend your firewall rules and host files so you can continue to reach these services when we've migrated these services to HSCN. As HSCN is routable from N3, if you're currently still on N3 you'll be able to reach these services if you amend your N3 firewall and host files with the HSCN IPs. Cloud Storage Cloud Storage is now available on HSCN. The NHS DNS records for this service will be migrated from N3 to HSCN IPs on 7th December 2018. If you rely on the NHS DNS service to interact with the Cloud Storage then you'll need to update your firewall and host file records to continue to use this service after this date. HSCN-connected Cloud Storage has the following URLs and IPs: -Farnborough: cas.frn00006.ukcloud.thirdparty.nhs.uk – 10.200.82.4 -Corsham: cas.cor00005.ukcloud.thirdparty.nhs.uk – 10.200.83.4 Next steps For more information about HSCN, see the HSCN connectivity FAQs .

    "title": "General connectivity FAQs | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "General connectivity FAQs What options do I have to connect to my solution hosted on the UKCloud Assured OFFICIAL (previously PGA IL2) cloud platform? The UKCloud Assured OFFICAL cloud platform previously achieved CESG Pan Government Accreditation (PGA) and is PSN accredited to host OFFICIAL data (including OFFICIAL SENSITIVE) which is accessible via the internet or the PSN service. You can also connect via internet, HSCN and Janet dependant on relevant accreditation. Our Assured OFFICAL cloud platform follows best commercial practice, so certain insecure traffic types are restricted. In general, it's good practice to connect to your Assured OFFICIAL solution via an IPsec VPN (using commercial-grade encryption) which you configure via your self-managed virtual firewall. Within the VPN tunnel, you can use any protocol, giving you maximum flexibility. You can also configure your solution to allow other traffic encrypted using SSL or TLS. Use of non-encrypted traffic should be minimised. As our Assured OFFICIAL cloud platform is PSN accredited, you can also connect to your solution via our resilient and scalable PSN service connections. Alternatively, you can use HybridConnect options by, for example, installing your own CAS(T)-compliant private circuit. Can I connect to my solution using SSL VPN? Our Assured OFFICAL and Elevated OFFICAL cloud platforms both support SSL VPN (configured by UKCloud via a Service Request), but we don't recommend it other than for occasional remote administration purposes by a small number of administrators. If you need more extensive use of SSL VPN, we recommend you deploy a dedicated VPN appliance, such as OpenVPN. Can I use UKCloud as a transit or gateway between different connections? No. Our cloud platforms are designed so that all traffic either originates or terminates within our platform. We can't facilitate routing between connections. If your solution needs to service users on different networks, this will need to be implemented, managed and accredited within your application or an authorised gateway service. Do you provide an SLA on internet/PSN/HSCN/Janet connectivity? We provide an SLA for availability of our core services such as UKCloud for VMware. We cannot provide an SLA on external services as they are outside our control. UKCloud can only provide assurance associated with the native SLAs that are offered as part of the core PSN framework. Why doesn't the UKCloud SLA extend to external connectivity such as PSN and the internet? The UKCloud SLA provides our customers with assurance that our platform is designed, engineered and operated to deliver high levels of availability and uptime. We have invested in skilled and experienced people, ISO 20000-certified IT service management processes and best-in-class technology - all of which underpin our cloud services and allow us to deliver high availability. When it comes to external connectivity, we depend on services provided by third parties. In some cases (such as PSN, Janet and HSCN), we have no choice about which connectivity provider to work with, as this is mandated by the government framework. These services are available only as managed connections, so our SLA can only extend to the inside interface of the managed router deployed and maintained by the third party. Although we work closely with third-party providers to engineer a highly available solution, the actual delivery of the service is not within our control. For more open networks such as the internet, we use multiple connectivity providers to further mitigate the impact of a service failure on the part an individual connectivity provider. Even so, failure scenarios can still occur beyond the UKCloud boundary, which can affect the service that customers receive (for example, congestion on the internet, localised failures within the provider's network or their peering agreement). We plan to introduce secondary PSN connectivity providers to implement similar resilience but, as PSN services are delivered as managed connections, we cannot directly control the PSN routers. What is your policy on IP addressing? We've designed our cloud to give you complete control and autonomy over the private ( RFC 1918 ) IP address space you deploy within your virtual data centre (VDC). You can use the self-managed virtual firewall to implement a VPN tunnel, network address translation (NAT) and load balancing to control how you publish the services within your VDC to external networks. For the UKCloud Assured OFFICIAL cloud platform, we allocate at least five usable RIPE IPv4 addresses which are fully routable on the internet. With these addresses, you can establish: Source NAT - all outbound traffic to other resources on the internet will appear to come from one of these IPv4 addresses. Destination NAT - all inbound traffic from other resources on the internet must be targeted at one of these IPv4 addresses. You can translate the internet IPv4 address to an internal (RFC 1918) IP address assigned to a virtual machine (VM) or, preferably, to the edge gateway load balancer. A VPN - an IPsec VPN can be established between the IPv4 address of the virtual firewall and the IPv4 address of the firewall at another site. Once the VPN has been established, both sites can directly access the internal (RFC 1918) IP addresses. For PSN connections to either of our cloud platforms, the PSN Authority has provided us with a limited allocation of PSN IP addresses . The PSN Authority requires customers who need more than a few PSN IP addresses to use their own PSN IP allocation and, if more are needed, to justify an additional allocation directly with the PSN Authority. UKCloud will work with customers to facilitate the allocation of their PSN IP addresses to their services hosted on our cloud platforms. With the PSN IP addresses, you can establish: Source NAT - all outbound traffic to other resources on the PSN will appear to come from one of these IPv4 addresses. Destination NAT - all inbound traffic from other resources on the PSN must be targeted at one of these IPv4 addresses. You can translate the PSN IPv4 address to an internal (RFC 1918) IP address assigned to a VM or, preferably, to the edge gateway load balancer. A VPN - an IPsec VPN can be established between the IPv4 address of the virtual firewall and the IPv4 address of the firewall at another site. Once the VPN has been established, both sites can directly access the internal (RFC 1918) IP addresses. As both PSN and RIPE IPv4 addresses are in short supply, you must use your addresses as efficiently as possible. Before additional IPv4 addresses can be allocated, you'll need to demonstrate your use of: Load balancing services - enabling a number of web servers to be accessed via a single externally routable IP address Host headers - enabling web servers to accept connections for a number of URLs via a single externally routable IP address VPN tunnelling - enabling the use of internal (RFC 1918) IP addresses for non-production services such as UAT and development Can additional purchased IP addresses be transferred to another VDC? As long as the original VDC is being removed, purchased IP addresses can be transferred to another VDC on the same account. Other scenarios must be discussed with UKCloud. How do I remotely manage my solution hosted on UKCloud? Your cloud solution is designed to be self-managed via the UKCloud Portal or programmatically via a fully documented API. The Portal and API enable you to configure your VDC including the virtual firewall, load balancer, site-to-site VPNs, networks and VMs. You can deploy and manage operating systems and applications using the Portal's remote console function (Windows and Linux only). You can also configure your virtual firewall to allow direct remote management of each VM independent of the Portal or API, for example via IPsec VPNs or SSH. Using a VPN lets you connect directly to each VM using tools such as Remote Desktop, SSH or other management clients. When will UKCloud offer IPv6 addresses? We continue to work with our service providers and technology partners to ensure our platform is ready for IPv6 addressing. How are the two UKCloud data centres connected? UKCloud operates high-bandwidth (multi-Gigabit), low-latency (typically sub-5ms round-trip time) dark fibre connectivity between our two data centres. It's highly resilient as it takes diverse northerly and southerly routes. This data centre interconnectivity is highly scalable, as spare fibre capacity is in place to meet future demand. It uses CAS(T) compliant circuits; and within our Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform, we provide additional overlay encryption using a CPA-approved solution. These have previously achieved Pan Government Accreditation and are PSN accredited to carry OFFICIAL data (including OFFICIAL SENSITIVE), as well as the PSN service. If I have reserved bandwidth, how do I uplift this? We actively monitor and manage our connections to ensure there is appropriate connectivity to the platform. Customers looking to provide 'guaranteed' connection capacity should include a HybridConnect leased line in their solution. Can UKCloud help me if I don't have a suitable connection for the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform? We recognise that some customers may be affected by the often extended lead times associated with provisioning new connections suitable for the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform; and that some customers may not have adequate bandwidth to handle bulk import/export activities. To help address these issues, we offer two options: A chargeable Data Transfer Facility which enables you to access the Elevated platform and carry out import/export activities from our secure office. Although you can bring your data/media into our office and benefit from our readily available and suitably accredited connections to the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform for large quantities of data, we recommend the use of the Mass Transfer Facility A chargeable Mass Transfer Facility which enables you to send in HDDs or a populated NAS box which can then be uploaded to your cloud environment. This is aimed at customers with large amounts of data to be uploaded which can be done by authorised UKCloud staff. If you're interested in either of these services, please contact our sales team to discuss your requirements. How do I configure my solution to use the UKCloud data centre interconnection? This depends on the use case. If you have a VDC in each UKCloud data centre: Configure an IPsec VPN between the edge gateway instances of each VDC. Once the VPN has been established, VMs within the VDC can connect to each another using their private (RFC 1918) IP addresses. If you have VMs in one UKCloud data centre which need to access published services in the other (for example, VMs hosted in DC1 might choose to access Cloud Storage in DC2): The service (for example, our Cloud Storage) will be published using an accessible hostname/IP address. The service should be published on standard ports (for example, HTTP). You simply configure your VMs to connect to the published hostname/IP over the standard ports. If your private circuits or co-located equipment need to use the data centre interconnection: Contact your account manager, as this will be a non-standard solution which may require support from our technical specialists (costs will be as per the SFIA rate card). Does UKCloud support RLI connections? Yes, UKCloud does support an RLI connection for customers who have been already authorised by the MoD. We will then us the HybridConnect service to connect the RLI network to your cloud environment. If I have an MPLS circuit direct into UKCloud, do I still have to go through a PSN connection to access the Elevated Portal? No, you don't need a PSN connection as you can access the Portal from within a VM on the Elevated platform. Are external Domain Name System (DNS) services available? No, we don't currently offer this service. Customers can implement their own DNS servers within their solution, or configure their virtual firewall to enable connectivity to an externally hosted DNS server (for example, those hosted on Government Secure Networks such as PSN, or those available on the internet such as Google 8.8.8.8). Does UKCloud support Janet connectivity? Yes, UKCloud provides a Janet connection provided free for our customers. In order to utilise this network, you will need to be authorised by Jisc. There is no inbound or outbound usage charge for using the Janet connection to access the UKCloud platform. Is there a bandwidth restriction on a VRF? Like all our connectivity options, there is no set bandwidth cap on our VRFs, and we will capacity manage our VRF network in order to ensure our customers can consume as much as required, however we do operate a Networks Fair Use Policy which protects all our users of the networks from being impacted by particularly spiky/unpredictable network loads. To that end, if a customer thinks that they will use large amounts of bandwidth we always appreciate a heads-up so we can proactively increase bandwidth of the network in order to avoid having to lean on any policy to protect all our users. Outside of the VRF, customers may need to consider the impact of things such as IPSec VPN tunnels over the VRF, which decrease the bandwidth of the network because of Edge throughput limits.

    "title": "Emergency Services Network FAQs | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Emergency Services Network FAQs What is the Emergency Services Network (ESN)? The ESN is a network based on 4G that will enable communications between emergency services. It will replace the current radio-based system that has been in operation since 2004. Who is responsible for the ESN? EE are responsible for providing the 4G network and Motorola are providing all the equipment and Data Centres that are connected to the ESN. Vodafone are also responsible for the provision of a Direct Network Service Provider (DNSP), the last-mile connectivity from the EE Points of Presence, each control room and every police, fire and ambulance station. How does the ESN work? EE are currently upgrading their entire network to 4G and the ESN will share the same networking space as commercial mobile traffic, however Emergency services will have a quality of service priority over EE's 4G network. During an emergency, EE will prioritise emergency service traffic to allow for a better quality of service in the localised area of the emergency. When is the ESN going live? ESN is predicted to go live by the end of 2018. Can UKCloud connect directly into the ESN? No. Motorola states there is no way to do this directly due to the levels of SLA needed on the network. Any connection to the ESN must be within the Motorola data centre and will have to go through a strict vetting process to be allowed onto the ESN. There is potential for us to connect indirectly in the future, however it would most likely be through the PSN or the DNSP. How can my application interface with blue-light organisations? Almost all blue-light applications will still connect to end-customers through normal government networks (PSN, HSCN) or internet (as this service is not replacing them), with the exception of specific applications which will be pushed to Motorola devices using ESN.

    "keywords": "How to use file browsers with Cloud Storage Overview UKCloud's Cloud Storage service is an object storage solution based on Dell EMC Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS). Access is via a RESTful application programming interface (API). Web applications can easily interact with the API, but the ability to browse the contents of the storage using a graphical client can be useful, as it provides a user friendly interface to the storage. This enables, for example: Verification by developers that their applications or scripts work as intended with the storage Bulk import or export of content by users Easy maintenance and housekeeping of the objects in the storage system ECS provides two APIs that you can use to manage Cloud Storage: the S3 compatible API and the EMC ECS Atmos API. Note If you write content to Cloud Storage using one of the APIs, you cannot subsequently access that content using the other API. Choose carefully which API you want to use before beginning a project, as it will be difficult to move between them. In this article, we'll look at some of the many applications that enable you to browse an object storage system. We'll look at two categories: Windows applications Internet browser access The inclusion of applications in this article should not be taken as an endorsement or recommendation of them by UKCloud. However, we have tested them with our Cloud Storage service and verified that they work correctly. API endpoints Cloud Storage provides different API endpoints to access your storage, depending on the UKCloud site and connectivity type you are using. Make sure you use the correct endpoint to ensure the best possible performance for your solution. S3 API endpoints: Corsham (Assured) Internet: cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com PSN Assured: cas.cor00005.psnassured.ukcloud.com HSCN: cas.cor00005.ukcloud.thirdparty.nhs.uk/ Farnborough (Assured) Internet: cas.frn00006.ukcloud.com PSN Assured: cas.frn00006.psnassured.ukcloud.com HSCN: cas.frn00006.ukcloud.thirdparty.nhs.uk/ Contact UKCloud support if you are unsure which endpoint to use. Windows applications This section takes you through installing and configuring two applications: Cyberduck and S3 Browser. Cyberduck Cyberduck is an open source cross platform file browser for HTTP based object storage solutions. It utilises the S3 endpoints to establish connectivity with the ECS platform over HTTPS. To install and configure Cyberduck: Download Cyberduck . Install Cyberduck using either the default settings or specifying your own configuration. Download the Cloud Storage Cyberduck profile . Note If you download this profile using a browser, ensure the file name is .cyberduckprofile . Browse to the downloaded file and double click to open it. Complete the fields in the new connection dialog box: Ensure you enter the correct endpoint in the Server field, as shown in API endpoints The Access Key ID is your User ID, which you can find in the Storage section of the UKCloud Portal When you're done, click the x icon to close the dialog box You can see the new connection in the Cyberduck UI. Right-click the connection and select Connect to server . In the Login dialog box, in the Secret Access Key field, enter your Cloud Storage secret key. If you've forgotten or don't know your secret key, you can reset it in the Storage section of the Portal. Note Unless you want the password to be saved, deselect the Save password check box. After you've authenticated yourself with your secret key, you can view, upload and download files as normal. For additional information, see Connecting to ECS with Cyberduck . S3 Browser S3 Browser is a Windows client for Amazon S3 that you can easily configure to work with the S3 compatible API on Cloud Storage. It’s free for personal use; a licence fee is payable for business use. To install and configure S3 Browser: Download S3 Browser . Execute the installer and follow the prompts in the wizard to complete the installation. The first time you launch S3 Browser, you'll be prompted for your account credentials. Fill in the form with your Cloud Storage credentials: a. From the Account Type list, select S3 Compatible Storage . b. Ensure you enter the correct endpoint in the REST Endpoint field, as shown in API endpoints . c. The Access Key ID is your User ID, which you can find in the Storage section of the Portal. d. The Secret Access Key is your secret key. If you've forgotten or don't know your secret key, you can reset it in the Storage section of the Portal. e. If you're using version 6. x . x of the browser, be sure to select Use secure transfer (SSL/TLS) . This option is not available or necessary for version 5. x . x . When you're done, click Save changes . The application automatically connects to Cloud Storage and displays your buckets (if you have any). For detailed usage instructions, see the documentation available on the S3 Browser web site. Note Not all S3 features are implemented by the ECS S3 compatible API, so some functionality may not work. However, common file operations (create, read, write and delete) all work well. Internet browser access This section takes you through installing and configuring browser access that enables users to browse the contents of Cloud Storage using a web browser. EMC provides an HTML5 application that you can install in your Atmos bucket to generate a URL that enables you to share the bucket with other users who require access to cloud storage. Note If you have multiple buckets under the same endpoint, you can provide access to them all from a single URL. However, if you have multiple buckets hosted in both Cloud Storage regions, you'll need to install the application in both regions and access is via a different URL for each region. S3 extensions are also available for browsers, but none of them include the functionality to customise the server host name, which is a requirement for connecting to Cloud Storage. If we find S3 browser extensions that offer this functionality in the future, we'll update this article. Atmos HTML5 application Note For installation and initial configuration of the Atmos HTML5 application, you will need the following Prerequisite information: Atmos Access Key - in the form of SubtennantID/User Atmos Secret Key - Shared Secret Key A folder within an existing bucket or new bucket to host the GUI files, for example /<bucket_name>/HTML5UI/ or /HTML5UI/ To install and configure the Atmos HTML5 application: Download and extract the Atmos HTML5 application . On Windows: Open a command prompt, navigate to the extracted files and run the following command: upload.bat WebContent\\main.html /<bucket_name>/<optional_path>/ . On Linux: Open a terminal prompt, or from the CLI, navigate to the extracted files and run the following command: upload.sh WebContent\\main.html /<bucket_name>/<optional_path>/ . The installer script will run and prompt for the following information: Atmos host name, which is the UKCloud endpoint URL for your selected storage bucket for example atmos.cas.frn00006.ukcloud.com Atmos port - Enter 443. Atmos UID - Enter your selected storage bucket's Atmos access key for example a554f348g57f48729c0247r9730e29a1/10-10-10-89431b-1 Atmos secret - Enter your selected storage bucket's shared secret key. When you have provided all the required information, the installer will connect to the bucket and upload the files to the requested folder. Once the script has finished, it will output a URL that you should copy to your clipboard and then keep somewhere safe. Enter the generated URL into your browser and, when connecting for the first time, the application will prompt you to specify an account UID and shared secret for the account that you want to access. After you enter the UID and secret, you can test the credentials using the test button. If the test is successful, click OK to add the credentials to the application and you can then access the bucket. If you want to add more cloud storage accounts that are located at the same Cloud Storage endpoint, you can add them to the application using the cog icon in the top right-hand corner. You can now: Browse the buckets and files stored in your account Use the toolbar buttons to upload files Double-click items to download them Access other operations for selected items through the toolbar buttons Next steps This article has shown you how to browse Cloud Storage buckets using various different applications.

    "title": "How to manage Snapshot Protection for your VMs | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to manage Snapshot Protection for your VMs Overview Protection technologies are tools used to enable you to design resilience into your cloud solutions. They protect data and provide you with the ability to recover from system outages - either caused by a disruption to the physical delivery of a service or as a result of corruption of your primary system. The UKCloud platform offers a variety of protection options, including Snapshot Protection. Snapshot Protection automatically takes an image of your virtual machine (VM) every 24 hours and stores the image outside the core platform for either 14 or 28 days, depending on your chosen snapshot retention profile. How does Snapshot Protection work? By default, VMs deployed on the UKCloud platform do not come with any protection services enabled. If you want Snapshot Protection for your VM, you must explicitly add it. When you add Snapshot Protection to a VM, the VM is added to a daily automated backup. Backups are automatically taken for the VM once every 24 hours, sometime between the hours of 2000 and 0800. The status of a VM's backup is reported daily in the UKCloud Portal by 1000, but typically within minutes of the close of the backup window. If you encounter a problem with your VM, raise a Service Request and we can use one of your VM backups to restore the whole VM image to a new VM in your VDC. You can then use this image to restore the VM or restore any required data to your original VM. For more detailed information, see the Snapshot Protection Service Scope . Checking a VM's Snapshot Protection status You can use the UKCloud Portal to see whether a VM uses Snapshot Protection, find out which snapshot retention policy is currently applied to a VM, or check the status of your VM's snapshots. Log in to the UKCloud Portal. For more detailed steps, see the Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal . If necessary, switch to the account that the VM belongs to. Click My VMs . Select the compute service (vOrg) that the VM belongs to. Select the My VMs tab. From the Currently viewing for VDC list, select the VDC that the VM belongs to. Click the VMs tab. The icon in VM Backup column shows the status of each VM's most recent backup: Icon Description Backup of the VM was successful The VM has been excluded from backups A backup has not yet been created for a VM that has recently been included in backups Backup of the VM was unsuccessful The VM has been excluded from backups but has not yet reached the end of the previous retention period (when the end retention period is reached, the icon will change to the grey minus sign) Tip You can hover over the icon to see a description of the backup status. The button in the Default Policy column shows the Snapshot Protection option currently applied to the VM: 14‑day - VM uses Snapshot Protection, with backups retained for 14 days 28-day - VM uses Snapshot Protection, with backups retained for 28 days Manage - VM is currently excluded from Snapshot Protection Processing - A change in status to Snapshot Protection is currently being processed for the VM Failed - A change in the status of Snapshot Protection for the VM failed; contact the UKCloud support team to resolve this issue. To find out more detail about the most recent backup of a VM, or to view information about previous backups, click the VM Name . In the VMs Info page, the following fields provide information about the most recent backup of the VM: Additional information - additional information about the backup, for example if the backup was removed from the daily automated backup, if the retention period was changed, or further details of any failures. Last backup - the status of the most recent backup Retention length - how long the backup will be kept for: 14 days or 28 days Backup status - when the most recent backup was attempted The Snapshot Protection Backups section of the page provides information about previous backups. This covers the entire retention policy period (14 or 28 days). Information includes: Status - the status of the backup Slot - the backup slot during which the backup was taken Start - the date and time when the backup started End - the date and time when the backup ended Snapshot Removal Start - the date and time when the snapshot consolidation process started (that is, writing back any changes to the VM that occurred during the time it was locked for backup) Snapshot Removal End - the date and time when the snapshot consolidation process ended The Snapshot Protection Policy History section of the page lists any recent changes to the snapshot retention policy for the VM. Status - The status of the policy change Date Requested - The date and time when the policy change was requested User - The user who requested the change Protection Period - The new protection period introduced by the policy change Reason for Change - The reason for the policy change Action - The type of policy change request Click Manage my Backups to raise a service request related to your backups, for example, to restore a backup. To view all the VM information in a single table, click the Actions tab and select Export VMs . You can save this page to view offline and analyse further. Managing Snapshot Protection for a VM By default, VMs deployed on the UKCloud platform do not come with any protection services enabled. You can use the UKCloud Portal to add Snapshot Protection to your VM. You can also use the Portal to change the snapshot retention policy for your backups and to remove Snapshot Protection from your VM. Access the My VMs tab for your compute service. For detailed steps for how to do this, see the first few steps in Checking a VM's snapshot status . From the Currently viewing for VDC list, select the VDC that the VM belongs to. Click the VMs tab. In the Default Policy column, click the green button. The label on the button will depend on the currently applied policy: Manage if there is currently no snapshot retention policy applied to the VM 14-day if the VM's snapshot retention policy is currently 14 days 28-day if the VM's snapshot retention policy is currently 28 days In the Snapshot Protection Policy dialog box, from the New Protection Policy list, select the snapshot retention policy that you want to apply to the VM: 14-day to apply a 14-day snapshot retention policy to the VM 28-day to apply a 28-day snapshot retention policy to the VM No Backup to turn Snapshot Protection off for the VM Note If you remove Snapshot Protection from a VM, you should consider alternatives to ensure the integrity of your data in the case of disruption. In addition to Snapshot Protection, UKCloud offers Journaling Protection options, or you may want to implement your own protection solution, possibly utilising our Cloud Storage service. In the Reason For Change field, provide a reason for the change to the existing snapshot retention policy. Click Submit . The button in the Snapshot Protection column changes to an amber Processing button. When the changes have been applied, the button changes back to green with a label indicating the VM's snapshot retention policy ( 14-day or 28-day ) or Manage if you have turned off Snapshot Protection. The amount of time it takes for your changes to take place depends on how many requests are in the queue. If there are any problems with the request, the button in the Snapshot Protection column changes to a red Failed button; in this situation, contact UKCloud Support for further assistance. Backup status information is updated daily on the UKCloud Portal by 1000, but typically within minutes of the close of the backup window. Note If you remove a VM from backups, the status icon for the VM will display as a red cross until the end of the previously selected retention period. When the end of the retention period is reached, the status icon will change to the grey minus sign. Managing Snapshot Protection for a VDC You can specify a snapshot retention policy to apply to all the VMs in a VDC. You can apply the policy to all new VMs or to all new and existing VMs. Access the My VMs tab for your compute service. For detailed steps for how to do this, see the first few steps in Checking a VM's snapshot status . From the Currently viewing for VDC list, select the VDC that you want to apply Snapshot Protection to. Select the Snapshot Protection tab. Next to Default VM Snapshot Protection , click the green button. The label on the button will depend on the currently applied policy: Manage if there is currently no default snapshot retention policy applied to the VDC 14-day if the default snapshot retention policy is currently 14 days 28-day if the default snapshot retention policy is currently 28 days In the Snapshot Protection Policy dialog box, from the New Protection Policy list, select the snapshot retention policy that you want to apply to the VMs in this VDC: 14-day if you want to apply a 14-day snapshot retention policy to the VDC 28-day if you want to apply a 28-day snapshot retention policy to the VDC No Backup if you do not want to apply a default snapshot retention policy to the VDC In the Reason For change field, provide a reason for the change to the existing snapshot retention policy. If you want to apply the chosen snapshot retention policy to existing VMs in the VDC as well as new VMs, select the Apply new policy to all existing VMs? check box. Note If you select this check box, all existing VMs will switch to the new policy when you click Submit. You will not be able to rollback this change. Click Submit . The label of the Default VM Snapshot Protection button changes to indicate the new snapshot retention policy ( 14-day or 28-day ) or to Manage if you have turned off Snapshot Protection. Any new VMs created within the VDC will now use the specified snapshot retention policy, although you can override this for individual VMs if required by following the steps in Managing snapshot protection for a VM . If you selected Apply to all existing VMs , the button changes to an amber Processing button. When the changes have been applied, the button changes back to green with a label indicating the VDC's snapshot retention policy ( 14-day or 28-day ) or Manage if you have turned off Snapshot Protection. If the VDC contains a lot of VMs, the process of updating the policy for all existing VMs may take several minutes to complete. Backup status information is updated daily on the UKCloud Portal by 1000, but typically within minutes of the close of the backup window. Note When you exit the Snapshot Protection Policy dialog box, the Currently viewing for VDC list on the My VMs tab resets to the first VDC listed under the compute service. You'll need to reselect your VDC from the list before continuing. The Default Snapshot Protection Policy History section of the page lists any recent changes to the snapshot protection policy for the VDC. The Recent VM Snapshot Protection Policy Actions section of the page lists any recent changes to the snapshot protection policy for VMs in the VDC. Monitoring the status of Snapshot Protection You can monitor the status of Snapshot Protection across an entire compute service to get a general overview of how your VDCs and VMs are protected. Log in to the UKCloud Portal. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud Portal . If necessary, switch to the account that the compute service belongs to. In the navigation panel, expand Reports and click Backup Summary . Click the link for the compute service for which you want to view Snapshot Protection information. The Snapshot Protection Summary page provides the following information for the selected compute service: Success Rate (Last 24 Hours) - The percentage of successful VM backups in the previous night's backups Success Rate (Within Retention Period) - The overall percentage success rate of all backups across the compute service Number of VMs Protected - The total number of VMs successfully protected in the previous night's backups Number of VMs Not Protected - The total number of VMs with Snapshot Protection that were not successfully protected in the previous night's backups VM Snapshot Protection Failures - A list of the VMs that encountered a Snapshot Protection failure in previous night's backups Next steps For more information about working with your VMs, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware .

    "title": "How to license Microsoft applications/software on the UKCloud platform | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to licence Microsoft applications/software on the UKCloud platform Overview Important It is your responsibility to ensure that you have a valid licence for any software installed on the UKCloud platform if applicable. This guide is designed to provide information on how Microsoft licensing can be applied on our platform and the options available to you. UKCloud offer two ways to licence Microsoft software for use on our compute platform, providing you with the flexibility you need to deliver your application workloads in line with Microsoft requirements and obligations. These are for UKCloud to purchase these licences monthly for you, or for you to submit a Microsoft Licence Mobility Verification form if you intend to use your own existing licensing. Microsoft Server licensing To make the provisioning of Microsoft-based virtual machines (VMs) as simple and quick as possible, while remaining in line with our Microsoft agreement, all Microsoft Server licences must be provided by UKCloud. The standard licensing approach is for us to provide Microsoft Windows Server licences on a per hour basis. This is retrospectively billed based on your usage of an associated VM. Please note that it is not possible for you to bring your own Microsoft Windows Server licences for use on the UKCloud platform. For your Microsoft Windows Server‑based VMs to use a UKCloud-purchased licence, you must create all your Microsoft VMs using a Microsoft template from the UKCloud product catalogue. If you prefer to create your Microsoft VMs using your own template, you must then register these VMs with our Key Management Server (KMS). A document is available on the UKCloud Knowledge Centre to explain how this is done. The Microsoft Windows Server licence is invoiced each month, in addition to the cost of the VM, based on the VM's usage. We automatically bill the usage of Microsoft Windows Server per hour that the VM is powered on, and invoice you for your consumption of Microsoft Windows Server per month using the following pricing table for G-Cloud 10: VM size SPLA Per hour per VM Academic Per hour per VM Micro, Tiny VM £0.012 £0.002 Small VM £0.023 £0.003 Medium VM, Medium High Memory £0.046 £0.007 Large VM, Large High Memory, Tier One Apps £0.135 £0.020 Due to the elimination of the discount for G-SPLA, there is now price parity with corporate SPLA. As a result, customers who may not have previously been applicable for G-SPLA are not impacted. Microsoft desktop licensing While we do not offer the option of supplying Microsoft Desktop Operating System licensing, we are now an authorised partner on the Qualified MultiTenant Hoster (QMTH) program. The QMTH program enables you to purchase Microsoft 10 Enterprise licences, and use these on our multi-tenant cloud platform. Important You must inform Microsoft by completing a Microsoft Licence Mobility Verification form for the licensing to be valid. For more information regarding the QMTH program, we have further details on the UKCloud web site If you want to use this option, raise a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal, detailing the VM names. In addition, you can also bring your own Microsoft desktop licensing for use on a dedicated single tenant cloud server such as Private Cloud for Compute. In this instance, contact your Account Director or Technical Account Manager for further information. Options for all other Microsoft applications As stated, all Microsoft applications on the UKCloud platform must be licensed appropriately by either UKCloud or by using your own existing licensing. There are two options available to you: UKCloud's Microsoft licensing and usage billing. The standard licensing approach is for us to provide Microsoft licences on a per hour or monthly basis depending on the application. These are retrospectively billed based on your usage of an associated VM for each month. For this option to be valid, you must ensure that you have informed us of all Microsoft installations by raising a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal, detailing the VM names, the application and specific version/level. Please note that not all applications are available using this option, and the Microsoft application list within this document will state the eligibility of this option per application. Bring your own Microsoft licensing. If your organisation has an existing SPLA or Academic licensing contract with Microsoft, or if you wish to licence your Microsoft software directly, we can offer the option of your organisation using your own Microsoft software licensing. Note This is only possible with certain Microsoft applications and is not possible for Microsoft Windows Server as stated above. Before you install any Microsoft software onto a UKCloud VM, you must ensure that you purchase the correct licensing with software assurance and that you have completed the Microsoft Licence Mobility Verification process detailed in this document. The completion of the process is identified by a signed confirmation sent to you from Microsoft Ireland. Please note that if you do not have software assurance, you will not be able to use the Microsoft Mobility option. The Microsoft Mobility option involves transferring the use of your licensing to UKCloud VMs, and therefore they cannot be used on other Cloud Service Providers or on your own hardware. However, if you discontinue the use of the application on the UKCloud platform and no longer require the licensing, this can be reverted for your use elsewhere. The Microsoft Mobility form is available on the Microsoft web site. Please note that this must be completed and posted to Microsoft and not to UKCloud. The correct UKCloud partner agreement number to use is 8392716. Microsoft application list The following list is aimed at providing you with a summary regarding the licensing options available to you for each specific application. This summary states whether UKCloud licensing and/or Microsoft Mobility is available. Please note that this is not intended to be a complete list, but covers the most frequently requested applications. If the application you are looking for is not on this list, please engage with your Account Director or Technical Account Manager who will be able to help and advise you as to whether the software can be licensed and if so how. Microsoft SQL You do not need to purchase licensing for MySQL, SQL Express or PostgreSQL. However, if you are using SQL Standard or Enterprise for development purposes you are required by Microsoft to have valid licensing in place. SQL Developer can only be utilised on a shared platform to test the SQL element of a solution and cannot be used to provide end-user services. If you wish to provide SQL services to end-users, SQL Enterprise or SQL Standard must be purchased. We can provide Microsoft SQL Standard Server licences on a per hour basis, or Microsoft SQL Enterprise licences billed on a monthly basis. These are retrospectively billed based on your usage of an associated VM, and the pricing is available within the G10 Service definitions and pricing guide. Microsoft Mobility - this is a valid option for both SQL Standard and Enterprise. Please note that for under SPLA licensing you only need to purchase the SQL server licence and you do not need to purchase Server Access Licences (SAL). Office 365 UKCloud licensing - we are not able to provide Microsoft Office 365 licensing. Microsoft Mobility - this is a valid option for Office 365 ProPlus licences as long as you have valid Software Assurance in place. To take advantage of this option, you must manage your Office 365 implementation and ensure you have the correct number of licences to reflect your user count. This option is available via the QMTH program, and more information is available on the UKCloud web site . Remote Desktop Server Access Licence UKCloud licensing - we are able to provide Microsoft Remote Desktop (RDS) SAL on a monthly basis only. These are retrospectively billed, and the pricing is available within the G10 Service definitions and pricing guide. For these licences to be used, you must raise a service request prior to their use as they will need to be registered on the UKCloud platform and will need to provision a dedicated RDS licence server. To assign and validate the licences, we will need to arrange a session to connect to your server. Microsoft Mobility - this is a valid option for RDS licences. System Center UKCloud licensing - we are currently unable to offer this as standard or at an additional cost due to our current Microsoft Windows Server licences. Microsoft Mobility - as per Microsoft's terms, you can use your own licensing to cover this software as long as you have active software assurance in place. If you have System Center Datacentre licensing in place this can be used on up to 10 VMs on the UKCloud platform. However, if you own a standard licence, this only covers 2 VMs. The licence can be used for High Availability, Disaster Recovery Solutions and vMotion events giving you full autonomy to design solutions with resilience in mind whilst being fully licensed. SharePoint UKCloud licensing - we are not currently able to offer licences for this application. Microsoft Mobility - Sharepoint Server or Sharepoint Server for internet sites can be licensed through Licence Mobility, only if Software Assurance is in place. Once verified by Microsoft you will be able to use the SharePoint software on the UKCloud platform. Office UKCloud licensing - UKCloud can offer SALs for this software. You need to inform us as to how many users will be accessing the application and we will bill you on a per user, per month basis. This pricing is available on request as it is not currently stated in the G10 service definitions or pricing guide. Microsoft Mobility - this is not available via Microsoft Mobility and must be provided by UKCloud. Visual Studio UKCloud licensing - UKCloud can offer licensing for this software. You need to tell us how many users will be accessing the software and we will bill you on a per user, per month basis. Please note the only versions of Visual Studio permitted by Microsoft are Enterprise and Professional. Microsoft Mobility - this is not available via Microsoft Mobility and must be provided by UKCloud. Other Microsoft Products Please engage with your Account Director or Technical Account Manager who will be able to help and advise you as to whether the software can be licensed, and if so, how. Submitting a request to use Microsoft applications on the UKCloud platform You must advise us of your preferred method for licensing Microsoft applications. To use your existing Microsoft licensing or use licences billed by us on UKCloud‑provisioned VMs: Log in to the UKCloud Portal . Select Support , then My Calls . Select Raise a new Support Call . From the How can we help you? list, select I am requesting information on/administration of my service .

I want to bring my own Microsoft licences to my UKCloud environment Once you have selected one of the two options above, you will need to fill out a Request summary and provide the information outlined below: If you have selected I want to bring my own Microsoft licences to my UKCloud environment, you need to state the specific VDC and VMs that contain the software that will be affected by your own licensing. You will also need to state what software, version, and the quantity of licences you will be using. (You must have completed the Microsoft Mobility verification process before choosing this option.) If your Microsoft Mobility application has been accepted, you need to inform us of the date from which your licensing will take effect. If you have selected I want UKCloud to invoice me for the licensing of Microsoft software on one or more VMs , you need to state the specific VDC and VMs that contain the software you wish UKCloud to licence for you. You will also need to state what software licenses, version, the quantity you require, and the date from which you wish the licensing to commence. Note It is your responsibility to inform support when you no longer require the licensing on one or more of the specified VMs. Click Submit . Validation If you request to use your own licensing, let us know when you have submitted the Mobility Verification form and the support team will update our records. As soon as Microsoft confirm with us that the licences are available, your own Microsoft licensing will be utilised. If you were previously using UKCloud-provided SQL licensing, this will be stopped and you will no longer be billed by us for SQL. Microsoft may contact you to confirm that you have the correct number of licences in place to cover the number of Microsoft-based provisioned VMs supplied by UKCloud. Microsoft SQL Server images To install Microsoft SQL Server Standard or Enterprise edition, you can either use your own local images, or we can make an image available to you. To gain access to any images, you must either inform us so that we can bill you for the appropriate usage, or wait until we've received confirmation from Microsoft as per the mobility process. You can request access to images by raising a Service Request in the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. Responsibilities As soon as you have completed the form and the actions have been confirmed, your organisation is responsible for ensuring that there are enough eligible licences to cover the specified Microsoft-based VMs on the UKCloud platform.

As of July 2015, UKCloud implemented an RHUI to provide automatic updates to our Red Hat customers on our Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL security domains. This provides benefits such as the reliable availability of patch updates and Red Hat approved OS templates. This update service replaces the previous repositories, which are no longer updated and were retired on the 31 August 2015. Prerequisites There are two pre-requisites for performing this operation: The host can resolve to the RHUI DNS records (contact Customer Support for the IP addresses and domain names for these records). You can achieve this by configuring an A record on your local DNS, or configuring an /etc/hosts file with the appropriate information. All hosts using the service must be able to access the local RHUA server on port 443 (HTTPS). Ensure that you have configured SNAT and firewall policies on your edge gateway device. If you have any questions on this, contact UKCloud Support. Installation You can find the installer RPM files in the UKCloud public catalog under media , for example, UKCloud-RHUI-Standard-Assured . If you require the high availability (HA) package, raise a Service Request directly via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal and it will be uploaded to your private catalog. Mount the UKCloud RHUI-***.iso to the VM (or place the contents in an accessible location such as NFS share, FTP, and so on). Install the relevant RPM. For example, for RHEL6: rpm -ivh IL2-Client-RHEL6-Standard-2.0-1.noarch.rpm . If you're installing a new RPM, such as replacing standard with HA you need to use the -force flag to overwrite the existing certificates. Clean yum: yum clean all Test the RHUI is working: yum update The first time you update from RHUI you will be prompted to accept the following two certificates: The Red Hat entitlement certificate The Client entitlement certificate Troubleshooting The primary issues you may encounter are: DNS Failure Check the DNS lookup is working and you have the correct entry for Assured and Elevated. 443 not accessible Check your firewall configuration, including local firewalls ( iptables ) and edge gateway. Ensure you have the correct destination IP entry for Assured or Elevated. Incorrect version Ensure you have installed the correct RPM for your release.

    "keywords": "How to create a routed VDC network Overview An organisation virtual data centre network enables its virtual machines (VMs) to communicate with each other or to provide access to external networks. A single VDC can have multiple networks. There are two network flavours, isolated and routed: An isolated (internally connected) network is one that only VMs within the VDC can connect to. Creation of isolated networks is described in How to create an isolated VDC network . A routed network (externally connected) provides access to machines and networks outside the VDC via the edge gateway. You can have up to nine usable routed networks per VDC. This guide describes how to create a routed VDC network. The steps for creating a routed VDC network depend on the version of vCloud Director available in your environment: vCloud Director 8.20 vCloud Director 9.1 Creating a routed VDC network (vCloud Director 8.20) To create a routed VDC network: In vCloud Director, click the Administration tab. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware Double-click the virtual data centre (VDC) that you want to work with, or right-click the VDC and select Open . Select the Org VDC Networks tab. Click the green + icon (or right-click an empty row and select Add Network ) Select the option to Create a routed network . Select the edge gateway that you want your network to connect to and then click Next . <!-- add info about what the Create as subinterface checkbox is for --> In the Configure Network page, create a network Gateway address and Network mask , and add a DNS if possible. The Static IP pool is similar to DHCP in the sense that it's a range of IP addresses to be consumed by the VMs connecting to the network. When a VM is configured it will have a static manual or a static IP pool address assigned to it. For static manual, enter the address manually. This must be a valid address for the pool. The VM will keep this address for as long as it exists. For static IP pool, enter a range of addresses. A free address from the IP pool will be allocated to the machine automatically. As an example, if you give the gateway address as 192.168.1.1 , you may then want to give a static IP pool of 192.168.1.10 to 192.168.1.100 . This will give you a pool of 91 IP addresses to assign to machines within your network. You can always increase this later if needed. Click Next . Give the network a Name and Description . If you want to make the network shareable with other VDCs, select the Share this network check box. Click Next to review your settings, and then click Finish . Creating a routed VDC network (vCloud Director 9.1) To create a routed VDC network: In the vCloud Director Virtual Datacenters dashboard, select the VDC in which you want to create the network. In the left navigation panel, select Network . Click the Add button. In the Add Org VDC Network dialog box, from the Type radio buttons, select Routed network connecting to an existing edge gateway . Confirm that you're creating the network in the correct Org VDC . Enter a Name and Description for the network. If you want to make the network shareable with other VDCs, select the Share this network with other VDCs in this organization check box. Select the Edge Gateway that you want your network to connect to. Create a network Gateway address and Network mask , and add a DNS if possible. The Static IP Pool is similar to DHCP in the sense that it's a range of IP addresses to be consumed by the VMs connecting to the network. When a VM is configured it will have a static manual or a static IP pool address assigned to it. For static manual, enter the address manually. This must be a valid address for the pool.

This will give you a pool of 91 IP addresses to assign to machines within your network. You can always increase this later if needed. Click Add to create the static pool. When you're done, click Save . Next steps Now you've created your network to connect your VDC with the outside world, may want to configure your edge gateway to control what traffic is allowed into and out of your VDC.

    "keywords": "How to access Ubuntu update servers Overview When you create a virtual machine (VM) with an Ubuntu licence on it, you need to register the VM in order to receive updates for it. This guide explains how to access the Ubuntu repository servers to receive updates. Depending on whether your VM is on UKCloud's Assured OFFICIAL or Elevated OFFICIAL platform, there's a different process to follow. Before you attempt to establish connections to an Ubuntu repository server, you need to make sure your VMs can communicate with the Ubuntu server which exists outside of your cloud organisation. This may involve editing the NAT and firewall settings within your edge gateway to allow traffic to traverse into your virtual data centre (VDC). For how to do this, see the How to create NAT rules and How to create firewall rules . Assured OFFICIAL platform UKCloud's Assured OFFICIAL platform is internet facing, so you can simply configure your VM to connect to the internet, and use standard update tools such as apt-get to talk directly to the publicly available Ubuntu repositories. Elevated OFFICIAL platform UKCloud's Elevated OFFICIAL platform doesn't natively connect to the internet, and the PSN Protected network doesn't have any Ubuntu repository servers. To connect to an Ubuntu repository server for updates, you can use UKCloud-managed repository servers or a UKCloud Walled Garden. UKCloud-managed repository servers We provide Ubuntu repositories for the 12.04 and 14.04 LTS versions of Ubuntu on our Elevated OFFICIAL platform, so that customers with Ubuntu VMs can get software updates. To do this, issue the appropriate command for your release of Ubuntu to download a repository list file to your apt sources directory. For 12.04: sudo wget -P /etc/apt/sources.list.d http://x.y.89.96/repos/ukcloud_precise.list For 14.04: sudo wget -P /etc/apt/sources.list.d http://x.y.89.96/repos/ukcloud_trusty.list We also recommend that you rename the default /etc/apt/sources.list file to reduce the likelihood of errors during the update process that stem from attempts to access the internet-based Canonical Partner repositories. To do this, use the following command: sudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.old Replace x.y with the first two octets of the Elevated OFFICIAL public IP addresses. If you're not sure what these are, contact UKCloud Support. Walled Garden Choose this option only if you want full control of Ubuntu updates and are already thinking of deploying a UKCloud Walled Garden. This option involves pulling updates into the Assured platform, and using UKCloud's Walled Garden to move them to the Elevated platform. It's a much more complex solution than using UKCloud-managed repository servers, and you have sole responsibility for deploying and managing it. For more information about the Walled Garden, see the Getting Started Guide for Cross Domain Security Zone .

    "title": "How to access syslog data for your edge gateway | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to access syslog data for your edge gateway Overview Your edge gateway is globally configured to send syslog messages to a specific IP address ( 100.127.255.250 ). By configuring a new network or IP address within your virtual data centre (VDC) and deploying a collector with the syslog IP address, you can access your edge gateway syslog data. You can then use this data to check: Allowed and denied network traffic Load balancer statistics Load balancer health This guide explains the network configuration required to provision a syslog collector within your VDC to receive syslog information direct from your edge gateway. Collecting syslog data for a single edge gateway The simplest scenario is to gather syslog data from a single edge gateway into one collector. To do this you need to create a routable location for the syslog IP address, by either: Adding the syslog IP address to an existing network interface card (NIC) on a routed subnet Add the syslog IP address to a subnet on the routed network. For example, if your existing monitoring server has a NIC on eth0 (for example, 10.0.1.10 ), on routed Org VDC network 10.0.1.0/24 , you'd add the syslog IP address to eth0 . Add a route on the vCNS Edge that routes the syslog IP address via the subnet. For example, route 100.127.255.250 MASK 255.255.255.255 via 10.0.1.10 . Configure the software on your existing monitoring server to capture data from the IP address of the vCNS edge. Note The steps to achieve this depend on your operating system and chosen syslog server. Configuring a new routed network Create a new routed network with the following details: Org Network Name: Customer defined Gateway: 100.127.255.249 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.248 DNS: Customer defined Static IP Pool: 100.127.255.250 -- 100.127.255.254 You can find more detailed steps for creating a routed network in How to create a routed VDC network . Deploy a new syslog server connected to the new routed network with a static address of 100.127.255.250 and install and configure the syslog server's edge gateway. Note The steps to achieve this depend on your operating system and chosen syslog server. Collecting syslog data for multiple edge gateways If you have multiple edge gateways under a single NFT you can gather the data from all those edges into the same syslog collector. Set up a single syslog collector for one of your vCNS Edges as described in the previous section. Note We'll refer to this edge gateway as the syslog edge and all the other edge gateways as source edges . Confirm that you can see the local syslog traffic from the local syslog edge. Create a firewall rule on the syslog edge to allow syslog traffic from the source edges' TRANSIT IPs ( 172.26. x . x in Assured or 172.26. LOWER OCTET . x in Elevated) through to the syslog server IP. You can create individual rules using the following suggestions: <SOURCE TRANSIT IP>:Any to 100.127.255.250 on UDP Any:Any to 100.127.255.250:514 on UDP <NFT TRANSIT CIDR/SUBNET>:Any to 100.127.255.250:514 on UDP On each of the source edges, create a static route to direct traffic to the syslog edge. Use the following settings: Applied On: <nft_network> Name: Syslog traffic (or any other name you prefer) Network: 100.127.255.248/29 Next Hop IP: The TRANSIT IP address of the syslog edge Syslog packets from each source edge will now be forwarded to the syslog edge, with the source of the syslog traffic being the TRANSIT IP of the source edge. Perform a packet capture on the syslog collector to confirm it's receiving packets from the source edges. Note You may have to enable or disable logging on firewall rules to trigger syslog traffic. When you've confirmed that your syslog collector is receiving the syslog data, configure your syslog server to capture packets from the new syslog source. Enabling logging After setting up your syslog collector, you need to make sure that your edge gateway sends network traffic to the log. Edit your vCNS Edge firewall settings to log firewall rules: You must log each rule individually by selecting the Log network traffic for firewall rule option: To log data for actions not covered by individual rules, select the Log option next to the Default action setting: You can find more detailed steps for editing firewall settings in How to create firewall rules . Edit your load balancer settings to log virtual servers: You can find more detailed steps for editing load balancer settings in How to configure a load balancer .

    "keywords": "How to manage how your instance recovers from a host failure Overview UKCloud monitors UKCloud for OpenStack at regular intervals, checking for issues with the hardware or services supporting OpenStack. When a host experiences problems, our engineers will take steps to live migrate any instances on the affected host to an alternative one, however there may be cases where a host needs to be rebooted prior to any live migrations being successfully actioned. This guide outlines UKCloud's policy for handling OpenStack instances in the event of a service interruption to the availability of a host. The guide also describes how you can control the running state instances return when a host has been recovered. How does instance recovery work? If a host restarts, or if we have to reboot a host before live migrating your instances, any instances running on that host will be shut off. When we recover a host, there are two options for the recovery state of any instances that may have been affected: Manual restart of instance (default) - you must restart any affected instances when the host has been recovered Automatic restart of an instance - UKCloud will automatically restart any shut off instances on a recovered host You can set the recovery option for each of your instances in the instance metadata. Using the OpenStackClient command-line interface You can use the OpenStackClient command-line interface (CLI) to view and set the instance recovery option as follows: Checking the recovery option for an instance (CLI) To use the OpenStackClient CLI to check the recovery option for an instance: Run the following command from the OpenStackClient CLI: openstack server show <instance_ID_or_name> If the properties field in the results includes RestartOnFail='True' (as shown below), then your instance is set to automatically restart when the host has been recovered. If the properties field does not include RestartOnFail , then your instance will remain in a shut off state when the host has been recovered and you'll have to manually restart it. Setting the recovery option for an instance (CLI) To use the OpenStackClient CLI to set the recovery option for an instance: To set the recovery option so that the instance is automatically restarted when the host has been recovered, run the following command: openstack server set -- property RestartOnFail=True <instance_ID_or_name> To set the recovery option so that you must manually restart the instance when the host has been recovered, run the following command: openstack server unset -- property RestartOnFail <instance_ID_or_name> Using the OpenStack Horizon dashboard If you prefer, you can use the OpenStack Horizon dashboard to view and set the recovery option for an instance. Checking the recovery option for an instance (Horizon) To use the Horizon dashboard to check the recovery option for an instance: In the left side of the Horizon dashboard, expand the Compute menu and click Instances . On the Instances page, from the Actions list for your instance, select Update Metadata . In the Update Instance Metadata dialog box, if the Existing Metadata section includes the RestartOnFail='True' (as shown below), then your instance is set to automatically restart when the host has been recovered. If the Existing Metadata section does not include the RestartOnFail tag, then your instance will remain in a shut off state when the host has been recovered and you'll have to manually restart it. Setting the recovery option for an instance (Horizon) To use the Horizon dashboard to set the recovery option for an instance: In the left side of the Horizon dashboard, expand the Compute menu and click Instances . On the Instances page, from the Actions list for your instance, select Update Metadata . In the Update Instance Metadata dialog box: To set the recovery option so that the instance is automatically restarted when the host has been recovered, in the Custom field, enter RestartOnFail and click the + button. Then, in the RestartOnFail field, enter True . To set the recovery option so that you must manually restart the instance when the host has been recovered, next to the RestartOnFail field, click the – button. Click Save . Exclusions to UKCloud-managed instance recovery Although we've designed UKCloud for OpenStack to provide a level of hardware resilience, UKCloud, like most true cloud vendors, cannot guarantee total automated recovery of virtual resources in the event of infrastructure failures. As a result, you must ensure that the applications you deploy on OpenStack have been engineered to tolerate any infrastructure issues or failures through utilising multiple instances deployed across different zones to help ensure the overall availability of your solution.

    "keywords": "How to expose non-http services externally Overview UKCloud for OpenShift enables you to develop, deploy, and manage digital and container-based applications seamlessly across local physical or virtual environments, with full portability to and from UKCloud. This article explains how you can expose services outside of your OpenShift cluster without using routes. Intended audience This article assumes familiarity with services and routes in OpenShift and access to an account with cluster-admin permissions. Prerequisites To complete the steps in this guide, your cluster must have been deployed from a version of our code that enables our non-http functionality. You can raise a support ticket to: Check if your cluster already provides non-http functionality Request a new cluster to be deployed incorporating our non-http functionality. Getting the external IP You'll need to raise a support ticket with us that provides the network you'd like to expose services on and the ports/protocols of the services you'll be exposing. We'll update your environment to create the virtual infrastructure needed and provide you with the publicly accessible IP and the local IP this maps to. The local IP will be important for the upcoming steps. Note You can request multiple ports/protocols and networks for external services. Exposing your service Now you need to create the service you would like to expose. Create the service as usual, then patch the local IP we gave you into the service as its external IP using the following command (the example uses a local IP of 10.2.1.120): oc patch svc <service_name> -p '{\"spec\":{\"externalIPs\":[\"10.2.1.120\"]}}' Deploying ipfailover OpenShift has a feature called ipfailover that you can use to make an external IP accessible on a subset of nodes in the cluster. Use ipfailover to make your service available on the external IP. Enter the following commands to deploy ipfailover (you must have cluster-admin permissions): oc create sa ipfailover oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z ipfailover oc adm ipfailover --virtual-ips=10.2.1.120 --watch-port=0 --replicas=<amount_of_compute_nodes> --selector=\"node-role.kubernetes.io/compute=true\" --vrrp-id-offset=0 --create You'll need to pass the IP you've patched into the service as an external IP, using the --virtual-ips argument. You can use any node-selector you like for the --selector argument but make sure it's a valid node label. You must set --watch-port to 0 for the ipfailover deployment to work. The --replicas argument should equal the amount of nodes matching your --selector label. You will need to increment --vrrp-id-offset by one for each ipfailover deployment in your cluster, for example to expose another external IP your command might look like the following: oc adm ipfailover --virtual-ips=10.2.1.121 --watch-port=0 --replicas=<amount_of_compute_nodes> --selector=\"node-role.kubernetes.io/compute=true\" --vrrp-id-offset=1 --create Note You can only deploy one instance of ipfailover per project. Also, the deployment may sometimes go into a pending state. If this happens ensure that you've incremented --vrrp-id-offset (if necessary) and have given the ipfailover service account the required permissions inside the project you are deploying in: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z ipfailover You can now access your service on the public IP tied to the external IP. Tip You can access multiple services on the same external IP, they just need to be running on a different port.

    "keywords": "How to expand OpenShift persistent volumes Overview In OpenShift clusters running OpenShift v3.11 or later, you can expand existing persistent volumes. In earlier versions (such as v3.9) you need to raise a Service Request so that UKCloud OpenShift administrators can facilitate the expansion. Tip To check the version of your cluster, either click (?) in the top-right of the web UI and select About or run the following while connected in the CLI client: $ oc version ... Server https://console.5678-89abcd:8443 openshift v3.11.51 kubernetes v1.11.0+d4cacc0 Note You must scale down any pod or container using the volume before you can perform the expansion. Intended audience To complete the steps in this article, you must have access to a cluster that is running OpenShift Container Platform v3.11 (or newer). You must also have access to oc , the OpenShift command-line client (CLI). For more information, see OpenShift's Get Started with the CLI . Prerequisites If the cluster is v3.11 or newer, the storage class should be enabled for Volume Expansion.

The pod using the persistent volume in this example is named logging-es-data-master and the pvc (Persistent Volume Claim) name is logging-es-0 . This is a common scenario - a high throughput of logs may cause Elasticsearch to enter a CrashLoop when the logging volume fills up. You can apply the same procedure to any other pods that use persistent volumes. $ oc project openshift-logging Now using project \"openshift-logging\" on server \"https://console.5678-89abcd:8443\". $ oc get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE logging-es-data-master-7bqadxxd-1-wrlqh 2/2 Running 2 2d ... logging-kibana-1-n7j8t 2/2 Running 2 2d $ oc get dc NAME REVISION DESIRED CURRENT TRIGGERED BY logging-es-data-master-7bqadxxd 1 1 1 logging-kibana 1 1 1 config In this example, the logging-kibana pod depends on the logging-es-data-master pod so it's good practice to also scale this down during the expansion of the persistent volume for logging-es-data-master : $ for i in $(oc get dc | awk 'NR>1 {print $1}') ; do oc scale --replicas=0 dc $i; done deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/logging-kibana scaled deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/logging-es-data-master-7bqadxxd scaled # For a single deployment, generally: oc scale --replicas=0 dc <deployment_name> Confirm that the pod that uses the volume has been terminated: $ oc get pods | grep logging-es-data-master # (nothing returned) Resize the persistent volume Once the pod dependent on the volume is stopped, you can edit the pvc to resize the volume: $ oc get pvc NAME STATUS VOLUME CAPACITY ACCESS MODES STORAGECLASS AGE logging-es-0 Bound pvc-4ad7258e-12a6-11e9-bc9d-fa163e12bba5 20Gi RWO tier2 2d $ oc edit pvc logging-es-0 ... oc edit causes the configuration of the object to open in a text editor.

    "keywords": "How to permit outbound access to internet hosts in deployments with government community network connectivity Overview This article outlines the necessary steps to whitelist domain names within the Squid proxy. Squid is an enabled service within v3.11 OpenShift clusters deployed with connectivity to government community networks (such as: HSCN, PSN, Janet). Whitelisted domains can be accessed on the internet via the proxy, enabling you to request external resources/data on nodes that previously only had connectivity to government community networks. Added domains should be scrutinised as the relevant authority of the community network may require you to submit documentation regarding these for you to receive accreditation. Prerequisites To complete the steps in this guide, you must have access to a cluster that is running OpenShift Container Platform v3.11 (or newer) with connectivity to a government community network. Squid proxy is not currently enabled within environments that do not have access to a government community network. You must also have access to either: the OpenShift Web console oc , the OpenShift command-line client (CLI). For more information, see OpenShift's Get Started with the CLI Destination domain whitelist Squid proxy is installed as a service on the control plane load balancers. Within the Squid configuration, we have specified an ACL (Access Control List) as being a list of destination domains (present in a file on the file system), which we will refer to as the whitelist for the remainder of this article. Outbound traffic from the cluster's internal network will pass through the proxy with the destination domain being compared against the whitelist for each connection attempt; if the domain exists then outbound internet traffic is permitted, otherwise it is denied with a HTTP 403 error. By default, the following domains are added to the whitelist (and cannot be removed) to facilitate installation, testing and ongoing operation of the cluster: registry.access.redhat.com registry.redhat.io <UKCloud Object Storage Endpoint - cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com OR cas.frn00006.ukcloud.com> <UKCloud SSO Endpoint - idp.ukcloud.com> Warning Adding any subdomains of domains that are already within the proxy whitelist will lead to squid being unable to reconfigure and any domains added after this point will not be whitelisted. Please keep the above domains in mind when adding to the whitelist as these will not be shown in the ConfigMap. To give an example, you should avoid adding .ukcloud.com or .redhat.com to your proxy-whitelist as both registry.access.redhat.com and idp.ukcloud.com are already whitelisted by us. A scheduled job (which runs at 0 minutes past every hour) on the OpenShift cluster Bastion host reads a Config Map named proxy-whitelist within the whitelist project. If there are any modifications to this Config Map, the job overwrites the previous custom entries within the whitelist and triggers a reconfigure task on the Squid proxy to enable the updated domains to be accessed. Assigning non cluster-admin users rights to edit the whitelist By default, only users who have been assigned the cluster-admin role will be able to view/edit the proxy-whitelist ConfigMap object within the whitelist project. It is possible to grant non cluster-admin users rights to edit this object but this should be given careful consideration. The ability to access hosts on the internet, from nodes that previously only had access to government community networks, exposes the cluster to additional risk (should a domain be whitelisted that hosts malicious content for example). For this reason, only trusted users should be permitted to determine these domains to reduce the risk of a malicious domain being unwittingly added. To allow non cluster-admin users to edit this object, use the following Role Based Access Control (RBAC) commands: Tip To add multiple users to these roles, separate each username within the username variable with a space. export username=<replace-with-username> # Create roles oc create role view-project --verb=get,list,watch --resource=namespaces --verb get --resource=projects -n whitelist oc create role get-configmap --verb=get,list --resource=configmaps -n whitelist oc create role edit-proxy-whitelist --verb=patch,update --resource=configmaps --resource-name=proxy-whitelist -n whitelist # Bind roles to desired user oc policy add-role-to-user view-project $username -n whitelist --role-namespace='whitelist' oc policy add-role-to-user get-configmap $username -n whitelist --role-namespace='whitelist' oc policy add-role-to-user edit-proxy-whitelist $username -n whitelist --role-namespace='whitelist' Modifying the whitelist There are two tools you can use to modify the proxy-whitelist Config Map. As previously stated you will need to have the necessary rights to edit this object within the whitelist project. Web console To view the proxy-whitelist Config Map within the whitelist project, navigate to the following URL (ensuring you replace <your-deployment-name>): https://ocp.<your-deployment-name>.cna.ukcloud.com:8443/console/project/whitelist/browse/config-maps/proxy-whitelist Tip To whitelist all subdomains, precede the domain with a . for example .domain.com Click Actions then Edit to modify the values within the proxy-whitelist.txt key. Each domain should be on its own line: Click Save when finished. oc client Note To authenticate using the oc client you will need an API token. Retrieve this by logging in to the Web Console and clicking your name in the top right then choosing Copy Login Command . This can then be pasted from your buffer into a terminal where you have the oc client installed. Change to the whitelist project: $ oc project whitelist Edit the proxy-whitelist Config Map: $ oc edit cm proxy-whitelist This will display the object definition in yaml format in your default text editor: # Please edit the object below. Lines beginning with a '#' will be ignored, # and an empty file will abort the edit. If an error occurs while saving this file will be # reopened with the relevant failures. # apiVersion: v1 data: proxy-whitelist.txt: \"\" kind: ConfigMap metadata: creationTimestamp: 2019-01-18T01:18:44Z name: proxy-whitelist namespace: whitelist resourceVersion: \"5385199\" selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/whitelist/configmaps/proxy-whitelist uid: ff7df4a9-1abe-11e9-965a-fa163ecc60e0 Within the object definition data attribute is the proxy-whitelist.txt key. By default this will be an empty single line string but you can modify this to be a multi-line string by changing \"\" to |- as below and indenting the domains you want to add with two spaces. For example: proxy-whitelist.txt: |- firstdomain.com .seconddomain.com Save your changes to persist to the Config Map, otherwise cancel your edit to not make any changes.

UKCloud provides a fully provisioned, single-tenant OpenShift instance to each customer, enabling developers to totally focus on delivering business value, without having to worry about any infrastructure considerations. This Getting Started Guide provides an overview of the functionality available with UKCloud for OpenShift and includes links to OpenShift documentation for further detail. Intended audience This guide is intended for developers who want to leverage the benefits of Docker and Kubernetes containerisation technologies as part of their development, continuous integration or continuous delivery cycles. Introduction to UKCloud for OpenShift IT projects are traditionally complex, requiring careful management of server hardware, storage, networking, operating systems, middleware, as well as development of the actual application. UKCloud for OpenShift removes complexity and enables you to focus on creating business value through development, testing and scaling of your applications. UKCloud deploys, scales and monitors the platform, which frees up your DevOps resource to focus on adding value further up the stack - for example, in automated software testing or tuning autoscaling. You can use UKCloud for OpenShift to: Host front-end web applications services to ensure that your environment: Can scale to handle any demands placed on it Will auto-heal in the event of problems to maintain high levels of availability Create an Internet of Things (IoT) endpoint enabling internet devices to talk to your cloud applications, with all the benefits described above Provide an elastic analytics platform for capturing and analysing machine data and social media feeds, to generate valuable intelligence such as sentiment analysis Support modern microservice architecture and bring manageability and scalability to your applications UKCloud-deployed Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform OpenShift Container Platform is an open source PaaS, developed and supported by Red Hat and based around common technologies such as Docker containers and the Kubernetes container cluster manager for enterprise application development. UKCloud for OpenShift provides a full Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform that has been deployed by UKCloud and is ready to consume without delay. We deploy an OpenShift project in which you can run multiple pods, with each pod containing a group of related Docker containers. OpenShift documentation: Architecture and Container Security Guide Before you begin To complete the steps in this guide, you must have access to an OpenShift environment, along with an internet-enabled device capable of running an HTML5 capable browser. As part of your onboarding, UKCloud will provide you with a URL and credentials to access your OpenShift environment. In addition, we recommend the installation of the OpenShift CLI on your device. OpenShift documentation: Get Started with the CLI Initial environment UKCloud will provision you with an OpenShift Foundation Pack, providing you with 32GiB of container resources to deploy your applications. You can expand your cluster by requesting Runtime Packs. Runtime Packs come in three sizes: small (16GiB 2vCPU), medium (32GiB 4vCPU) and large (64GiB 8vCPU) and are deployed by UKCloud via a Service Request through the UKCloud Portal. Using the web console The OpenShift Container Platform web console is a user interface accessible from a web browser. Developers can use the web console to visualize, browse, and manage the contents of projects. If your OpenShift cluster uses OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 3.10 or later, you can log in to the console, via our single sign on service, using your UKCloud Portal credentials. Additionally, if you've set up two-factor authentication (2FA) in the Portal, when logging in using your Portal credentials, you'll be prompted for a 2FA code. Note To log in to the OpenShift web console using your Portal credentials, your Portal account must have been granted access to the cluster. If your OpenShift cluster uses an earlier version of OCP, you will need to use your separate OpenShift credentials to log in to the console. OpenShift documentation: Web Console Walkthrough Using the command-line interface With the OpenShift Container Platform command line interface (CLI), you can create applications and manage OpenShift Container Platform projects from a terminal. If your OpenShift cluster uses OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 3.10 or later, when you enter the login command, you'll be given a URL to use to log in using your Portal credentials. Go to this URL and you'll be prompted for your Portal credentials and, if you've set up 2FA, your 2FA code. This will take you to a page with your API token, the command to run to log in to the CLI and curl request to use to log in to the CLI. Alternatively, you can obtain the CLI login command (including login token) from the OpenShift console by clicking your user name and selecting Copy Login Command . Note The token in the log in command supplied through the URL or OpenShift console is valid only for a limited time. If you require a more longer lasting token, you can use a service account token. For more information see the OpenShift Service Accounts documentation. OpenShift documentation: Basic Walkthrough Using the CLI and CLI Reference Using the API The OpenShift Container Platform distribution of Kubernetes includes the Kubernetes v1 REST API and the OpenShift v1 REST API. These are RESTful APIs accessible via HTTP(s) on the OpenShift Container Platform master servers. These REST APIs can be used to manage end-user applications, the cluster, and the users of the cluster. OpenShift documentation: REST API Reference Developing and deploying applications OpenShift Container Platform is designed for building and deploying applications. You can begin your application's development from scratch using OpenShift Container Platform directly or develop locally then use OpenShift Container Platform to deploy your fully developed application. OpenShift documentation: Developer Guide Creating and using images Containers in OpenShift Container Platform are based on Docker-formatted container images. An image is a binary that includes all the requirements for running a single container, as well as metadata describing its needs and capabilities. Containers only have access to resources defined in the image unless you give the container additional access when creating it. OpenShift documentation: Creating images and Using images Next steps In this Getting Started Guide, you've learned the basics about UKCloud for OpenShift. For more information, see the OpenShift documentation at OpenShift Container Platform 3.9 Documentation Glossary This section provides a glossary of terms specific to UKCloud for OpenShift. cluster One or more masters and a set of nodes. container A lightweight mechanism for isolating running processes so that they are limited to interacting with only their designated resources.

    "keywords": "Storage policies Overview Each Virtual Machine (VM) is bound to a storage policy whereby the storage policy guarantees a certain level of capacity, performance, availability, redundancy, and so on from a storage perspective. Note A storage policy does not contain a VMs data; it merely defines the storage service level. When you create virtual machines (VMs) within vCloud Director, as part of the process you will be prompted to choose a storage policy to assign to that particular virtual machine. This will be presented as a drop-down list where you will have a few options depending on the service level of your VDC. An example of this is below, showing the storage policies available on the Basic service level. The ability to choose storage policies is useful in certain scenarios where VMs are required to be on different underlying storage. An example of this would be a replicated database server with separation of replicas onto different storage profiles. Storage policies description Storage policies enable you to choose where the VM sits on the underlying infrastructure, giving you flexibility in terms of VM placement. The storage profiles are all at the same storage tier (for example, Basic) and all make use of the array in the same way (that is, the same mix of flash, SAS and NL-SAS). We provide three storage profiles to provide you with the option of influencing where the VM/data is located. STANDARD-Any is the default and allows for the VM to be placed as UKCloud determine. STANDARD-Storage1 and STANDARD-Storage2 are the profiles that allow the storage placement to be decided by you. VMs associated with Storage1 are located on different data stores and disks compared to VMs associated with Storage2 . Limitations Customers with Optimised Storage enabled (service request via the UKCloud Portal) will be able to select their Optimised Storage policy within the drop-down box shown above. Beyond this, UKCloud only offer Storage1 and Storage2 storage policies, and don't scale this out further. Storage policies are only available for production environments; trial and test/dev environments do not have user-configurable storage policies.

    "keywords": "UKCloud for VMware options Introduction Each enterprise application has its own set of technical and service requirements that must be addressed on an individual basis. UKCloud for VMware is completely configurable, and gives you the flexibility to use different service levels, virtual machine (VM) sizes, security domains, connectivity and data protection options. ^ All workloads include 60GB of Tier 2 storage for free, all storage is persistent and resilient to local hardware failures. Workloads can use multiple storage profiles ^^ All customers can use catalogue and template-based recovery Security domain The UKCloud provides two security domains: Assured OFFICIAL provides access to public networks, such as the internet, PSN, HCSN and Janet Elevated OFFICIAL provides access to restricted networks such as PSN Choose the security domain your workload needs to use. Workload (VM) type Some workloads require the highest levels of resilience and performance, some are sensitive to changing conditions, whereas others merely require a reliable infrastructure. Tailor the compute characteristics of the VM to support the requirements of your workload. Choose the workload type that best suits your application: ESSENTIAL - For lower priority workloads, such as temporary applications, data processing or system modelling tasks. VMs in the VDC can have contended compute resource allocation (CPU/RAM) and automated rebalancing is enabled to ensure the workload receives the requested performance. POWER - For key workloads that are resource intensive, such as web and application workloads, mid-sized databases and caching services. VMs in the VDC have an uncontended compute resource allocation and automated rebalancing is enabled to pre-emptively optimise performance and availability. PRIORITY - For critical workloads that handle important business processes that benefit from a steady state of operation. VMs in the VDC have an uncontended compute resource allocation and automated rebalancing is configured to reduce workload movement around the platform. Storage options You can choose from a variety of options, depending on whether your workload requires high performance or longer-term retention storage. You can even deploy mixed environments to deliver exactly what you need. Choose any additional storage needed to support your application and add as many storage options as you need for the different aspects of your application. For example, you could use Tier 1 storage for the high I/O database application and Tier 2 to store seldom-accessed media. Tier 1 storage provides fast block storage, optimised for data warehouses, busy transactional databases and other high IO workloads. Tier 2 storage provides general all-purpose block storage, providing a balance of performance and cost. Data protection options Whether you're driven by recovery point (RPO) or recovery time (RTO), you can choose the right level of automated, on-platform protection for your environments. The UKCloud for VMware service offers three different protection options for your VMs. Catalogue and template-based recovery is a configuration management solution that can reprovision stateless servers to a new VM when required, using standard and catalogue-based VM templates. Snapshot Protection provides a daily backup of your VMs. You can select a retention period of either 14 or 28 days. Journaling Protection uses journals to store all write operations made to your VMs on a separate UKCloud site. Choose the application and data protection needed for your solution. You can choose only one protection option to cover both VMs and storage. For example, if you choose Journaling Protection for your VMs, you cannot then choose 14-day Snapshot Protection for your storage; Journaling Protection will apply to both.

    "keywords": "How to migrate vApps between virtual data centres Overview If you have multiple virtual data centres (VDCs), you may find that you want to migrate vApps from VDC to VDC; whether that be from a test and dev environment into production or between VDCs with different service levels. There are two ways to migrate vApps between VDCs: copy and move. This article describes how to use these different methods to migrate your VDCs. Copying a VDC You may want to copy your vApp from one VDC to another VDC, leaving the original vApp in the source VDC that you can continue to use. You can perform the vApp copy operation on running vApps. Note As this is a copy operation, this will create additional VMs which will be charged at the standard UKCloud rate. To copy a vApp: Using vCloud Director 8.20 Using vCloud Director 9.1 In vCloud Director, select the My Cloud tab. Right-click the vApp you want to copy and select Copy to . In the Copy dialog box, you can rename the vApp and select which VDC you want to migrate it to. You can also change the storage policy for each virtual machines (VMs) within the vApp. When you're happy with the configuration, click OK to begin the copy operation. Note The copy operation may take some time and the performance of any running VMs within the source vApp may be impacted due to the copy process. In the vCloud Director Virtual Datacenters dashboard, select the VDC that contains the vApp you want to copy. In the left navigation panel, click vApps . In the card for the vApp that you want to copy, click More then select Copy to . In the Copy dialog box, enter a Name for the copied vApp and select which VDC you want to migrate it to. You can also change the storage policy for each virtual machines (VMs) within the vApp. When you're happy with the configuration, click OK to begin the copy operation. Note The copy operation may take some time and the performance of any running VMs within the source vApp may be impacted due to the copy process. Moving a VDC You may want to completely move your vApp from one VDC to another VDC. This will remove the vApp from the source VDC and move it to the destination. To perform this operation, the vApp must be powered off. To move a vApp: Using vCloud Director 8.20 Using vCloud Director 9.1 In vCloud Director, select the My Cloud tab. Find the vApp that you want to move and ensure that it is completely powered off by right-clicking the vApp and selecting Power Off . When the vApp is powered off, right-click it and select Move to . In the Move dialog box, you can select which VDC you want to migrate the vApp to. You can also change the storage policy for each VM witin the vApp. When you're happy with the configuration, click OK to begin the move operation. Note It may take some time to move the vApp from one VDC to another. When the move operation is complete, power the vApp back on by right-clicking it and selecting Start . In the vCloud Director Virtual Datacenters dashboard, select the VDC that contains the vApp you want to move. In the left navigation panel, click vApps . In the card for the vApp that you want to move, click More then select Move to . In the Move dialog box, select which VDC you want to migrate the vApp to. You can also change the storage policy for each VMs within the vApp. When you're happy with the configuration, click OK to begin the move operation.

    "title": "How to install and configure OpenVPN | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to install and configure OpenVPN Overview Secure remote access to the cloud is essential to cloud adoption and use. UKCloud for VMware comes with a dedicated edge gateway, providing a simple and easy-to-use solution that supports IPsec site-to-site virtual private networks (VPNs) and a limited number of remote access client VPNs designed for occasional use. If you require a more flexible or scalable solution, you can deploy your own choice of virtual appliances (either open-source solutions, such as OpenVPN or commercial solutions from a supplier, such as Cisco, F5 or Palo Alto), instead of using the limited VPN service provided with the default edge gateway. This article details the steps required to obtain, deploy and configure an OpenVPN virtual appliance to obtain remote access to your virtual data centres (VDCs) running on the UKCloud platform. Note OpenVPN is a licensed product. Without a licence key, you are limited to only two concurrent VPN connections. If you require additional concurrent connections, you'll need to obtain and install a licence key. Preparing your virtual data centre Create a new VDC network To secure your environment, we recommend that you deploy the OpenVPN appliance into a new, routed VDC network. Ideally, no other virtual machines (VMs) should connect to this network. This enables you to tightly control access from VPN clients to the VMs in your environment using firewall rules on the edge gateway. However, if you're approaching the network interface limit of your edge gateway, it's possible to deploy the OpenVPN appliance into an existing network. More information! How to create a routed VDC network Configuring the edge gateway After you've created the network, you'll need to configure the edge gateway to control access to the VMs in your environment by creating: A Source NAT rule to allow the OpenVPN appliance outbound access to the internet. A Destination NAT rule to allow inbound access from the internet. A firewall rule to allow inbound access from the internet on port 443 . One or more firewall rules to allow users connected to the OpenVPN appliance to access VMs on other networks for administration purposes. Note that all VPN users will be NATed to the IP address of the OpenVPN appliance. One or more firewall rules to allow access from trusted environments to the OpenVPN appliance on the admin port ( 943 by default, but can be changed). More information! How to create NAT rules and How to create firewall rules . Obtaining the latest OpenVPN appliance To ensure you're running the latest release of OpenVPN, we recommend that you download the latest version of the appliance directly from the OpenVPN website: Go to the following location to download the latest OVA file: https://swupdate.openvpn.org/appliances/AS2.ova In vCloud Director, select the Catalogs tab. In the left navigation panel, select My Organization's Catalogs . Open the catalog you'd like to add the appliance to, or create a new catalog. Click the Upload button and upload the OVA file to the catalog. Deploying the OpenVPN appliance The steps for deploying the OpenVPN appliance depend on the version of vCloud Director available in your environment: vCloud Director 8.20 vCloud Director 9.1 vCloud Director 8.20 To deploy the OpenVPN appliance: In vCloud Director, select the My Cloud tab. In the left navigation panel, select vApps . In the toolbar, click the Add vApp from OVF icon. In the Add vApp from OVF wizard, on the Select Source page, select Local file and browse to the OVA file that you downloaded, then click Next . The appliance will be deployed as a single VM inside the vApp. On the Review Details page, confirm the details of the OVA file and then click Next On the Select Name and Location page, enter a meaningful Name and Description for your vApp From the Virtual Datacenter list, select the VDC in which you want to create the vApp and then click Next . On the Configure Resources page, select your desired storage policy and then click Next . On the Configure Networking page, provide a name for the VM. Select the Switch to the advanced networking workflow check box. This enables you to select your desired network and change the IP assignment method. Typically, we recommend that you deploy the VPN appliance to its own network segment (as described in Preparing your virtual data centre , and use the Static IP Pool method of IP assignment. Continue through the wizard and click Finish . There are no further changes necessary unless you want to customise the vApp further to suit your environment. When the vApp has deployed and is powered on, you'll need to reset (reboot) the VM before logging in for the first time to force the networking changes made during VMWare's guest customisations to take effect before you start configuring OpenVPN. vCloud Director 9.1 To deploy the OpenVPN appliance: In the vCloud Director Virtual Datacenters dashboard, select the VDC in which you want to depoly the OpenVPN appliance. In the left navigation panel, select vApps . Click Add vApp from OVF . Select the OVA that you downloaded then click Next . Review the details of the OVA to confirm that it's the right images then click Next . The appliance will be deployed as a single VM inside a vApp. Provide a name for the vApp then click Next . Provide a valid NetBIOS host name and your desired storage policy then click Next . Configure the network by selecting Switch to advanced networking workflow . Select the network adapter type, network and IP pool assignment ( Manual ) then click Next . Select the number of vCPUs, sockets and memory this appliance will have then click Next . Review the details then click Finish to deploy the vApp and appliance. When the vApp has deployed and is powered on, you'll need to reset (reboot) the VM before logging in for the first time to force the networking changes made during VMWare's guest customisations to take effect before you start configuring OpenVPN. Performing initial configuration To perform initial configuration: In vCloud Director, open the console for your OpenVPN VM. Log in to the VM as the root user. Tip To obtain the root password: In vCloud Director 8.20, right-click the VM, select Properties , click the Guest OS Customization tab and make a note of the password. In vCloud Director 9.1, in the card for the VM, click Details then select Guest OS Customization and make a note of the password. You'll be prompted to answer a series of questions: Licence agreement: --- Enter yes to accept. Will this be the primary Access Server node? --- Enter yes . Please specify the network interface and IP address to be used by the Admin Web UI -- If the guest customisations were applied correctly, this should default to eth0 , which should be configured with an IP address on the network you selected during deployment. Please specify the port number for the Admin Web UI --- Enter your desired port number, or accept the default of 943 . A separate port is not strictly needed for administration but is recommended. Please specify the TCP port number for the OpenVPN Daemon --- We recommend that you use the default of 443 where possible as the use of a non-standard port may cause problems when connecting from corporate networks. Should client traffic be routed by default through VPN? --- Entering yes will prevent your client device from accessing any other networks (for example, your corporate network) while the VPN is connected. For ease of use, we suggest you answer no to this question. Should client DNS traffic be routed by default through the VPN? --- If you answered yes to the previous question, all traffic will be routed through the VPN anyway, so your answer here will not matter. If you answered no to the previous question, you'll probably want to answer no to this question so that your DNS queries are answered by the usual servers. Use local authentication via internal DB? --- Enter yes unless you want to authenticate users from an existing directory service (Active Directory/LDAP). Should private subnets be accessible to clients by default? --- Answer yes to enable access to your cloud networks via the VPN. Do you wish to login to the Admin UI as \"openvpn\"? --- Answer yes to create a local user account named openvpn . If you answer no , you'll need to set up a different user name and password. Please specify your OpenVPN-AS license key --- If you've purchased a licence, enter the licence key, otherwise leave this blank. When you've completed the setup wizard, you'll need to create user accounts and passwords on the local operating system (unless you configured an LDAP directory). If you opted to use the default openvpn account, you'll need to configure its password: #passwd openvpn Press ^D to log off the console, but before you do so, there are some additional system configurations, detailed in the following sections, that you might want to perform while you're connected to the console. Check the DNS resolver configuration is in place During our tests, the DNS resolver configuration was not added by the VMware customisations. Enter the following command: # pico /etc/network/interfaces Use the arrow keys to scroll down. Below the line specifying the default gateway, add the following: dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 Press ^O to save the file, then ^X to exit the text editor. Restart the networking service for the change to take effect: # service networking restart Configure the keyboard The default configuration is for a US keyboard. To reconfigure for UK: Enter the following command: # dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration Step through the wizard. There's no need to restart anything when you're finished. Apply updates It's a good idea to apply the latest upgrades to the system. Enter the following command: # apt-get update && apt-get upgrade You'll be prompted to approve the installation of any updates. Install NTP Installing NTP is good practice anyway, but is required if you intend to use two-factor authentication via Google Authenticator. Enter the following command: # apt-get install ntp When the installation is complete, update the configuration file to point to UKCloud's NTP servers. # pico /etc/ntp.config Use the arrow keys to scroll down until you reach the lines beginning with server . Change the first two lines to reflect the UKCloud servers, and comment out the remaining two lines. Contact UKCloud Support for the UKCloud server IP addresses. Configuring administration options To configure administration options: Log on to the admin interface at: https://<ip_address>/admin To set the hostname, under Configuration , select Server Network Settings and then set the Hostname or IP Address to either a public IP address or a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that your client will be able to resolve. Save the settings on this page. Under Configuration , select VPN settings and, in the Routing section, add any additional subnets that your VPN users should have access to. These will usually be the IP subnets configured on all of your VDC networks. This is the minimum configuration required to be able to establish a VPN connection. If you want to create new user accounts, under User Management , select User Permissions . You can configure the password for each account by clicking the Show link in the More Settings column. Note Be sure to use complex passwords. Logging in and connecting You can download the VPN client software and connection profiles directly from the appliance by browsing to the following location and logging in with a valid user name and password: https://<ip_address>/ The downloaded client software and profile includes the client certificate that is required for authentication. When you've installed the client software or profile, you can initiate connections directly from the client. Securing the appliance We strongly recommend that you further secure the appliance by making the changes suggested in the following sections. Change all default passwords If you've not already done so, change the root password to something more secure. Log in to the OpenVPN VM console as the root user. Enter the following command: # passwd Lock down unused ports with iptables The OpenVPN configuration utility adds the required ALLOW entries to iptables automatically. To deny all other traffic, enter the following command: # iptables -A INPUT -j DROP Enable two-factor authentication via Google Authenticator You can enable two-factor authentication via the OpenVPN administration interface. Log on to the administration interface with the default account at: https://<ip_address>/admin Under Configuration , select Client Settings then click the checkbox to enable Google Authenticator support. Note Users will need to enter or scan the Google Authenticator secret by logging into the client portal ( http://<ip_address>/ ). When they've configured the secret, they should click the I scanned the QR code button to enforce two-factor authentication. Lock down the Admin Web UI and Client Web UI By default, both Admin and Client UIs are accessible over port 443 . This can pose a security risk if you've opened port 443 to the internet to allow users to connect from anywhere. Besides the obvious risk of unauthorised access to the administration interface, should an attacker gain access to the client interface, they'll be able to download the client certificates necessary to establish a VPN connection. You can limit the administration and client interfaces so that they are accessible only via the administration port number ( 943 by default). This enables you to restrict access to this port to a trusted IP address or network, while allowing VPN access on port 443 from anywhere. Your users will need to log in initially from the trusted network to install the client software, client certificate and configure Google Authenticator, before being able to establish VPN access. To lock down the administration and client interfaces: Log on to the administration interface with the default account at: https://<ip_address>/admin Under Configuration , select Server Network Settings . Under Service Forwarding in the VPN Server section, clear the check boxes for Admin Web Server and Client Web Server . Disable root SSH login If connecting via SSH, it's best practice to connect with a non-privileged account, then sudo to root if needed. This prevents an attacker from brute-forcing the root password. Enter the following command: # pico /etc/ssh/sshd\\_config Use the arrow keys to scroll down the file, and change the PermitRootLogin to no . Disable the default account During the initial setup, you created an user name and password to log in to the administration interface. This account, with the name openvpn , is configured to be always active, disregarding its status in the User Permissions area. In addition, if you configured two-factor authentication via Google Authenticator, this is not enforced for the default account. To disable the default account: Enter the following command: # pico /usr/local/openvpn_as/etc/as.conf Use the arrow keys to scroll down the file until you see entries starting with boot_pam_users . Comment out the entry for the user name you chose for the default account. Usually this is the boot_pam_users.0= entry. Restart the OpenVPN service for the change to take effect: # service restart openvpnas More help If you have any issues regarding the updating or support of Microsoft Server, contact the UKCloud support team by raising a Service Request.

    "keywords": "Application-tuned DDoS protection Service Scope About this document This document is intended to provide additional information regarding the optional application-tuned DDoS protection service that is available for UKCloud services. This is an additional service to the standard DDoS protection that is provided for all Assured UKCloud services. It is recommended that all customers consult with a cloud architect when considering this option to ensure it is right for their solution, including options when applying the service. For additional information, please refer to the Application-tuned DDoS protection FAQs . Application-tuned DDoS protection Whilst the default UKCloud DDoS protection offers protection for the UKCloud community, it is not specific to any one customer. The Application-tuned DDoS protection from Neustar is a fully-managed DDoS protection solution backed by an industry-leading Security Operations Team that scrubs your website's malicious traffic - delivering only clean, legitimate traffic to your site. In addition, there are multiple deployment configurations available within the portal to meet your needs, and the solution is flexible depending on your specific requirements. The cloud-based service mitigates attacks in the cloud, far away from your infrastructure and with the bandwidth and flexibility to repel today's largest attacks. Using proven methodologies, Neustar's experienced DDoS fighters intelligently match technology to threats, surgically derailing even the most complex attacks. The Always-On Hybrid managed solution removes the burden of DDoS with an on-site Arbor appliance for smaller DDoS attacks combined with cloud-based failover for larger, sustained attacks. Remote management of monitoring, detecting and responding to DDoS attacks minimizes downtime and frees your valuable resources. UKCloud has partnered with Neustar for the provision of this service due to their global presence, experience, success in DDoS protection and traffic monitoring, established service and loyal customer base. In addition, we also offer a Global Load Balancing service with Neustar to offer a complete traffic monitoring and protection solution. Cloud-based scrubbing Activated through a simple DNS or BGP redirection of your internet traffic, this service absorbs & scrubs bad traffic, allowing clean traffic to flow to your infrastructure. It also dynamically distinguishes legitimate traffic from attack traffic (either from malicious or naïve sources) by utilizing dedicated DDoS mitigation equipment from multiple vendors. This multi-vendor approach allows us to surgically leverage the unique DDoS mitigation capabilities of each vendor's solution. We supplement this equipment with proprietary DDoS mitigation capabilities to create a superset of DDoS fighting tools that can support focused scrubbing algorithms. We also leverage the years of DDoS mitigation experience of the Neustar 24x7 Security Operations Team to manually fine-tune these resources. This service can be used to defend most standard TCP-based applications including: websites, email servers, APIs, databases and more. Unlike many others, our solution protects your entire internet ecosystem. The service is completely on-demand, so you decide when and if you want to activate mitigation by adjusting the settings and details with the customer portal that is made available to you on provision of the service.

    "title": "Telecommunications Service Provider engagement | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Telecommunications Service Provider engagement Overview The purpose of this document is to outline the engagement process, demarcation points and the responsibilities of all parties involved in the provisioning of connectivity into UKCloud's datacentres using the HybridConnect and CrownConnect services provided by UKCloud. This document should be attached to any order made with telco providers to ensure that all parties are of the same understanding with regards to implementation. HybridConnect and CrownConnect enable customers to bring in their own MPLS, leased lines or public network connectivity into the UKCloud datacentres. These can be paired with Cloud Enablement - the colocation of network attached devices (firewalls, VPN concentrators, and so on) to enable the overlay of encryption technologies on the connectivity. High level process To facilitate a HybridConnect or CrownConnect order, UKCloud expects that: The end customer or partner will order the connection directly with the service provider that they wish to contract with. At the same time, the customer or partner will raise a Service Request through the UKCloud Portal to make UKCloud support aware of the need for HybridConnect or CrownConnect. UKCloud will provide information where needed to help the customer or partner complete forms that the telco provider requires in order to progress the order. The telco provider will liaise with Ark to gain site access to perform a site survey and then a subsequent visit to install any kit required into their racks within the MMR. Ark will provide connectivity between the telco termination point and the UKCloud patch panel. UKCloud will liaise with the partner or customer to arrange for onward connectivity from the UKCloud patch panel to the UKCloud environment. This may require additional information gathering. In the case where Cloud Enablement is required, this will involve additional engineer work from both customer/partner and UKCloud. UKCloud will complete the logical and physical connectivity to enable a live service. Telcos with a presence in Ark Telco providers will need to have a presence in the Ark Meet Me Room (MMR) in order to provide a service to the customer or partner. The location where a telco has presence defines whether HybridConnect or CrownConnect can be used. If the telco has presence in a core UKCloud location (A9 or SQ17), then HybridConnect can be used. If the telco has presence in Ark but outside of UKCloud's core locations, then CrownConnect must be used. The following telcos have a presence in Ark MMRs: BT * Vodafone * CenturyLink * Virgin Media * Interoute * GTT * Redcentric SSE * - has known presence in core UKCloud locations If a service provider does not have a presence in Ark, then they will need to contact Ark Continuity directly in order to gain presence. It is not the responsibility of the customer/partner or UKCloud to contact Ark on behalf of the telco. Completing telco order form When completing the telco order form, it is important to state the correct address of the Ark datacentre that the connectivity will be provisioned in. The addresses of UKCloud's core locations are: Farnborough Building A9, Cody Technology Park, Farnborough, Hampshire, GU14 0LX Corsham Building SQ17, Spring Park, Corsham, Wiltshire, SN13 9GB Please ensure that the correct address is used. If you are unsure which data centre your service is provisioned in, contact UKCloud support who will be able to assist you. It is not the responsibility of the customer/partner or UKCloud to know the exact MMR rack locations of the telco providers. Telco providers do know this information and will be responsible for making sure that they capture this. Installation Telcos are responsible for organising directly with Ark to install their equipment in their racks in the MMR. Customers/partners are responsible for organising any colocation of customer/partner equipment with UKCloud. Important All equipment's onward connectivity to the UKCloud platform must be LC-LC fibre (multimode if HybridConnect or singlemode if CrownConnect). It is the responsibility of the partner/customer and telco to ensure that all equipment has the right interface to connect into UKCloud. UKCloud will not be held responsible for any financial penalty or delays in installation due to the wrong equipment interface being supplied by either the partner/customer or the telco. Demarcation Telcos are responsible for all telco owned equipment. This equipment must be installed within a telco rack within the Meet Me Room of the Ark datacentre and cannot be installed in a UKCloud rack. This includes all telco NTEs, CPEs and other equipment that is under the ownership and/or management responsibility of the telco. Ark are responsible for the connection between the telco kit and the patch panel for onward connectivity to UKCloud. UKCloud are responsible for the connection between the patch panel in the UKCloud data centre suites and the customer collocated equipment (if Cloud Enablement is being used) and/or the UKCloud infrastructure. The customer/partner is responsible for any customer owned equipment that has been installed in a UKCloud rack as part of a Cloud Enablement service. This includes installation, ongoing maintenance and emergency maintenance. Feedback If you find an issue with this article, click Improve this Doc to suggest a change.

    "keywords": "Internet access to the Elevated OFFICIAL security domain Overview UKCloud's Elevated OFFICIAL security domain is natively connected to secure government networks such as PSN Protected; there is no direct internet connectivity. If you want access to the internet, we operate an internet gateway service that enables limited access to internet resources from our Elevated security domain. The internet gateway isn't designed to support general web access, rich web applications or patch downloads. Instead, it's intended to facilitate access to basic web services such as postcode lookups, payment card authorisation, mapping data, and so on. Only white-labelled web services may be accessed via the gateway. Gaining access to the gateway To gain access to the gateway, raise a service request containing the following information: Business justification of the requirement The NFT or IP address(es) from which the requests will originate Details of the target for the request (including the full URLs and HTTP methods) HTTPS access is allowed, but the content must be decrypted so that it can be inspected. When a new client is provisioned, you'll be issued with the proxy RootCA certificate, which you need to install in your trusted root authority certificate store. The individual ProxyCA certificates can then be trusted by your application. Business justification review If internet access via the gateway is part of a Cross Domain Security Zone (CDSZ) submission, sign-off authorisation for it is given through the UKCloud assurance wrap process. For an individual request that isn't related to a CDSZ submission, we follow the steps below for sign off: We review the service request to see whether it overlaps with any previously approved requests. We carry out a review to see if the request types fall within the recommended criteria. We make a recommendation to the UKCloud Compliance team detailing whether the request should be approved or rejected. Compliance will approve as a checkpoint.

Overview An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) examines incoming network traffic to identify potential malicious activities, such as attempts to gain unauthorised access to an application or corrupt application data, and reports such attempts to a monitoring service. IDS for Assured OFFICIAL For Assured OFFICIAL solutions, we do not offer network IDS as part of our standard offering. We are planning to be able to enable network IDS as a cost option for customers who are buying additional Assured OFFICIAL Protective Monitoring from QinetiQ. Although our IDS solution can address activity based threats (such as port scans or SYN floods), it is less effective at addressing payload threats as the traffic is typically encrypted when it passes through our IDS solution. Hence, we recommend that customers implement their own application firewall, network IDS/IPS (within their virtual data centre) and/or host based IDS/IPS. In this way, customers have complete control over the policies and the resulting audit logs. Customers can also consider implementing a Content Delivery Network (CDN) in front of the UKCloud solution. All traffic will flow through the CDN, which often provides IDS/IPS features and can deal with issues such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. IDS for Elevated OFFICIAL For Elevated OFFICIAL solutions, we implement network IDS at our perimeter firewall and all logs are actively monitored via a GPG13 aligned Protective Monitoring service provided by QinetiQ (a UKCloud Alliance Partner). Although the solution can address activity based threats (such as port scans or SYN floods), it is less effective at addressing payload threats as the traffic is typically encrypted when it passes through our IDS solution.

    "title": "PSN for Policing and enhanced regime FAQs | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "PSN for Policing and enhanced regime FAQs What is PSN for Policing? The Public Services Network for Policing is a closed user group (CUG) operated by Vodafone over the PSN-A, using cryptographic overlays, connecting all UK police forces. Supplier CUGs are also available. What is the Enhanced Regime? The Enhanced Regime is sometimes referred to as the PSN in Policing (Protect), which is a set of controls over and above PSN-P encryption. It is generally used to exchange data between police and non-police organisations. Why are there two policing networks? The PSN-P is based on the IPED (Inter-Provider Encryption Domain) to enable multiple DNSPs to provide competition. The downside of this is that this introduces latency issues and throughput concerns. There are also a lot of non-police organisations on the PSN-P so police have less trust of this community. Due to this, non-police organisations will use the PSN-P with additional controls (Enhanced Regime), as this is easier to consume, but police will use the CUG over the PSN-A (PSN for Policing). Can data get between the PSN for Policing CUG and the Enhanced Regime? Yes. There are gateways, external to UKCloud, that allow data to traverse the two networks. This is managed and controlled by Vodafone. For questions relating to this gateway please contact Vodafone or the PSN for Policing Authority. How do I get on the PSN for Policing or the Enhanced Regime? You will need to contact the PSN for Policing Information Assurance team: ( information.assurance@homeoffice.pnn.police.uk ) The first stage is for Policing to confirm that there is a business requirement for the organisation (organisation/system/service) to connect to policing - so partners need a sponsoring force or department. Secondly it will be confirmed about how they should connect to Police. Then it should be confirmed that the supplier meets the necessary IA requirements. Design docs / RMADs / Code of Connection templates should be sent to the IA team - they review and then pass to GDS for approval. The supplier will then be granted code of connection by the PSN for Policing IA team. The supplier will need to liaise with UKCloud, Vodafone and the Home Office to get connectivity to the relevant network, as directed by the PSN for Policing Authority. Can I connect directly to the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL platform using a PSN for Policing CUG? Yes. Even though the PSN for Policing is an overlay on the PSN-A, the connection in will be installed as a private circuit into UKCloud, provided and managed by Vodafone. This means it can be terminated in the Elevated Cloud platform. Please see our HybridConnect FAQs for more information around connecting your own line into the UKCloud platform. Can I connect directly to the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL platform using the Enhanced Regime? Yes. The Enhanced Regime is a set of additional controls over the PSN-P, which terminates in the Elevated platform. Can I connect directly to the UKCloud Assured OFFICIAL platform using a PSN for Policing CUG? Yes. As the connection is installed as a private circuit into UKCloud, provided and managed by Vodafone, you can terminate it into the Assured Official platform. It is worth remembering that the PSN for Policing Authority may influence where this connection is terminated. Can I have a combination of government community networks and private accredited networks into the same UKCloud solution, including the PSN for Policing networks? Yes, subject to compliance with information assurance requirements, as only organisations that demonstrate compliance with the appropriate code of connections (for example PSN compliance certificate or approved N3 (IGSoC) can have access to government community networks. You should be careful not to misconfigure self-managed components of the solution (OS, application) to 'bridge' between government community networks (PSN) and private networks. This concern must be addressed by accreditation of the customer-managed components - preferably via PSN Accreditation. Local departmental accreditation by a public-sector customer is also allowed. This applies to solutions on both our Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platforms. What if I have been given some IPs for connection to the Enhanced Regime? You will need to liaise with Vodafone to ensure that these IPs are associated with your service within UKCloud. You may be asked by Vodafone for your circuit reference numbers, please raise a service request via the UKCloud portal to obtain these. You will then need to have these IPs added to your accounts, you can do this via a service request. UKCloud may need to work with Vodafone to advertise these IPs this process can take up to 10 days to facilitate. Once complete, you will then be able to provide your service over the new IPs. Can I swap out my existing PSN-P IPs for Enhanced Regime IPs? Yes. The process is the same as above except there may be an element of disruption to the service as the IP addresses are exchanged. You should liaise with UKCloud to find a suitable time to do this, to minimise any disruption. How do I get PSN for Policing or Enhanced Regime IP addresses? If you are connected to a PSN for Policing CUG then you will be provided with an IP range by Vodafone. If you are connected to the Enhanced Regime, then you will be provided an IP range by Home Office. You will need to raise a service request with us via the UKCloud Portal within the My Calls section to have these IPs added to the UKCloud firewalls. This may have a lead time of a few days. How long is the lead time to get a PSN for Policing network connected to my solution? This varies depending on the solution and the network you wish to connect to. It will take time to gain the accreditation needed through the PSN for Policing Authority, there will then be a lead time to get the connectivity provisioned into your solution. When connecting to a PSN for Policing CUG, you will need to wait for Vodafone to provision the connectivity into the UKCloud data centres. Because of this you will need to factor in an extended lead time. When connecting to the Enhanced Regime you will need to obtain IPs from the Home Office and have them made available to your solution by UKCloud. This will have a shorter lead time to implement that a CUG network, however it may still take a few weeks to do. How much does the PSN for Policing networks cost? The PSN for Policing CUG will be provided by Vodafone as a single-tenant installation so will be treated as a leased line. There will be Vodafone charges for this service that are outside of UKCloud's control. UKCloud will treat this as a HybridConnect service and will bill accordingly. For more information, please see the HybridConnect FAQs . The Enhanced Regime has additional controls over the PSN-P and as such customers will be billed in accordance with PSN-P pricing.

    "keywords": "N3 connectivity FAQs General Can I still connect to N3 on UKCloud? N3 is no longer generally available on UKCloud. HSCN is the replacement for N3 and connectivity is now available on UKCloud. New customers should connect straight to HSCN, existing customers should consider their migration strategy to HSCN before January 2019, when UKCloud will begin decomissioning N3. For more information about connecting to HSCN, please see the HSCN connectivity FAQs . What is N3? N3 is the NHS national network for healthcare. Technically the N3 does not exist anymore - officially it is known as the Transition Network, however it is still unofficially called N3. The N3 is being replaced by the Health and Social Care Network (HSCN). For more information, please see the HSCN connectivity FAQs . Considering the Health and Social Care Network (HSCN), when will N3 services cease? HSCN is now avaialble from UKCloud, and N3 is no longer available to purchase except in extenuating circumstances. N3 officially ceases to exist in August 2020, however in line with NHS Digital guidance for private organisations UKCloud will be terminating its N3 connection in January 2019 What does 'N3 aggregator' status mean to UKCloud? UKCloud achieved N3 aggregator status by meeting the strict information governance standards set by NHS Digital, which are required for all organisations that connect to N3. The process required detailed and extensive due diligence on our part to ensure we match or exceed specific security and information governance standards and experience required by the Department of Health. As an N3 aggregator, we can provide organisations with access to the N3, provided they have met the requirements of the UKCloud Assurance Process. This includes completion of the N3 connectivity application form. Our N3 aggregator status demonstrates our ability to serve the healthcare sector with a range of secure cloud services. Can I use UKCloud's N3 connection without using UKCloud's cloud services? No. We can provide an N3 connection only to customers who use our cloud services, such as our Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings. Does UKCloud provide local connections to the N3 network? No. We cannot arrange N3 connections to third-party offices. We only enable our customers and partners to provide services via the N3 network, using applications and solutions hosted on the UKCloud cloud platform. Do you have any general connectivity questions? You can find information about other connectivity methods and answers to general connectivity questions in the General Connectivity FAQs . Service Can UKCloud accept dedicated N3 connections? Yes. Our HybridConnect service option enables customers and partners to provide their own private circuits, including dedicated N3 connections. If you want a dedicated N3 connection to our cloud platform, our team can arrange for installation of dedicated N3 circuits to each of our UK data centres. In these cases, you must successfully complete the full NHS Digital information governance statement of compliance (IGSoC) process. What is the resilience of the UKCloud solution? The UKCloud assured cloud platform is connected to the N3 in geographically diverse locations. In the unlikely event of a circuit failure, we'll continue to provide connectivity to the N3 via our secure data centre interconnectivity and our secondary N3 connection. How will I be billed? Billing for N3 connectivity is monthly in arrears. Charges are included in your monthly invoice, along with charges for your UKCloud services. You can choose how you are charged: Per environment connected to N3 - £250 per connected environment Unlimited connections into environments - £3500 per month UKCloud pricing is available via the G-Cloud Digital Marketplace. Is there a minimum commitment period? UKCloud charges monthly for connectivity solutions, and requires a minimum commitment of one month for N3 connectivity. Can I vary my usage of the N3 connection? You can change your connectivity solution monthly by raising a Service Request via the UKCloud Portal . Will I incur an upfront cost (setup fee)? Simple implementations of the N3 network won't incur any additional setup or onboarding charges. For complex networking solutions, we reserve the right to charge SFIA rates. For example, applications that face both the N3 and the internet may require additional assistance to enable them on the N3, or a more extensive compliance engagement. We'll always tell you in advance if an engagement will incur SFIA rate card charges. Does UKCloud provide data encryption? The N3 is an unencrypted network and we don't provide additional data encryption. As governed by the UKCloud assurance process, you must encrypt the data within your applications, especially personally identifiable data (PID). We have partners who can help with application development to include data-at-rest and data-in-flight encryption. Can I use UKCloud's N3 connected service if I'm based outside England? No. At present only organisations located in England can use UKCloud's connection to the N3. This restriction unfortunately precludes organisations residing elsewhere in the UK (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) from using the UKCloud N3 connectivity service. If you're not based in England, please get in touch with us so we can discuss alternative methods of connection to the N3. Will I have full and unrestricted access to the entire N3 network? No. As part of the assurance process, you must indicate the specific access you require to and from the N3 network. We'll provide only the access you specify. If your requirements change over time, you'll need to raise a Service Request via the UKCloud Portal for any additional access. Process How do I get an N3-connected solution via the UKCloud assured cloud platform? To maintain the stringent information governance standards set by NHS Digital, we need to ensure that your solution has been appropriately designed, and that you can provide evidence of appropriate security controls. We do this through our assurance process which involves: An initial application for N3 connectivity, including business justification and scope A design review with a UKCloud Cloud Architect to ensure your solution includes appropriate technical controls An assurance/compliance review to ensure you can provide evidence of the supporting security controls Once you've successfully completed our assurance process for your N3-facing service, we'll enable your access to the N3 and provide an appropriate N3 IP address. How long does the assurance process take? The time taken will depend on your requirements and the level of discussions required with our compliance team. We'll enable your connection to the N3 within 48 hours of your successful completion of the assurance process. Do I need to contact NHS Digital to apply? As an N3 aggregator, UKCloud is the approving body in terms of customers meeting N3 compliance requirements. You'll also still need to register and complete a self‑assessment IGToolKit - details of how to do this are provided as part of the assurance process. We're an NHS organisation and already have an N3 connection, can I use it to connect UKCloud's services? Yes. A pre-existing connection to the N3 will reduce the amount of time and administrative overhead required to provide services via N3 on the UKCloud assured cloud platform. You'll need to provide us with your ODS code and we'll be able to connect your UKCloud service to the N3. You'll also need to contact NHS Digital once you have been allocated an IP address to request your route to be opened to the sites and services you need to access. We are a non-NHS customer who already have N3 connectivity, can we use your N3-connected cloud services? Yes. A pre-existing and compliant connection to the N3 will reduce the amount of time and administrative overhead required to provide services via the N3 based on the UKCloud assured cloud platform. Please provide us with your ODS code, ATP and Access Agreement Number and we'll be able to connect your UKCloud service to the N3. You'll also need to contact NHS Digital once you have been allocated an IP address to request your route to be opened to the sites and services you need to access. For further information, please contact your Cloud Architect who will provide guidance. I need a solution that's designed to face the N3 and an additional network. Can UKCloud help? Yes. As part of the assurance process, we can help with best-practice advice on designing solutions that face multiple networks. It's important to ensure your design doesn't compromise any other networks, or leave the possibility of unauthorised bridging. Usually, you'll need specific components of your solution to be dedicated to each network you want to use. Do I need an NHS sponsor to connect to UKCloud's N3? Yes. Any connection to the N3 requires an NHS sponsor, even if you're connecting via an aggregated service such as ours. Do I need to complete the assurance process for each N3 service I have on your cloud platform? Yes. For any new service, you must complete our assurance process. It may be possible to reuse existing documentation or evidence as part of the assurance process for any new service you order. Do you provide an SLA on N3 connectivity? We provide an SLA for availability of our core services such as UKCloud for VMware. We cannot provide an SLA on external services (such as the N3) as they are outside our control. UKCloud can only provide assurance associated with the native SLAs that are offered as part of the core N3 framework. How many N3 IP addresses will I be allocated? You will be given one IP address per connection with the N3 per UKCloud data centre. Any additional IP addresses will need to be justified. How do I justify the need for more IP addresses? As N3 addresses are in short supply, you must use your addresses as efficiently as possible. Before additional N3 addresses can be allocated, you'll need to demonstrate your use of: Load balancing services - enabling several web servers to be accessed via a single externally routable IP address Host headers - enabling web servers to accept connections for several URLs via a single externally routable IP address VPN tunnelling - enabling the use of internal (RFC 1918) IP addresses for non‑production services such as UAT AND development Is there a cost for additional N3 IP addresses? Yes. There is an administration fee of £20 for each additional N3 IP address. How can I whitelist source N3 IP addresses on the edge gateway? You can log into the UKCloud Portal and, within the edge gateway properties, edit the firewall settings to allow or deny incoming connections from external IP addresses. How does IP address allocation work on an N3 network for two front-end servers? You can implement this in two ways: Create an external org VDC network in which UKCloud routes from the ASA firewall. This can then be used for NAT to the N3 address. Use one of your public IP addresses, which is then translated (using NAT) on the ASA firewall. You can then use NAT rules on your edge gateway from an external org network as described in option 1. How does name resolution (DNS) happen on N3? There are two DNS servers on the N3 network. UKCloud permits access (outbound) on UDP port 53 for DNS queries. Feedback If you find an issue with this article, click Improve this Doc to suggest a change.

    "title": "HSCN connectivity FAQs | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "HSCN connectivity FAQs General What is HSCN? The Health and Social Care Network (HSCN) is the replacement for the N3, which is being phased out in March 2019. The HSCN is designed to provide a solution for hospitals, medical centres and GPs to collaborate and access services over a secure, high speed network. Like the N3, it will enable third-party software solutions to be presented to front-line patient care organisations. It is a government network like the PSN, but specifically designed for the health and social care community. When will HSCN be available from UKCloud? We'll be able to provide HSCN connectivity from June 2018. In the meantime, we can provide you with N3 connectivity and we'll contact you to arrange migration to HSCN from June 2018. Can I use UKCloud's HSCN connection without using UKCloud's cloud services? No. We can provide an HSCN connection only to customers who use our cloud services, such as our Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings. Does UKCloud provide local connections to the HSCN network? No. We can't arrange HSCN connections to third party offices. We only enable our customers and partners to provide services via the HSCN, using applications and solutions hosted on the UKCloud cloud platform. Do you have any answers to general connectivity questions? You can find information about other connectivity methods and answers to general connectivity questions in the General connectivity FAQs document on the UKCloud Portal. How do I get an HSCN connection from UKCloud? You must sign up to the terms of the HSCN Connection Agreement before you can have access to the HSCN: https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network/new-to-hscn/connecting-to-hscn If you think you have signed the Connection Agreement, go to https://crm.digital.nhs.uk/hscnconnectionagreementsearch/ and search either using your Organisation name or ODS code If you haven't yet received an invitation to complete your Connection Agreement, please contact enquiries@nhsdigital.nhs.uk to request access to their online portal Once you have access to the NHS Digital online portal, sign and submit your Connection Agreement to NHS Digital Alternatively, you can request a new UKCloud Master Services Agreement (MSA v11.0) which contains the flow-down of the HSCN Connection Agreement terms. If you sign and submit this, then you are automatically signing up to the terms of the Connection Agreement, and do not need to sign a separate Connection Agreement with NHS Digital. If you would like to sign the MSAv11.0 then please contact your Account Manager. UKCloud will validate that you have signed up to the terms of the HSCN Connection Agreement before connecting you to HSCN. Migration How do I migrate my existing UKCloud N3 workload onto HSCN? First you need to align with the HSCN Connection Agreement. You can do this by either signing your own Connection Agreement and having NHS Digital counter-sign. You can then supply us with a copy of it. Alternatively, you can sign the UKCloud Master Services Agreement (MSA version 11.0 onwards) and be covered by the flow-down of the Connection Agreement terms. Once you have a Connection Agreement in place, you will need to raise a service request for HSCN. We will give you a new Edge or Router with as many HSCN IPs as you are currently using for N3 assigned to it. You will be able to use this Edge and IP addresses to perform any testing that you require to validate the connectivity you require to support your application on the HSCN. Once you are comfortable with the HSCN you have two choices: You can create new application networks from your new HSCN Edge and connect to new NICs on your VMs to present your service over the new IPs. You can ask UKCloud to attach HSCN connectivity to your existing N3 Edge. When you are ready to migrate, you can ask UKCloud to change the Edge's Default Gateway from N3 to HSCN to cut over. Note that in both scenarios you will be responsible for VM routing configurations, Edge rules / security groups and DNS changes needed to move your service. There may be some connectivity downtime as you make the configuration changes in your environment and DNS changes on HSCN. When you are comfortable, we will decommission your N3 connection and your N3 Edge. How do I migrate my non-UKCloud N3 workload to HSCN on UKCloud? You have multiple ways of migrating your workload to UKCloud. One way to migrate to UKCloud is over the Internet, if your current environment has internet connectivity. Alternatively, you could migrate over N3. If you already have N3 approval, you may be eligible for N3 connectivity within UKCloud (see N3 FAQs for more details). You can then move your workload over to UKCloud via the N3 either by VM transfer or our Workload Migration service. (see How to migrate your workloads to the UKCloud platform for migrating your workloads to UKCloud). Once you have got your Connection Agreement terms in place, you can then have HSCN connectivity and can connect your VMs to HSCN. When you are comfortable, we will decommission your N3 connection. For more information about moving to UKCloud, please speak to your Cloud Architect. Will I be billed for HSCN and N3 connectivity at the same time while migrating? HSCN will be provided free for one month per connection for existing customers who are migrating existing UKCloud-hosted applications from N3 to HSCN. After one month, UKCloud reserves the right to begin charging for the HSCN connections unless the migration of an environment from N3 to HSCN cannot be completed within the month due to UKCloud being unable to provide a migration slot. Will there be additional costs for migration? Migration assistance in-hours (8am-8pm) will be done free-of-charge, if out-of-hours (8pm-8am) migration support is required then a SFIA rate for engineer time may be applied to the migration. Service Can UKCloud accept dedicated HSCN connections? Yes. Our HybridConnect service option enables customers and partners to provide their own private circuits, including dedicated HSCN connections. If you want a dedicated HSCN connection to our cloud platform, our team can arrange for installation of dedicated HSCN circuits to each of our UK data centres. In these cases, you must complete a HSCN Connection Agreement before we can implement connectivity. What is the resilience of the UKCloud solution? The UKCloud assured cloud platform is connected to the HSCN in geographically diverse locations. In the unlikely event of a circuit failure, we'll continue to provide connectivity to the HSCN via our secure data centre interconnectivity and our secondary HSCN connection. How will I be billed? Billing for HSCN connectivity is monthly in arrears. Charges are included in your monthly invoice, along with charges for your UKCloud services. We charge for each separate connection on the UKCloud platform at the Service vOrg/Project level UKCloud pricing is available via the G-Cloud Digital Marketplace Is there a minimum commitment period? UKCloud charges monthly for connectivity solutions, and requires a minimum commitment of one month for HSCN connectivity. Will I incur an upfront cost (setup fee)? Simple implementations of HSCN won't incur any additional setup or onboarding charges. For complex networking solutions, we reserve the right to charge SFIA rates. We'll always tell you in advance if an engagement will incur SFIA rate card charges. Does UKCloud provide data encryption? The HSCN is an unencrypted network and we don't provide additional data encryption. You must encrypt the data within your applications, especially personally identifiable data (PID), with an AES256 level of encryption. Can I use UKCloud's HSCN connected service if I'm based outside of England? No. At present only organisations located in England can use UKCloud's connection to the HSCN. This restriction unfortunately precludes organisations residing elsewhere in the UK (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) from using the UKCloud HSCN connectivity service. If you're not based in England, please get in touch with us so we can discuss alternative methods of connection to the HSCN. Will I have full and unrestricted access to the entire HSCN network? You will have unrestricted access to the HSCN but you may not be able to access any services presented onto HSCN until you have reached an agreement with the supplier of those services. Process What has happened to your status as 'N3 Aggregator'? UKCloud achieved N3 aggregator status by meeting the strict information governance standards set by NHS Digital, which were required for all organisations that connect to N3. With HSCN, this changes slightly. We will be an HSCN aggregator but will no longer need to take you through an aggregation process to connect you to HSCN. Once you are aligned with the HSCN Connection Agreement terms, either by signing your own agreement, or by signing to UKCloud's terms, we will connect you to our aggregated HSCN connection. How do I get an HSCN-connected solution via the UKCloud assured cloud platform? You can get HSCN connectivity in one of two ways. Sign your own Connection Agreement, have this counter-signed by NHS Digital and then send us a copy Sign up to UKCloud's MSA (version 11.0 onwards) as a consumer of our services and we cover you with the flow-down of the Connection Agreement terms. No need to get NHS Digital to counter-sign an Agreement. Do either of these and we'll enable your access to the HSCN and provide an appropriate HSCN IP address. How long does the Connection Agreement process take? If you get your own Connection Agreement then the time taken will depend on NHS Digital's speed of counter-signing your Connection Agreement. If you simply sign up to the Agreement flow-down through UKCloud's MSA then it only takes as long as it would for an order to be processed. We'll enable your connection to the HSCN within one working day of your successful completion of the assurance process. Do I need to contact NHS Digital to apply? If you want to sign your own Connection Agreement then yes, you do. However, you can be covered through the flow-down of the Agreement in UKCloud's MSA, in which case, you don't. We're an NHS organisation and already have an HSCN connection, can I use it to connect UKCloud's services? Yes. You'll need to provide us with your Connection Agreement and we can then provide you HSCN connectivity. You may also need to contact NHS Digital once you have been allocated an IP address to change any DNS records. We are a non-NHS customer who already have HSCN connectivity, can we use your HSCN-connected cloud services? Yes. Simply show us your Connection Agreement and we'll be able to connect your UKCloud service to the HSCN. You may also need to contact NHS Digital once you have been allocated an IP address to change any DNS records. I need a solution that's designed to face the HSCN and an additional network. Can UKCloud help? ** Yes. We can help with best-practice advice on designing solutions that face multiple networks. It's important to ensure your design doesn't compromise any other networks, or leave the possibility of unauthorised bridging. Usually, you'll need specific components of your solution to be dedicated to each network you want to use. Do I need an NHS sponsor to connect to UKCloud's HSCN? You won't need a sponsor to connect to HSCN, however you may need a sponsor to connect to HSCN-connected services such as Spine or Emis. Do I need to complete a Connection Agreement for each HSCN service I have on your cloud platform? No. you only need one signed Connection Agreement or UKCloud's terms and conditions to present multiple services to HSCN. However, you may need to create an accreditation pack for each individual service to present to the Information Accreditors who are looking at the security of your application before customers will procure it. Do you provide an SLA on HSCN connectivity? We provide an SLA for availability of our core services such as Enterprise Compute Cloud. We cannot provide an SLA on external services (such as the HSCN) as they are outside our control. UKCloud can only provide assurance associated with the native SLAs that are offered as part of the core HSCN framework. How many HSCN IP addresses will I be allocated? You will be given one (1) useable IP address per HSCN Edge/router. Any additional IP addresses will need to be justified and are an additional cost. You can be allocated up to 5 IP addresses per connection. If you require more than 5 IPs per connection you will need to request additional IPs from NHS Digital and we can advertise them on your behalf. How do I justify the need for more IP addresses? As IPv4 addresses are in short supply, you must use your addresses as efficiently as possible. Before additional HSCN addresses can be allocated, you will need to demonstrate your use of: Load balancing services - enabling several web servers to be accessed via a single externally routable IP address Host headers - enabling web servers to accept connections for several URLs via a single externally routable IP address VPN tunnelling - enabling the use of internal (RFC 1918) IP addresses for non-production services such as UAT AND development Is there a cost for additional HSCN IP addresses? Yes. There is an administration fee of £20 for each additional HSCN IP address. How can I whitelist source HSCN IP addresses on the edge gateway?

You can then use NAT rules on your edge gateway from an external org network as described in option 1. How does name resolution (DNS) happen on HSCN? There are two DNS servers on the HSCN network which is looked after by the NHS Digital DNS team. UKCloud permits access (outbound) on UDP port 53 for DNS queries. To request a DNS change, please email dnsteam@nhs.net , who require the following information: Domains that you wish to change. Old IP address(es). New IP address(es). Date and Time of Change. We recommend a couple of days lead time as there may be scheduling issues, though these can be waived in emergencies. Please note that IP changes are NOT instantaneous and may take some time to propagate fully. We can do out of hours changes for NHS customers Feedback If you find an issue with this article, click Improve this Doc to suggest a change.

    "title": "Application-tuned DDoS protection FAQs | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Application-tuned DDoS protection FAQs What is Application-tuned DDoS Protection? Application-tuned DDoS protection from Neustar is a fully-managed DDoS protection solution, backed by an industry-leading security operations team, that scrubs your website's malicious traffic to ensure only clean, legitimate traffic is delivered to your site. It's available in multiple deployment configurations to meet your needs and is flexible depending on your specific requirements. The cloud-based service mitigates attacks in the cloud, far away from your infrastructure, with the bandwidth and flexibility to repel today's largest attacks. Using proven methodologies, Neustar's experienced DDoS fighters intelligently match technology to threats, surgically derailing even the most complex attacks. The always-on hybrid managed solution removes the burden of DDoS with an on-site Arbor appliance for smaller DDoS attacks, combined with cloud-based failover for larger, sustained attacks. Remote management of monitoring, detecting and responding to DDoS attacks minimises downtime and frees your valuable resources. Who supplies the DDoS service? The Application-tuned DDoS service is supplied and managed by Neustar. Who is Neustar? Founded in 1996, Neustar, Inc. (NYSE: NSR) is a trusted, neutral provider of real-time information and analysis to the internet, telecommunications, entertainment, advertising and marketing industries throughout the world. Neustar delivers real-time information and analytics for over 6 billion physical and virtual addresses, provides instantaneous answers to more than 27 billion queries from the internet each day, and answers over 300,000 questions every second. How is this different from standard UKCloud DDoS protection? Our standard DDoS protection is aimed at protecting all consumers on our cloud platform as a 'break glass' solution. It is a 'blunt instrument', as the counter-measures we deploy will primarily protect the community of users first and foremost, which may debilitate the customer who is being attacked. Although only public sector organisations use our cloud platform, there's a wide variety of uses, traffic types from different geographic locations, and varying traffic patterns and throughput. Because of these factors, we advise customers to consider DDoS protection that can be customised for their unique traffic and application use, to ensure uptime and minimise disruption. How is it set up? For internet-bound traffic, we manage an autonomous Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) service, which enables us to intelligently redirect traffic without affecting a customer's IP address allocation. Would the use of this DDoS service cause any disruption to live services? There should be no disruption during your move to the DDoS service, unless your applications are currently under attack. How do I make changes to my DDoS settings? Once the service has been provisioned, you'll receive access details for the customer portal. Via the portal you can supply all relevant information and adjust the settings of the service to suit your needs, expected traffic, and actions in the event of a suspected DDoS attack. How do I get support? Support is made available by Neustar directly. Is there a charge for this service? Yes, there's a one-off setup fee of £3,000, and a £5,000 per-month recurring charge, with a 12-month minimum-term contract. If we use SSL tunnels, will they terminate with Neustar? This depends on the whether they are BGP or DNS: BGP - tunnels - do not terminate at the customer server. DNS without SSL certificate - tunnels terminate at the customer server and Neustar uses SSL pass-through in the proxy. DNS with SSL certificate - tunnels terminate at the scrubbing location as Neustar holds the certificate. An additional tunnel is set up between the scrubbing centre and the server. Can pre-existing IP addresses be moved, or would new IP addresses be needed? This depends on whether they are BGP or DNS: BGP - existing IP addresses can be used. DNS - virtual IP addresses will be used when under mitigation. DNS redirect is done via a proxy so A records will need to be changed to move to the DDoS service.

    "title": "How to install CloudArray | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to install CloudArray Overview CloudArray is a fully integrated appliance which uses object storage (raw unorganised storage on a disk) and exposes it as a network share. It presents itself as file storage to users but uses a mix of object storage and metadata behind the scenes. How does CloudArray work As CloudArray is a fully integrated appliance, you don't have to spend money and resources managing operating systems for the solutions. It uses a combination of object storage and a local cache reserve to provide unlimited storage with near local storage performance, using the cache to store frequently used files locally, while asynchronously replicating data to UKCloud's Cloud Storage platform. CloudArray also supports Amazon's REST S3 API to expand on-premises SANs and NAS solutions with on-demand elastic cloud capacity. Tip If you do not need the features of CloudArray such as deduplication and location caching, or do not require a fully-integrated cloud gateway appliance, you may want to consider the GeoDrive Client 2.0 as an alternative. Use cases Potential use cases for CloudArray include: Storage on mass using UKCloud Cloud Storage Move infrequently accessed data to low-cost cloud tiers (typically object storage is much slower compared to block or file storage as it functions on a request basis) Assurance that data synchronised to the cloud is encrypted both in transit and at rest System requirements Supported hypervisors CloudArray supports the following hypervisors: VMware vSphere 5.5 (ESXi) or higher Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 with Hyper-V [!NOTE] The hypervisor must support 64 bit Linux OS guest operating systems. RAM, CPU and disk requirements To run CloudArray Virtual Edition you must have the following minimum resources: 60 GB of disk space 1 virtual processor assigned to the CloudArray VE (two virtual processors is recommended) 8 GB of RAM for the 3 TB base model For specific details about memory requirements, see EMC CloudArray Best Practices . Supported host operating systems CloudArray supports the following operating systems: Mac OS X OpenSolaris 2009.06 Red Hat Linux: 4.0 and higher SUSE Linux: 10, 11 VMware ESX or ESXi Windows: XP, Vista, 7, 8, Server 2003, 2008, 2012 Supported web browsers CloudArray supports the browsers: Google Chrome v49 or higher Microsoft Edge v25 or higher Internet Explorer v11 or higher Mozilla Firefox v45 or higher Safari for Mac v6.1.6 or higher Network port requirements CloudArray allows network traffic on the following TCP/IP ports: 80 (HTTP) 111 (NFS Portmapper TCP/UDP) 137, 138, 139 (CIFS) 443 (HTTPS) 445 (CIFS) System requirements: 662 (NFS Status TCP/UDP) 875 (NFS rquotad TCP/UDP) 892 (NFS mountd TCP/UDP) 2049 (NFS nfsd TCP/UDP) 3260 (iSCSI) 8080 (HTTP) 32803 (NFS nlockmgr TCP) 41022 (EMC Support) Memory sharing Memory for a CloudArray virtual machine must be provisioned for its exclusive use. CloudArray is a memory-intensive application. Substantial performance degradation is likely if other virtual machines share the memory allocated to CloudArray. Obtaining a CloudArray license If you require a CloudArray license key, UKCloud will contact Dell EMC on your behalf. Contact your Technical Account Manager (TAM) for further details. Installing CloudArray Virtual Edition The steps for installing CloudArray depend on your hypervisor: VMware vSphere Microsoft Hyper-V Installing CloudArray on VMware vSphere To install CloudArray on VMware: Login to the EMC CloudArray portal . Click Downloads & Documents . From the list in My Downloads , select download , and extract the CloudArray package. Import the OVF file into your hypervisor. [!NOTE] The VM is configured for two networks but only one is required. However, we strongly recommend that you connect two interfaces. Use one interface for cloud traffic and the second for iSCSI/CIFS/NFS and management traffic. For VMware ESX or ESXi complete the following steps, otherwise proceed to the next numbered step. a. Open the vSphere Client and log in using your credentials. b. Once the client opens, select File > Import OVF Template c. Browse to the folder where you extracted the contents of the downloaded CloudArray zip file and choose the .ovf file. Then click Next . d. Enter a name for the virtual machine or leave it unchanged, then click Next . e. Review the summary screen and click Finish to begin the importing process. f. A success message displays upon completion. Power on the CloudArray virtual machine. Go to Configuring CloudArray . Installing CloudArray on Microsoft Hyper-V To install CloudArray on Microsoft Hyper-V: Log in to the EMC CloudArray portal . Click Downloads & Documents . From the list in My Downloads , select download , and extract the CloudArray package. Download and extract the CloudArray.zip file to a location of your choice. [!NOTE] We recommend that you extract the file to the machine running the graphical user interface for the hypervisor on which you'll be installing CloudArray as this will minimize the VM import time. Import the VM into your hypervisor. [!NOTE] The VM is configured for two networks but only one is required. However, we strongly recommend that you connect two interfaces. Use one interface for cloud traffic and the second for iSCSI/CIFS/NFS and management traffic. Open Hyper-V Manager on the windows host where you plan to deploy the CloudArray VM. Select Action > Import Virtual Machine . Complete the following fields. a. Browse to the root folder where you extracted the VM files. b. Select the \"Copy the virtual machine\" radio button. c. Check the \"Duplicate all files\" check box if you plan to deploy this VM to multiple hypervisors. Click Import . The import process begins and might take some time to complete. A status bar indicates the progress. After the VM is imported, start the virtual machine. Go to Configuring CloudArray . Configuring CloudArray You have two options to configure CloudArray: Using the CloudArray Appliance console Using the web browser interface Configuring CloudArray using the CloudArray Appliance console Starting the console To start the CloudArray Appliance console: You can use Hypervisor to access the CloudArray Appliance console. Click Sign in and enter the following credentials: Username: admin Password: <admin_password> Upon first login, you are prompted to change the password. [!NOTE] CloudArray attempts to find a DHCP server the first time it boots. If not successful, you'll see Getting Started Web Page: http://No IP assigned. In that case, refer to Configuring the network to set an initial IP address. You can then use the Network Tools feature in the CloudArray GUI to finish configuring the adapters. Choose the desired operation from the CloudArray Appliance console display. The CloudArray Appliance console enables you to set the network configuration, manage CloudArray services, restart the appliance and perform diagnostic tests.

    "title": "UKCloud for VMware Service Scope | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "UKCloud for VMware Service Scope About this document This document describes the boundaries of the UKCloud for VMware service, along with the division of responsibilities between UKCloud and the customer, to facilitate the provisioning and ongoing use of the service. About UKCloud for VMware The UKCloud for VMware service provides a secure, scalable and cost-effective platform for hosting virtual machines (VMs) of various sizes with different service levels. You can use the platform to build new services quickly and securely; and migrate, augment or transform existing applications. The platform is immediately available so you can provision and scale VMs in minutes. Service architecture Your UKCloud service architecture is as follows: Company. Your contract with UKCloud is associated with a company, which provides a single owner for the contract, regardless of how many accounts are created. Account. We use accounts to separate financial ownership. An account could represent an organisation, a customer contract, or a specific project. An account can also have several UKCloud services associated with it, such as UKCloud for VMware, Cloud Storage and UKCloud for OpenStack. You can also use accounts to separate users based on access requirements or permissions. Organisation (vOrg). This represents your UKCloud for VMware service inside vCloud Director and on the UKCloud Portal. There is a 1:1 mapping of service to vOrg. Virtual data centre (VDC). A VDC is where you define your workload type and build your virtual machines (VMs). You can create VDCs through the UKCloud Portal or the Portal API. Service options You can build a tailored solution to meet your requirements by mixing and matching service options. The choice does not lock you to one service or size, allowing you to scale resources up or down as your requirements change. Workload type. Workload type | Resource allocation | Automated Rebalancing -- -----------|---------------------|---------------------- ESSENTIAL | Contended | Configured to meet requested performance POWER | Uncontended (CPU/GiB) | Pre-emptively optimises performance and availability PRIORITY |Uncontended (CPU/GiB) | Configured to reduce workload movement around the platform, reducing workload disruption VM size. There are 11 T-shirt sizes available for VMs, with varying vCPU and RAM configurations, ranging from 1vCPU and 512MiB RAM to 12vCPUs and 128GiB RAM. You can change the size of your VMs after creation through vCloud Director. Full details of the available service options are outlined in the Service Definition . Storage options All workloads (except micro) include 60GiB of Tier 2 storage for free, all storage is persistent and resilient to local hardware failures. Micro sized VMs include 10GiB of Tier 2 storage. Additional storage can be purchased to support your application. Multiple storage options can be used to support different aspects of the application. Tier 1. Our most performant block storage for workloads requiring consistently higher disk throughput. Tier 2. Persistent block storage with typical performance characteristics for use by production applications or storage. Storage policies We provide you with access to two storage policies: tier 1 and tier 2. Both policies have a 10TiB quota of storage to allow for rapid expansion of services as required. We do not guarantee storage performance, as it can be affected by many factors We do not provide IOPs figures for our storage offerings Workloads can use multiple storage profiles Micro sized VMs have a fixed allocation of 10GiB of Tier 2 storage which cannot be increased Protection Customers have a range of automated, on-platform protection options to choose from for their environments: Catalogue and template-based recovery. All customers have access to catalogue and template-based recovery as standard. This is a configuration management solution that can re-provision stateless servers to a new VM when required, using standard, and catalogue-based VM templates. Snapshot Protection. 14-day or 28-day snapshot policies available. Data protected by the snapshot has an RPO of 24 hours, with RTO determined by the time taken to restore the VM after the service request is raised. See the Snapshot Protection Service Scope for full details. Journaling Protection. A non-invasive, self-service disaster recovery solution with configurable recovery points, providing near real-time data protection. The standard journaling profile provides a target RPO of 5 minutes and a journal history of 2, 7, 14 or 28 days. The Journaling Protection Service Scope covers the full details of this protection option. Service availability UKCloud platform availability is based on the workload type you purchase. The service level agreement (SLA) for POWER workloads guarantees 99.99% availability. ESSENTIAL and PRIORITY workload SLAs guarantee 99.95% availability. You are entitled to claim Service Credits for outages to services that take you out of SLA. For more about how we calculate SLAs, see the SLA Definition . Service background We maintain the standard VM template sizes that control allocation of CPU and resources. VMs are fully provisioned. The system is configured to automatically balance resources, so your VMs may vMotion between physical hosts. PRIORITY workloads are configured to reduce movement around the platform. To maintain performance across the platform, UKCloud can perform movements/migrations of VMs, vApps or storage within the infrastructure assigned to a service. We actively capacity-manage the cloud platform to ensure you have access to the resources you request. The UKCloud platform is designed using sites, regions and zones. The relationship between them is shown below: You can specify Farnborough or Corsham as the site where you would like to have your service provisioned. We will try to accommodate requests and will advise you if we are unable do so. We control the deployed versions of technology on the platform. This covers internal platform-supporting technologies, and any technology versions available to you. Internally this includes, but isn't limited to, the vSphere and ESX versions, and the hardware version of the platform. Externally this includes the available versions of the edge gateway and vCloud Director. Promiscuous mode is disabled. You can set affinity or anti-affinity rules through vCloud Director so that VMs do, or do not, run on the same physical host. You can make additional configurations inside a VM (such as acting as a secondary hypervisor or implementing third-party software technologies). We do not support customer implementations inside a VM. Operating systems Licensing. We can provide: OS licensing through the SPLA and academic frameworks for Microsoft Red Hat Enterprise Linux licensing For the latest available licences, please check the Service Definition and the Pricing Guide . You can bring your own licensing for Red Hat and certain Microsoft application licensing under Microsoft Mobility using software assurance. You should inform UKCloud via a Service Request if you're providing your own licensing for a retrospective discount. For non-UKCloud issued software, you must obey the licensing requirements of the software provider. This includes being aware of any constraints around using the software in a virtualised environment. VM server images. We provide base VM images for the operating systems (OS) for which we provide licensing. You can access these from vCloud Director. You can use your own images for non-Windows and RHEL services, where licensing stipulates that to use the VM on our platform it must be licensed (and reported back to the software vendor) by UKCloud. Update services. We make update repositories available for all software for which we provide licensing. We don't provide software update facilities for non-UKCloud licensed software. Anti-virus. We do not provide anti-virus software as part of the service. Networks A full overview of the connectivity options and network architecture is available in Understanding connectivity options in UKCloud for VMware . We manage the physical firewalls that face public and secure networks. Internet-facing solutions have 2 usable public IP addresses. You can ask for additional public IP addresses via a Service Request. We reserve the right to decline the request if you have spare capacity in your existing deployment. PSN-facing solutions. You should raise a Service Request or contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM) to be assigned your IP address. Contended bandwidth (uncapped). Janet and HSCN solutions have one usable IP address. You can request additional IP addresses via a Service Request. From a customer management experience, you manage all your connectivity rules, such as firewall, IPsec VPN and NAT functionality, through your edge gateway, using either the UKCloud Portal GUI or API. Edge gateway (previously vShield Edge) By default, we assign one edge gateway per connectivity type. For VDCs you create through the Portal API, you are responsible for creating your own edge gateway. You can have up to nine Org VDC networks per edge gateway. vApp edge. vApp networks allow you to create smaller networks within individual vApps which have a vApp Edge, similar to the edge gateway on your VDC. Although a vApp Edge isn't as feature rich as an edge gateway, it lets you create firewall and NAT rules to separate your VDC networks from your vApp virtual machines (VMs). See vApp networking for configuration details. Site-to-site IPsec VPN. You can create IPsec VPN tunnels to connect the services located behind different NFTs. You can also externally configure IPsec VPNs. There is a limit of 64 tunnels per edge gateway. SSL VPN. You can create SSL VPN tunnels that terminate on the edge gateway, providing up to 50 concurrent users with access to that VDC. We recommend you use this for occasional administrative purposes, rather than as part of a regular end-user design. Load balancing. The edge gateway acts as a basic layer 3 load balancer, including features such as session persistence and health checks. If you need more advanced load balancing, you should consider a third-party product. Bring Your Own Firewall Bring Your Own Firewall allows you to customise your networking infrastructure by installing your own virtual firewall appliance in place of the edge gateway included as standard. We don't offer a rebate for unused edges. If you choose to bring your own firewall, you are completely responsible for the deployment, configuration and management of that firewall. If you change from a UKCloud-provided firewall to your own firewall, we will redeploy your firewall on to a dedicated network and you will need to migrate your environment to that network. Full customer and UKCloud responsibilities can be found in the Bring Your Own Firewall Service Scope . Protective monitoring We have implemented GPG 13-aligned Protective Monitoring across the Assured and Elevated platforms at the hypervisor level and below. We don't provide Protective Monitoring services above the hypervisor (for example, for your VM) - it is your responsibility to act at this level. In line with UKCloud's SISP, we provide notification of customer-impacting security incidents. It is your responsibility to report similar incidents to us. Platform management Users can access, manage and view the UKCloud for VMware service, accessing only those features allowed by their role, in any of the following ways: vCloud Director API. Enables the programmatic creation and management of VMs inside the platform. vCloud Director graphical UI. Provides a graphical interface to access the vCloud Director environment (depending on assigned permissions). UKCloud Portal. Enables the creation of compute services and subsequently VDCs and edge gateways. The Portal also includes an overview of actual and estimated spend, along with service configuration information. Access to service reporting and incident and request management is also possible through the Portal. You cannot access the underlying infrastructure. This includes (but isn't limited to) the hardware and the vSphere environment. Service migration You can move your workloads from a local VMware or Hyper-V powered environment onto the UKCloud platform using Migration to the Cloud (powered by Zerto). You can find pricing information in the Pricing Guide . Customers are free to migrate their workloads. You can also request a migration through a Service Request. Migrations may be between: Services (for example, ESSENTIAL to POWER) UKCloud sites or zones The Assured and Elevated security domains Service reporting Visibility. We provide a monthly service report via the UKCloud Portal. This includes a summary of platform availability and a retrospective of the interactions with UKCloud support during the previous month. Maintenance notifications and Service Status reports are also delivered through the Portal. Service reporting. All service reporting is done via the UKCloud Portal. Billing. We provide you with monthly bills covering your monthly spend. Customer service Customer Success Manager (CSM). For the first 90 days of the service, you have access to a UKCloud Customer Success Manager, who will help you with your adoption of the UKCloud UKCloud for VMware service, including finding relevant systems and using UKCloud tools and processes. Cloud Architects. UKCloud Cloud Architects support you during the design of solutions for the cloud platform. UKCloud Cloud Architects are ideally placed to help reconcile your requirements with the UKCloud platform. We recommend engagement with a Cloud Architect when implementing complex solutions, such as those using HybridConnect or a Walled Garden. Technical Account Managers (TAM). You will be allocated with an assigned point of contact who will provide ongoing assistance with reporting and incident escalation. Support. After the initial on-boarding and design phase, you can utilise the standard UKCloud support entitlement, which is documented in the Customer Engagement Factsheet . Customer responsibilities You are responsible for assessing whether the UKCloud platform can support the various requirements of your application. The control and management of access and responsibilities for end users including appropriate connectivity, security and accreditation if required. If access is required over government secure networks (HSCN, Janet, RLI or PSN), the customer is responsible for adhering to the relevant Code of Connection (CoCo) and for providing evidence of their CoCo to UKCloud upon request. UKCloud is unable to provide access to secure networks where such evidence has not been provided by the customer. Management and administration of layers above the hypervisor (OS patching, application performance monitoring, user administration). The customer is also responsible for ensuring only lawful data that supports the UK public sector is stored and processed by applications on this environment, and that they fully comply with the UKCloud Security Operating Procedures (SyOPs) and other information assurance requirements as specified in the UKCloud System Interconnect and Security Policy (SISP) and associated accreditation documentation sets. Service provisioning Within 4 hours of accepting an order (shorter deployment times are typically achieved and can be prioritised upon request), UKCloud will create the customer's Primary Administrator account and send a Welcome Pack which includes the URL for the UKCloud Customer Portal, and the getting started guide. Customers can self-provision UKCloud for VMware services via the UKCloud Portal or the Portal API. UKCloud has created several videos, help guides, manuals and FAQs to help train and instruct users so that they are up and running quickly and easily. These are available within the Knowledge Centre . In addition, you will be assigned a Customer Success Manager (CSM) to provide any assistance required during the first 90 days of the service. UKCloud also has a large ecosystem of partners who can deliver additional services, such as support and professional services. UKCloud would be pleased to introduce you to the right partner to suit your needs. Service constraints UKCloud will adhere to the following in terms of maintenance windows: \"Planned Maintenance\" means any pre-planned disruptive maintenance to any of the infrastructure relating to the service. Planned Maintenance activity may result in periods of degradation or loss of availability depending on the nature of the activity required. In such cases, UKCloud shall provide affected customers with at least fourteen (14) days' notice of the Planned Maintenance. If during Planned Maintenance there is a loss of availability outside the scope described in the planned maintenance notification to the service, an SLA event will be triggered. For ESSENTIAL and POWER services this event will count in SLA calculations. For VMs running as a PRIORITY configuration, this time will be excluded from the availability calculation but will be included in monthly service reporting related to the service. \"Emergency Maintenance\" means any urgent maintenance required to prevent or mitigate against any event compromising the infrastructure relating to the service. Whenever possible, UKCloud shall: a) provide affected customers with at least six (6) hours' advance notice and b) carry out the emergency maintenance between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Friday or between the hours of Saturday 00:00 to 06:00 (UK local time) on Monday, (including bank holidays) unless there is an identified and demonstrable immediate risk to customer environment(s). Emergency Maintenance may result in periods of degradation or loss of availability depending on the nature of the activity required. If during Emergency Maintenance there is a loss of availability to the service, an SLA event will be triggered. This time will be excluded from the availability calculation but will be included in monthly service reporting related to the service.

    "title": "Synchronous Protection Service Scope | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Synchronous Protection Service Scope About this document This Service Scope explains what is and isn't included in the scope of the UKCloud for VMware Synchronous Protection service option. Synchronous Protection is one of a variety of on‑platform protection options available from UKCloud. Use this service scope to understand what Synchronous Protection offers and whether it will meet your own recovery point objectives (RPO) and recovery time objectives (RTO). Note Synchronous Protection is no longer available as a protection option for UKCloud for VMware. UKCloud offer two alternative data protection solutions: Journaling Protection (Zerto) and Snapshot Protection . Contact your Technical Account Manager (TAM) for more information. We will continue to provide support to customers who previously added Synchronous Protection to their environment, although we would encourage considering using Journaling Protection instead. About Synchronous Protection The UKCloud for VMware Synchronous Protection service option is designed to offer geographical protection of your live environments across both of our sites (Farnborough and Corsham; 60 miles apart). To achieve this, we utilise synchronous replication between sites to ensure that any changes made to your environment are committed to arrays in both sites before the write is confirmed as being complete to the VM OS. Synchronous Protection provides a replica of data (for any data written, and flushed to disk) and then enables the ability to migrate your VMs between the sites while they are running, offering a greater level of protection for live environments. Your service is only ever presented out of one of these sites (a VM exists in only one location at a time), but a synchronous copy between the sites ensures that an exact copy is stored in the second site, which can be brought online, with zero data loss, in the event of a failure. Synchronous Protection availability Synchronous Protection is currently available in regions 1, 2, 7 and 8. Design Synchronous Protection is an active‑passive solution. The solution offers failover to a second UK site, however your VM will be active in only one site at any given time. Customers relying on a single virtual firewall in their primary site should be aware that in some circumstances, such as a failure of the inter-site network, or of the customer's primary virtual firewall, access to their solution will be lost. If you require an active‑active solution, you can build across both sites and design in load balancing. Contact your Account Manager if you want to investigate this option. If a failure affects several VMs, they will be restarted in no particular order. We do not offer any controls to programmatically manage this - in most scenarios, the restart is automatic. If you need your VMs or vApps to be started in a particular order, we recommend that you restart them manually. Within each site we've architected a platform with a minimum of N+1 resilience, including routers and switches. RPO and RTO Synchronous Protection provides a disaster recovery service with an RPO of almost 0 seconds. The RTO is variable and will be influenced by factors such as your application design and the ability to failover networks. For clarity, this product does not use asynchronous replication technologies. The recovery point is the last write to disk with no historical recovery points (there is no ability to \"roll back\" to a previous version). If asynchronous replication with historical recovery points is required, consider Journaling Protection . Unplanned failover process We monitor the underlying physical infrastructure including the blades, routers and switches. There are a variety of scenarios that can trigger an unplanned failover event. In the majority of scenarios, failover activities are automatic. In scenarios such as multiple component failure, including loss of redundancy, in the majority of cases your VMs and edge gateway instances will be automatically brought online, either on an alternative physical device in the same site or in the second site. This is dependent on available resources. However, other scenarios can result in a full or partial failover, and in these cases we'll need to react differently. Manual failover In some scenarios a full automated failover will not be possible. In each case the remedial actions may be different, and we have a variety of tools, such as VMware vMotion and VMware Storage vMotion, that we can utilise to return your VMs to service. In the case that a site failover is not automatically completed, we use the entry criteria below to ascertain if there is a need for a manual failover. If a need is established, we review the technical considerations to ensure and validate the decision for a manual failover is both safe and appropriate. Entry criteria Yes/No Incident is site specific Outlook for recovery more than two hours Technical considerations Yes/No Control plane availability Storage consistency VM to VM network availability External network availability Entry criteria explained Are the service conditions met to confirm the need for a manual failover? Incident is site specific - An incident must be site specific (either Farnborough or Corsham). In the unlikely event the incident effects both sites, a manual failover will be unlikely to resolve the issue so will not be considered. Outlook for recovery more than two hours - In the event that a failover is not automatic, we'll conduct an initial technical investigation to identify the cause of the failure. This technical investigation is time‑boxed to two hours (including time to recover the service). If at any point in this assessment the outlook for recovery of normal service is deemed unlikely by the end of the time box, the issue will undergo technical consideration for a manual failover. Technical considerations explained If a failure meets the entry criteria described in the section above, we'll assess if there are any technical reasons preventing the initialisation of a manual failover. If these technical conditions are not met, a manual failover will not be attempted. But we'll continue to work to bring your VMs back online in the shortest possible timeframe. At any point in the technical assessment, we may return to considering a manual failover. Control plane availability - The control plane is defined as the platform for managing the environment (by us or by you). If the control plane is wholly unavailable, then our ability to execute a failover and manage the infrastructure will be compromised. Therefore, a failover would not be immediately possible. Storage consistency - This check is to ensure the data is available and consistent. Geo‑resilient storage is distributed evenly across a SAN spanning both UKCloud sites and is managed by vPlex. If the underlying SAN becomes compromised, VMs may lose connectivity with their data store. If the data is not consistent, a failover event will not be initiated. VM to VM network availability - This check is to ensure inter‑VM communication is functional and consistent. If a physical appliance such as a host fails, VMs may be relocated to restore connectivity and is unlikely to require a full site failover. If a virtual appliance such as a vShield Edge fails, failover may not resolve the issue and would potentially deviate technical resources from the recovery of the incident. External network availability - This check is to ensure external communication to the wider community is functional and consistent. This is specific to UKCloud connectivity to internet or PSN services. Each site has independent connectivity in addition to cross‑site connections. The failover decision will be dependent on the severity of the outage experienced; if outbound connectivity to the required networks is not available on the second site a failover event will not be initiated. Example scenarios and suitability for site failover The following are example Major Incidents that would trigger the question on whether to perform a failover. Incident Failover action Mitigation to minimise impact DDoS attack None Always-on hybrid DDoS solution Site fire/power outage Automatic or manual Secure site, fire suppression, standby generators, UPS, offsite backups Network connectivity between sites None Multiple DCI links - geographically diverse, multiple providers Compute: minor component failure Automatic Minimum of N+1 resilience, chassis and blades Compute: major component failure Automatic or manual Spare capacity/modular design/dual site Network hardware failure Automatic or manual Minimum of N+1 resilience, routers and switches Split site (OTV networking and management networking) Automatic or manual Multiple DCI links -- geographically diverse Failover timing The amount of time it takes for your services to failover will depend on the failure scenario, but generally the failover will take as long as the VM needs to reboot plus a small amount of additional time to invoke the failover - about 45 seconds. Some scenarios, such as a \"split brain\", can take longer, leading to an outage of two hours. Alerting and reporting A failover is a rare event and will normally be a result of a Major Incident. In these cases, we communicate to the wider community via the appropriate Portal and, if you have already reported an incident, via the ticket or by phone. You can also receive alerts via email subscription or using the Service Status page. We'll contact you after a failover to inform you that our actions are complete. We do not currently provide alerts when a VM is moved to a different site. However, you can check the location of your VMs. For more information, see How to use VM location in vCloud Director . Networking For internet‑bound traffic, we manage an autonomous Border Gate Protocol (BGP) service that enables us to intelligently redirect traffic without affecting your IP address allocation. The resilience of the external connectivity into the Elevated OFFICIAL security domain depends upon, and is generally provided by, the access network. Behind the router layer, we have designed a network that stretches between our two sites. This allows for network connectivity (if installed in one site) to remain if your virtual firewall and UKCloud's physical firewall are in separate and alternative sites. We advise that you consider how additional services such as Cloud Enablement and leased lines will be affected in a disaster recovery scenario, as this falls outside the Synchronous Protection offering. UKCloud's firewalls are protected within each site, with the failover between the sites performed via an orchestrated process. We achieve this through a sequence of routing changes within our network (see the figure below). Failover testing If you want to test your own service, you can test the Synchronous Protection failover function by requesting a Test Scenario. Test Scenarios are designed to test and understand how your applications might react in a failover when the underlying physical hosts have failed (simulated in the scenario) or when the VMs have been migrated in a live state. A Test Scenario is not a customisable feature of UKCloud for VMware. Test Scenario limitations UKCloud will complete a Test Scenario for a maximum of one VDC (up to 10 VMs). This provides you with an experience similar to a live failover scenario. Test Scenarios take place only during office hours (0900 - 1730). The failover will be deemed a success by UKCloud when we can identify that the VMs are running in the second UKCloud site, using our own monitors and tools. Backups cannot take place during a failover. We will not failover the connectivity and physical firewall during a Test Scenario. You will experience a network latency of a few milliseconds through this firewall. UKCloud do not, at present, offer a \"hard failover\" test where a physical host is switched off to simulate a hardware fail event. Test Scenario options Option 1. Dynamically moving your VMs between the two sites: We'll dynamically move your VMs between our sites while the VMs remain online. There will be increased network latency between client VMs that are running in the different sites (around 4 -- 4.5ms). Option 2. Restarting your VMs between sites: Your VMs can be shut down and restarted in the secondary site. If the shutdown is non-graceful (power‑off as opposed to a guest OS shutdown), this simulates the effect of a physical server outage from an individual VM perspective. This is the equivalent of a total site failure. As our platform is multi-tenanted, we will not replicate a physical host failure to invoke a disaster recovery scenario as this could affect other customers. The failover exercise will be conducted and failed back to the originating site during office hours (0900 - 1730). Failover testing outputs Failover test are generally seamless for customers, making it difficult for you to gauge that it has taken place. To provide assurance that the test was successful, we'll produce a report for each customer that identifies the following: A sanitised (removing ESX host names) report of the ESX servers that the VMs are located on during the period of the failover test Comments and observations Requesting a Test Scenario To request a Test Scenario, you need to raise a Service Request within the UKCloud Portal indicating that you want to complete the test and provide the following details: VDC name VM names (up to 10) you want to failover Start and end time Any other requirements Note that the start and end times must be within office hours, which are 0900 - 1730. When we receive the request, we'll respond either accepting or rejecting it. Note that we require a minimum of five working days notice prior to the request. If we accept your request, we'll schedule the work to start at the time you specified as long as it is within office hours (0900 - 1730). Failover testing charges We generally allow a test to be conducted during office hours (0900 - 1730) with a charge (based on the SFIA rate card - level 3 Apply). Longer testing periods will need to be approved by UKCloud. Feedback If you find an issue with this article, click Improve this Doc to suggest a change.

    "title": "Snapshot Protection Service Scope | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Snapshot Protection About this document This document explains what is and isn't included in the scope of the Snapshot Protection service option. Snapshot Protection is one of a variety of on‑platform protection options available from UKCloud. Use this service scope to understand Snapshot Protection and whether it will meet your own recovery point (RPO) or recovery time (RTO) objectives. About Snapshot Protection UKCloud offers a choice of snapshot options that operate as a daily backup service for customers using our VMware‑based compute services. You can choose from the following Snapshot Protection policies: 14‑day snapshot 28‑day snapshot When you opt a virtual machine (VM) into a Snapshot Protection policy, the VM is added to a daily automated snapshot. The snapshot is of the entire VM running on your UKCloud for VMware service. Data protected by the snapshot has an RPO of 24 hours. RTO is determined by the time taken to restore the VM after you've raised a service request. Snapshot Protection is chargeable based on the number of VMs protected and the capacity utilised to store the data. No protection products are automatically applied to VMs running on the UKCloud platform, therefore you must explicitly select the protection option that best meets your requirements. Frequency and timing Snapshots are scheduled to occur once in a 24-hour period. Snapshots take place 365 days of the year and are started inside the UKCloud‑defined window: 2000-0800. Snapshots are not started before 2000 or after 0800. We cannot guarantee the time at which your VM will have a snapshot taken inside this window; the time may also vary from day to day. The time of a snapshot is reported via the UKCloud Portal the next day. There's a system hard stop at 0900, at which time any active snapshots are cancelled. Success rate We do not guarantee successful snapshots. We can provide you with guidance on suitable candidates for Snapshot Protection (data change rate/size). VMs larger than 2TiB or with high change rates are not supported by Snapshot Protection, as the protection service will spend longer trying to establish what has changed and then attempt to back all of it up. Therefore, please contact your Technical Account Manager (TAM) if this scenario applies to one or more of your VMs. VM snapshots may be attempted more than once to obtain successful status. Only the final state will count in our calculations. Any snapshots still in progress at 0900 are considered as failed. Partial snapshots and those with errors count as failed. Reruns We may attempt to rerun a failed snapshot inside the window, depending on the failure code. We will not rerun snapshots outside the window. What SLA do you offer on snapshot success? Automated VM snapshots don't include an SLA. You should be aware that snapshots may occasionally fail for a variety of reasons. The status of automated VM snapshots is monitored continuously, and the UKCloud support team investigates all failures. It isn't always possible to rerun an automated VM snapshot, if this service doesn't meet your own protection requirements, we can also offer Journaling Protection options. If none of these services meet your requirements, you can also implement and manage your own protection solution. The UKCloud Cloud Storage platform may be an appropriate target for self‑managed solutions using software such as CommVault and NetWorker. Other The service is not backed by service credits. On occasion, planned maintenance will take precedence over VM snapshots. If there's a potential disruption, we'll highlight this to you via the service status page and UKCloud Portal notifications system. Snapshot management You can make changes to your Snapshot Protection via the UKCloud Portal. You can: Opt VMs into Snapshot Protection Change the Snapshot Protection policy for a VM Opt VMs out of Snapshot Protection Set a default Snapshot Protection policy for a VDC Alerting and reporting Information about your backups is reported on the UKCloud Portal. Reports are updated daily and are available by 1000, but typically within minutes of the close of the backup window. Reports are available covering every day of the retention period (14 or 28 days as appropriate). Alerting on individual VMs is not provided. Restores Timing and process You can ask to restore a VM via a service request, which is subject to standard support SLA timescales. Restores are performed outside of the backup window, unless a P1 incident is involved. You can find a definition of our support processes and severity categorisation in How to raise and escalate incidents and service requests . What you get We'll instantiate a new VM. This will incur additional storage charges. However, we can also restore over the existing VM if desired. We'll provide an image from a successful snapshot of your choice from within the policy length (that is, the last 14 or 28 days). You'll need to make any necessary switchover/networking changes. Fair use policy You can request up to four restores per month. If you request more than this, we will suggest a cloud architect investigate. The total number of VMs (or disks) in a restore request should not exceed five. KPIs We'll proactively investigate failures on the platform on the following triggers: Individual customer VM: Two successive snapshot window failures A failure of three snapshots in 14 days Platform: More than 50 missed VMs (VMs that should be in policy, but have not been backed up) Less than 99% success rate for VM snapshot Feedback If you find an issue with this article, click Improve this Doc to suggest a change.

    "keywords": "Managing your UKCloud for VMware environment using the UKCloud Portal API With the development of the UKCloud for VMware service for G‑Cloud 8, we've introduced some changes to the architecture underpinning the platform. The change in architecture introduces the concept of sites, regions and zones to enable you to design resilience into your solutions in a way that works best for you. Sites will be a familiar concept if you're already on the UKCloud platform. We have two sites, one in Corsham and one in Farnborough, creating the ability to deploy disaster‑resilient solutions across two geographically disparate locations. Regions are a new concept in UKCloud for VMware. Within each site we have independent regions, enabling you to create resilient solutions within a single site, allowing for protection such as synchronous replication between applications or databases. A region is made up of zones . A zone typically relates to a single service, and there is usually only one service zone per region. However, in the case of UKCloud for VMware, there may be multiple UKCloud for VMware zones in a single region, enabling you to build up services that are underpinned by different compute and storage but the same network. For more information, see Understanding sites, regions and zones . When managing the platform through the Portal API, if you've designed your solution across multiple regions, you must use different credentials for each environment that you're managing. Also, because each region has its own management instance, you must use the API endpoints that apply specifically to the region. This is important to remember so that you call the correct endpoints if your solution is deployed across multiple regions. You can find out which endpoints to use by clicking your username in the top right corner of the UKCloud Portal home page and selecting API: Using the API page to find the correct API URL for each region: Feedback If you find an issue with this article, click Improve this Doc to suggest a change.

    "title": "Understanding connectivity options in UKCloud for VMware | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Understanding connectivity options in UKCloud for VMware Introduction In UKCloud for VMware, UKCloud uses two different architecture designs. You can see this when you deploy virtual data centres (VDCs) onto our IaaS offering. Depending on the type of application you're running, you may see one or both types of network architecture when you deploy your solutions onto the UKCloud platform. This document explains what the different architectures look like so you can design your solutions to make the best use of them. Overview of UKCloud for VMware network architecture Our UKCloud for VMware service uses multiple security domains (Assured, Elevated and the Cross Domain Security Zone), enabling you to provide a service over the internet, government community networks (such as N3, PSN or JANET) or your own HybridConnect lines. Each of these networks brings its own challenges for network separation and prevention of accidental bridging. Our network architecture offers two different options to address these challenges. Your Cloud Architect will be able to advise you which solution works best for your application. Network Firewall Tenant (NFT) - NFTs are either single- or multi tenant instances on Network Firewalls (NFWs), depending on the network that the VDC is connected to. NFWs share an external network connectivity layer connected to the government community network. NFT architecture is used in regions 1, 2, 7 and 8. Cloud Fabric and gateway - There are no NFTs on shared firewalls, instead we use a shared Cloud Fabric and the separation of connection types is done at the edge level. Cloud Fabric and gateway architecture is used in regions 5 and 6. NFT network architecture With our NFT network architecture, we use a slightly different design, depending on the network you are connecting to. If you've already used UKCloud IaaS then you'll probably already be familiar with the way the NFT architecture presents itself. Single network architecture (internet) All VDCs on the Assured platform have outbound connectivity to the internet. When connecting a VDC to the internet (and no other network), we use the architecture shown the diagram below. You can see that Customer 1 has two VDCs, each of which has its own edge connected to the same NFT. Customer 1 and Customer 2 have separate NFTs on the same multi‑tenant NFW, which is on the shared internet facing network. From a customer management experience, you manage all your connectivity rules, such as firewall, IPsec VPN and NAT functionality, through your edge, using either the UKCloud Portal GUI or API. We manage the NFW and provide additional controls around whitelisted ports, metering and packet shaping. Multiple network architecture (PSN Assured and N3) If you want to add other networks to your VDC (for example, the health and social care network (N3) or PSN Assured), you can enable these connections through the same edge as your internet connection. This is possible because the separation of connectivity happens at the NFT. The NFT resides on a single tenant NFW to comply with the security requirements of these networks. In the diagram above, you can see that Customer 3 uses the same edge to connect to both the internet and the N3 network through an NFT on a single tenant NFW. Customer 4 uses a similar architecture to connect to the internet and PSN Assured. Management-wise, you can see the external IP range on the edge. Typically, you use this range for internet connectivity. However, in the case of PSN Assured and N3, we translate the address on the NFW before routing it to the edge. You won't see your PSN Assured or N3 address in your IP allocation, but your users will need to target the address to reach your service. PSN Assured If you're adding PSN Assured connectivity to a VDC, we translate each PSN Assured IP address to one of your external IP allocations, consuming one of your internet IPs. N3 If you're adding N3 connectivity to a VDC, we translate the N3 IP to one of the following: One of your external IP allocations, consuming an internet IP. A private address of your choice, bypassing the edge and enabling you to route the traffic directly to a virtual machine (VM) with the same private address. This retains your external IP allocation but limits the use of your N3 IP address. Multiple network architecture (Janet) If you want to connect to the Janet network, the network architecture is slightly different to that of other government community networks. As Janet is a new network in the UKCloud portfolio, we're able to leverage the changes to network connectivity in UKCloud for VMware. This means we can utilise the Cloud Fabric and Gateway model to present the Janet connection. In the diagram above, you can see two edges on the VDC: one presents the internet connectivity, and the other presents the Janet connectivity. The Janet-facing edge connects into the Janet Cloud Fabric and then out to the Janet network via the UKCloud managed gateway. The Janet facing edge has the same functionality as the internet facing edge and you can see your Janet IP address in the IP allocations on the edge. You manage the internet facing and Janet facing edges separately through the UKCloud Portal GUI or API. Networking in the Elevated platform Networking in the Elevated platform is very similar to the Assured platform. All connectivity is routed through the same edge on the VDC, and separation of connections occurs within the NFT. PSN Protected In the diagram above, Customer 1's PSN Protected connection is routed to their NFT sitting in the multi-tenant NFW. This then provides the onward connection to Customer 1's edge. The same NFT also handles the connections in from Cross Domain Security Zone products (Walled Garden, UKCloud Guard and SRA). It's worth noting that UKCloud translates the PSN Protected IP address to one of the external IP ranges that are available on the edge. Your users will target the PSN Protected IP address, however you'll see only your UKCloud allocated external range on your edge, so it's important to know what your PSN Protected IP has been translated to. RLI The RLI is also available in the Elevated platform, however it is not natively connected to the UKCloud platform. This means that, to facilitate a connection to the RLI, you must go through the assurance process provided by the MOD to gain access to the RLI; only then can we complete the connection between the RLI and your VDC. The NFT for RLI sits in a single tenant NFW in line with MOD connection compliance. Networking between VDCs You have three options when networking between VDCs. Each option has a slightly different use case. Option 1: Shared networks Shared networks are useful when you have multiple VDCs within the same organisation boundary (sometimes referred to as a vOrg). You can create networks that span VDCs, enabling VMs within different VDCs to communicate with each other. This is particularly useful if you have VDCs with VMs that are operating at different service levels (ESSENTIAL, POWER and PRIORITY) and need to have inter-VM communication. Option 2: IPsec VPN If you need VDC communication between VDCs that reside either in different regions, vOrgs or even in external data centres then you should use IPsec VPN tunnels. You can configure these on the edges of the VDCs that you are connecting. It's worth noting that you should configure the IPsec tunnels using your external IP address allocation, in both the Assured and Elevated platforms. In the Assured platform, each IPsec tunnel consumes an external (internet) IP. Option 3: Static routes Use static routes as an alternative to a shared network where you want more control of traffic between VMs if the VDCs you're connecting reside on the same NFT. As traffic must traverse the edge, you can put in extra rules around connectivity to lock down communication between VMs in different VDCs. This enables you to construct DMZs or separate out services to different users while continuing to communicate between your VMs. Bringing your own firewall In most circumstances, the UKCloud provided edge will work for your solution. However, if your solution requires next generation firewall functionality, such as malware detection, antivirus protection, URL filtering or complex load balancing, you can provide your own firewall solution. Note that if you choose to bring your own firewall, you're completely responsible for the deployment, configuration and management of that firewall. If you plan to deploy a firewall into a new VDC, let us know and we'll provision you a VDC with a dedicated network for you to deploy your firewall onto. If you change from a UKCloud‑provided firewall to your own firewall, we'll redeploy your firewall on to a dedicated network and you'll need to migrate your environment to that network. IP address allocations When you create a new vOrg, we'll provide you with a number of usable IP addresses per project, depending on the network you are connecting to: Internet - 5 x usable IPs N3 - 1 x usable IP PSN Assured - 1 x usable IP Janet - 1 x usable IP PSN Protected - 1 x usable IP You can request additional IP addresses as required via a Service Request. If you ask for a large number of IP addresses in a single request, we may ask you to provide further information to support your request. Cloud Fabric and gateway architecture The Cloud Fabric architecture utilises multi-tenant networks connected to UKCloud-managed gateways that provide external network connectivity to internet and government networks. The customer-managed edges are connected to the multi-tenant network and enable you to control firewall settings such as NAT, VPN and load balancing. There are no NFTs in the Cloud Fabric architecture so all the firewall settings are controlled by the edge VM. Single network architecture The diagram below shows how VDCs connected to a single network look using our new Cloud Fabric and gateway architecture. You can see that there is no NFT layer; instead each customer VDC has a edge that is connected directly into the multi‑tenant Cloud Fabric. This is then connected to a UKCloud‑managed gateway with onward connection to the internet. From a customer management experience, you manage all your connectivity rules, such as firewall, IPsec VPN and NAT functionality through your edge, using either the UKCloud Portal GUI or API. UKCloud controls the gateway out to the internet and provides metering and packet shaping, however you are in full control of ports. Multiple network architecture Most differences between NFT and Cloud Fabric can be seen with multiple network architectures. To achieve network separation and ensure security and compliance with government community networks, we've developed a new VDC edge architecture. In the diagram above, you can see that if you want to add other networks to your VDC (for example, N3, PSN Assured or Janet), you need separate edges to facilitate that connection. These edges have the same style of connectivity as the internet facing edge: an edge that connects into a Cloud Fabric, dedicated to that particular network, which then has onward connectivity to the government community network through the UKCloud‑managed gateway. Customer management is on a per-edge basis. You'll see multiple edges within your UKCloud Portal GUI and you'll need to manage these individually. The full functionality of each edge is available for every network connectivity, however UKCloud manages the port whitelist for all government connected networks. Network architecture for the Elevated platform Networking in the Elevated platform is the same as the Assured platform from a management perspective. Just like the Assured platform, there is edge separation for the different networks that feed into the Elevated platform. As the diagram above shows, the edge is connected to a Cloud Fabric with nward connectivity to the PSN Protected network. There is also an internal Cloud Fabric that connects the Elevated VDC to the Walled Garden, enabling cross-security domain communication. Networking between VDCs You have two options for communicating between VDCs. Both these options will be familiar if you already use our platform, but if you're used to using static routes, you'll need to use one of the two options below instead for all inter-VDC communication. Option 1: Shared networks Shared networks are useful when you have multiple VDCs within the same vOrg and region. You can create networks that span between VDCs, enabling VMs within different VDCs to communicate. This is particularly useful if you have VDCs with VMs that are operating at different service levels (ESSENTIAL, POWER and PRIORITY) and need to have inter-VM communication. Option 2: IPsec VPN If you need VDC communication between VDCs that reside either in different regions, vOrgs or even in external data centres then you should use IPsec VPN tunnels. You can configure these on the edges of the VDCs that you are connecting. It's worth noting that you should configure the IPsec tunnels using your external IP address allocation, in both the Assured and Elevated platforms. In the Assured platform, each IPsec tunnel consumes an external (internet) IP. In the Elevated platform each IPsec tunnel consumes either: An external (UKCloud) IP, if the tunnel is configured between VDCs An external (PSN Protected) IP, if the tunnel is configured between a VDC and an endpoint on the PSN Protected network Bringing your own firewall In most circumstances, the UKCloud‑provided edge will work for your solution. However, if your solution requires next generation firewall functionality, such as malware detection, antivirus protection, URL filtering or complex load balancing, you can provide your own firewall solution. Note that if you choose to bring your own firewall, you're completely responsible for the deployment, configuration and management of that firewall. If you plan to deploy a firewall into a new VDC, let us know and we'll provision you a VDC with a dedicated network for you to deploy your firewall onto. If you change from a UKCloud‑provided firewall to your own firewall, we'll redeploy your firewall on to a dedicated network and you'll need to migrate your environment to that network. IP address allocation The number of public IP addresses we provide depends on whether you are using a UKCloud‑provided firewall or bringing your own: UKCloud provided firewall - If you're using a UKCloud‑provided firewall, we'll allocate you a single usable IP per VDC edge. You can request additional IP addresses as required via a Service Request. If you ask for a large number of IP addresses in a single request, we may ask you to provide further information to support your request. BYOF - If you're using your own firewall technology, when you provision your VDC, we initially allocate you five public IP addresses. After this initial allocation, you can request more IP addresses by opening a Service Request. Maintaining compliance with multiple networks When connecting to the different UKCloud networks it's important to ensure that you uphold network connection compliance. To this end, the way you access the different government community networks has not changed in Enterprise Cloud Compute. In the Assured platform, you'll always have an internet connected edge. Access to other networks is as follows: For N3 you'll need to go through the UKCloud aggregation process For PSN Assured you'll need to get accreditation for the service you wish to provide from the PSN Authority For Janet you'll need to engage with your Cloud Architect In the Elevated platform: For PSN Protected you'll need to gain approval from the PSN Authority For RLI you'll need to get approval from the MOD For Cross Domain Security Zone services (Walled Garden, UKCloud Guard or SRA) you'll need to get the authorisation from your end-customer IA as well as the UKCloud SIRO The application processes haven't changed for any of these services, however it's important to be mindful about how you may have to design your architecture based on the network architecture you'll be deployed on. As an example, when connecting to the N3 network, you'll need to ensure that the N3 and internet networks aren't bridged. With the Cloud Fabric architecture and NFT architecture (shown in the two diagrams below respectively), you should ensure that VMs are not connected to both the internet and to N3 at the same time.

    "title": "Comparison of UKCloud for VMware against hyperscalers | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Comparison of UKCloud for VMware against hyperscalers Overview UKCloud has long been known for its VMware powered cloud that has enabled hundreds of UK public sector workloads to be moved to the cloud. Since the launch of this service, we've made significant investments and numerous innovations in the physical infrastructure, software implementation and the manner in which VMware is utilised. The service that's available today has been vastly improved in terms of reliability, functionality and performance. Although there are several cloud providers available to the UK public sector, UKCloud maintains its position as the number one choice for security-assured, citizen-facing services with UK data centres and UK-based security cleared staff. There are several factors to consider when choosing a cloud provider, such as price, performance, reliability, suitability for workloads, sovereignty and assurance. Value for money will often be at the forefront of the decision-making process. However, at UKCloud we are competitive on more than just price and believe performance is an important metric to consider. This article concentrates on performance benchmarking and introduces a comparison of performance on our VMware platform against other public cloud providers. Why does performance matter? These results are important for several reasons: Cost control – The superior performance of the UKCloud platform means that you can do more with less. To match our performance using the public cloud providers, you would need bigger instances, more instances or both – significantly increasing the cost of those platforms. A platform that appears 20% cheaper but has half the performance may mean you end up paying 60% more for the same performance. Business productivity – UKCloud for VMware has been designed specifically for customers transitioning their legacy workloads to the cloud. The majority of legacy applications are running in virtualised environments using VMware and hence can be moved quickly, with less risk, and yet immediately benefit from the elasticity and scalability of the cloud. Superior performance means that you can achieve greater operational efficiency on our platform. User experience – As digital systems are increasingly used by millions of users (for example, citizens), it's important that your platform can deliver superior performance when your users need it. Our approach to benchmarking To validate the performance of our platform, UKCloud has been running automated tests to compare the performance of UKCloud for VMware against two leading proprietary public cloud platforms: Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. The benchmarking was based on the PerfKit Benchmarker tool which was originally developed by Google and made available to the open source community. PerfKit is designed to provide a repeatable, consistent and open way of measuring cloud performance. PerfKit was configured to specifically compare UKCloud for VMware in Region 6, Zone F with AWS EU-West 2 (London) region and the Azure London region. The benchmarks ran throughout August 2017 and average values for the month are reported below. UKCloud have worked on extending Perfkit to directly support vCloud Director based clouds, this is available from the UKCloud Github pages and will be contributed back to the core repository. This will enable you to run your own benchmarks with up-to-date data, allowing for a ready comparison of our performance against other public cloud providers. You will also be able to compare performance from a set time period of your choice. Benchmark results UKCloud performed a suite of tests to assess the performance of various components of the platform, as well as some end-to-end system tests. The rest of this article provides more detail regarding each of the benchmark results. Note For the graphs shown in this article, a higher result indicates superior performance (UKCloud outperforms AWS on 80% of the benchmarks performed and Azure on 100%). Networking performance The networking performance test is a commonly used benchmark that can create TCP and UDP data streams and measure the throughput of a network that is carrying them. The values shown in the graph below indicate the maximum throughput of the respective networks. UKCloud has a maximum throughput almost 4 times higher than that of AWS and over 6 times higher than Azure. This is important for customers who are moving large sets of data or need quick access to their data over the network. This results in less time spent waiting for data transfers to be completed, which allows applications to access their data more quickly, meaning applications are able to run faster, giving a better user experience. MongoDB (NoSQL) overall performance* MongoDB is an open-source database developed by MongoDB, Inc. Unlike relational databases, it stores data in JSON format that can vary in structure. This data model gives you the ability to represent hierarchical relationships and other complex structures easily. MongoDB was designed with high availability and scalability and therefore includes out-of-the-box replication and auto-scaling. The performance of MongoDB running on UKCloud for VMware is almost 2 times faster than both AWS and Azure meaning that MongoDB performs almost twice as many operations per second on the UKCloud platform. This results in better database performance and means there is higher data availability to applications, which in turn affects the service that a customer consumes, resulting in a better customer experience. * Test performed with 32 threads and a combination of operation types. Redis Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure used as a database, cache and message broker. Supported data structures include strings, hashes, lists, sets, stored sets, bitmaps, hyperloglogs and geospatial indexes. The outstanding performance of Redis is achieved through an in-memory dataset. Depending on what you use RDB (Redis) for, you can benefit from on-disk persistence by dumping the dataset to disk or appending each command to a log. RDB (Redis) running on UKCloud is 2 times faster than AWS and almost 2 times faster than Azure, meaning that Redis can perform twice as many requests per second on our platform. This results in better caching and message throughput which means that smaller clusters of data are required for the same workload. This also means that fewer VMs are required for the workload, therefore saving the user money. Random IO performance Random read is a measure of how quickly multiple small files can be read from random areas on a disk. Random read performance is measured in input-output operations per second with the number shown below an indication of the maximum number of reads. Random write uses the same disk pattern as random read but data is written to the disk rather than read. The graph below shows that the UKCloud platform performs 2.5 times faster random read IOPs than AWS and over 15 times faster than Azure. For random write, the UKCloud platform performs 9 times more IOPs than AWS and almost 61 times more than Azure. This means that enterprise applications such as relational databases which are disk-intensive (require high I/O), perform better on the UKCloud platform. Databases and applications that are disk intensive are often slowed down by their storage, hence the increased popularity of Solid State Drives (SSD). However, as the graph below shows, UKCloud provides fast storage access allowing applications to rapidly access and process data, resulting in faster applications compared to AWS and Azure’s equivalent storage option. Sequential IO performance (IOPS) Sequential read is a disk access pattern where large continuous blocks of data are read from adjacent locations on the disk. Sequential write is the same pattern, but data is written to the disk rather than read. These kinds of disk access patterns are common when accessing large multimedia files such as music, video and images. They are also important for data warehouses and analytics applications. The graph below shows that for sequential read the UKCloud platform performs 8 times better than AWS and almost 4 times better than Azure. For sequential write, the UKCloud platform has a maximum IO over 3 times higher than AWS and 2 times higher than Azure. As with databases, these kinds of applications are often slowed down by their storage, hence the increased popularity of solid state drives (SSD). However, as the graph below shows, UKCloud provides fast storage access allowing applications to rapidly access and process data, resulting in faster applications compared to AWS and Azure's equivalent storage option. High sequential IO performance is vital for data analysis and specifically for data warehouses which are a core component of business intelligence and thus guide key management decisions. Where does UKCloud for VMware outperform public cloud providers? These results show that UKCloud for VMware consistently outperforms both AWS and Azure across a variety of benchmarks; (UKCloud outperforms AWS on 80% of the benchmarks performed and Azure on 100%). Networking performance Almost 4 times higher than AWS Over 6 times higher than Azure Users spend less time transferring data on the network, allowing applications to access their data faster and thus running faster also MongoDB performance 2 times faster than AWS and Azure Better database performance allows for higher data availability to applications, therefore resulting in a better customer experience Redis performance 2 times faster than AWS Almost 2 times faster than Azure Smaller clusters of data are required for the same workload – this means fewer VMs are required and therefore saves you money Random I/O performance Random Read is 2.5 times faster than AWS and over 15 times faster than Azure Random Write is 9 times faster than AWS and almost 61 times faster than Azure Faster storage access allows applications to rapidly access and process data and thus results in faster applications Sequential I/O performance Sequential Read is 8 times better than AWS and almost 4 times better than Azure Sequential Write is over 3 times higher than AWS and 2 times higher than Azure High sequential IO performance is vital for data analysis and specifically for data warehouses, it is a core component of business intelligence and thus guides key management decisions Summary The data summarised in this article demonstrates that UKCloud not only competes with leading public cloud providers on price but also offers superior performance on our VMware platform. Using UKCloud for VMware means that you can do more for less as you can save money with simple usage-based billing and benefit from the greater performance the platform offers. Although a platform may appear cheaper, if it has half the performance this may mean you could end up paying significantly more for the same performance. Although actual performance may vary based upon numerous real-world factors such as internet latency, application-tuning and a low risk of multi-tenant contention, we are confident that these benchmark results truly reflect the greater performance that UKCloud for VMware delivers over the nearest equivalent region and VM sizes of both AWS and Azure. We are continuously investigating ways to improve the performance of our VMware cloud through using the latest versions of VMware, software-defined storage and networking, coupled with adaptive storage and network tuning as the platform is consumed. All of this will reassure our customers that the greater performance delivered today, will remain in the future.

A good use case for this example would be if a customer was utilising like for like copies of production for pre-production environments. In order to do the cloning efficiently a PowerCLI script is required. This article will guide you through the scripts required to automate the process of cloning, as well as removing this once a vApp is no longer required. The PowerCLI scripts can be plugged into various different configuration like tools such as Puppet or Chef and can also be integrated into orchestration tools such as Jenkins. Script to clone vApps You can find an example of the PowerCLI script to clone and remove a vApp on UKCloud's GitHub repository: https://github.com/ukcloud/knowledge_centre/tree/master/CloningvAPPsUsingPowerCLI The example script clones the specified vApp into an existing catalogue within the appropriate vDC. The script provides an option for deployment once it has been cloned. If you select this option, the vApp is deployed by the script. Stop and remove vApp using PowerCLI When a vApp has been used and is no longer required, there is a remove PowerCLI script that provides an automated way of removing the cloned environment. This script stops the vAPP and then deletes it from the catalogue specified. The scripts are executed using VMware vSphere PowerCLI.

    "keywords": "How to create an isolated VDC network Overview An organisation virtual data centre network enables its virtual machines (VMs) to communicate with each other or to provide access to external networks. A single VDC can have multiple networks. There are two network flavours, isolated and routed: An isolated (internally connected) network is one that only VMs within the VDC can connect to. This guide describes how to create an isolated VDC network. A routed network (externally connected) provides access to machines and networks outside the VDC via the edge gateway. You can have up to nine usable routed networks per VDC. Creation of routed networks is described in How to create a routed VDC network . The steps for creating an isolated VDC network depend on the version of vCloud Director available in your environment: vCloud Director 8.20 vCloud Director 9.1 Creating an isolated VDC network (vCloud Director 8.20) In vCloud Director, click the Administration tab. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware Double-click the virtual data centre (VDC) that you want to work with, or right-click the VDC and select Open . Select the Org VDC Networks tab. Click the green + icon (or right-click an empty row and select Add Network ). Select the option to Create an isolated network . Click Next . In the Configure Network page, create a network Gateway address and Network mask , and add a DNS if possible. The Static IP pool is similar to DHCP in the sense that it's a range of IP addresses to be consumed by the VMs connecting to the network. When a VM is configured it will have a static manual or a static IP pool address assigned to it. For static manual, enter the address manually. This must be a valid address for the pool. The VM will keep this address for as long as it exists. For static IP pool, enter a range of addresses. A free address from the IP pool will be allocated to the machine automatically. As an example, if you give the gateway address as 192.168.1.1 , you may then want to give a static IP pool of 192.168.1.10 to 192.168.1.100 . This will give you a pool of 91 IP addresses to assign to machines within your network. You can always increase this later if needed. Click Next . Give the network a Name and Description . If you want to make the network shareable with other VDCs, select the Share this network check box. Click Next to review your settings, and then click Finish .You'll then need to create a network gateway address and network mask. Creating an isolated VDC network (vCloud Director 9.1) In the vCloud Director Virtual Datacenters dashboard, select the VDC in which you want to create the network. In the left navigation panel, select Networks . Click the Add button. In the Add Org VDC Network dialog box, from the Type radio buttons, select Isolated network within this Virtual Data Center . Confirm that you're creating the network in the correct Org VDC . Enter a Name and Description for the network. If you want to make the network shareable with other VDCs, select the Share this network with other VDCs in this organization check box. Create a network Gateway address and Network mask , and add a DNS if possible.

Give the rule a name and assign a source IP address and source port type. This can be any port or a specific port number. Add a destination IP address and port, then choose which protocol to assign to the rule. Select whether to make the rule an Allow or Deny rule, and whether to log the network traffic for this particular rule. (Log viewing is currently not available owing to the multi-tenant nature of the environment. We are working to make this feature available in the future.) Note With firewall rules, you are allowing packets through from the external network to the public IP address which is subsequently NAT-ed. A common mistake is to create firewall rules from external to an internal Org Network IP address or range. When you're finished, click OK . Example A common use case for a firewall rule is to allow SSH through from the internet. The following example uses allocated public IP addresses. When your VDC is provisioned in the: Assured OFFICIAL platform, you're assigned five public IP addresses Elevated OFFICIAL platform, you're assigned three PSN-P IP addresses In the examples below, the source is any (any IP address within the VDC). The source port is also any . The destination is a public IP address and the destination port is 443 for HTTPS.

These addresses are injected into virtual machines (VMs) via VMware Tools during Guest Customisation. They appear in the usual places in Windows and Linux where you would interrogate IP settings, and show as static addresses. In some situations, you may require true DHCP functionality in your VMs, so that IP addresses are shown as dynamically defined. As with an IP pool, you're defining a non-overlapping range of IP addresses to use on the network. The steps for creating a DHCP pool vary depending on what type of edge gateway you're working with: Creating a DHCP pool for an advanced gateway Creating a DHCP pool for a standard edge Note We recommend that you convert your edge to an advanced gateway to access the latest vCloud Director functionality.

    "keywords": "Understanding High Performance Compute Overview The scale and elasticity of cloud makes it an ideal environment for large-scale compute-intensive workloads such as Grid Engines, High Performance/Throughput Compute (HPC/HTC) and Massively Parallel Processing (MPP), all of which have an enduring requirement for large amounts of processor cores and memory. UKCloud's High Performance Compute service is designed for these types of workloads. In return for a volume and term commitment for a large number of compute cores, customers get a cost-effective, highly scalable infrastructure. High Performance Compute leverages the benefits of the UKCloud assured cloud platform, providing you with a trusted cloud platform that's connected to key government networks, such as HSCN for health and social care, and Janet for research and education. For workloads that require a temporary, more flexible or dynamic service, UKCloud's UKCloud for VMware may be more suitable. It offers exceptional performance and scalability, and consumption-based pricing. We also offer UKCloud for OpenStack, so we can deliver a suite of services to meet all of your needs. Key benefits High Performance Compute: Uses a proven hyperscale architecture to deliver predictable performance at scale Is optimised for the sensitivity of your specific workload via the DDoS-protected internet-facing Assured security domain and the trusted Elevated domain Offers a choice of virtual machine (VM) sizes to suit the core and memory density requirements of your compute-intensive workload Is tuned to reflect the inherent resilience provided by your Grid Engine solution Meaning that you can: Deploy compute-intensive workloads on a massively scalable and inexpensive platform Avoid the CAPEX costs, risk and complexity associated with deploying a private infrastructure Build hybrid cloud solutions optimised for both compute-intensive workloads or more traditional workloads Integrate compute-intensive workloads with systems and datasets located on secure government networks (such as HSCN, Janet and PSN) High Performance Compute features We understand that long-term compute-intensive workloads require a platform that is suitably scaled, has no resource contention, offers flexible core-to-memory ratios, and is delivered at an appropriate per-core-hour price point. UKCloud's High Performance Compute is designed to meet these requirements, and to provide an easy-to-deploy and easy-to-use infrastructure that can power your Grid Engine or parallel processing workloads. The service is provided with a variety of cluster-wide options as follows: Choice of our security domains. We provide both an internet-connected Assured OFFICIAL domain and Elevated OFFICIAL domain, which is primarily connected to government secure networks. Choice of network connections. This includes PSN (including legacy networks such as GSI, PNN, CJX), RLI, HSCN and Janet. Virtual CPU mode option. High Performance Compute is based on hyper-threaded cores which provide a cost-effective solution for compute-intensive workloads. You can opt for Native mode by using up to half the allocated cores to ensure a one-to-one mapping between virtual CPUs and physical (non hyper-threaded) cores for maximum processing power. Choice of core-to-memory ratio. All VMs in your compute-intensive cluster must be identically configured based on one of two core-to-memory ratios. High Performance Compute includes as standard: Virtual firewall One production virtual data centre (VDC) and one non-production VDC VMware High Availability (HA) protection (only with persistent storage) Basic load balancing DDoS-protected internet Personalised support via Customer Success Managers, Technical Account Managers and a telephone support desk To model a total cost of ownership, you may also want to consider additional elements, such as connectivity, and service options, such as cloud enablement and cross-domain services. High Performance Compute is subject to the following: The minimum cluster size is 1,920 cores, which can be scaled in blocks of 960 cores. All VMs within the cluster must exist within a single production VDC and within a single site. All VMs within the cluster must be identically configured and programmatically deployed with appropriate workload distribution such as a grid engine. This is because the SLA does not apply to availability of individual VMs. If using Tier 0 storage is configured with two local disks in a RAID 10 configuration. All available storage in the cluster will be allocated to the customer with a 6-month minimum commitment. If any VMs are deployed with MS Windows Server OS, all provisioned cores must be licensed and will be charged at the current rate (as shown in the Pricing Guide). There is a two-year (24-month) fixed-term commitment, which can be continued via a further 24-month call-off contract subject to the standard procedures. Committed Compute Spend is calculated as the effective hourly cost multiplied by the number of hours in a two-year period (for example 24 x 365 x 2 = 17,520). 50% of the Committed Compute Spend must be paid upfront; the remaining 50% will be invoiced equally over 24 months. Early Termination Fee: if the contract is terminated before month 24, the customer will be liable for the remaining cost of the Committed Compute Spend In addition to the Committed Compute Spend, a final balancing payment equivalent to 20% of the Committed Compute Spend will be due at month 24 of the contract. The final balancing payment will not apply in the event that the customer enters into a further two-year (24-month) fixed-term commitment.

    "keywords": "Cloud GPU Service Scope About this document This document describes the boundaries of the Cloud GPU service, along with the division of responsibilities between you and UKCloud, to facilitate the provisioning and ongoing use of the service. About Cloud GPU Cloud GPU enables you to supplement your on-platform compute resources with GPU capabilities. Utilise the UKCloud for VMware platform with Cloud GPU to meet the specialist requirements of some advanced applications, with the benefits of a cloud environment. It supports the following types of workloads: Visualisation workloads. Traditional use cases for GPU processing such as simulations, powering desktop applications with graphics content (for example computer aided design), video encoding, rendering or streaming. Visualisation is currently not suitable for virtual reality (VR) workloads. Compute workloads. GPUs have become prevalent in a world that needs a lot of data processing, fast. The parallel nature of GPU cores lends themselves perfectly to support compute-intensive initiatives such as deep learning and large-scale mathematical modelling. Service architecture Cloud GPU is an add-on service for UKCloud for VMware. A GPU product must be purchased in conjunction with UKCloud for VMware and be attached to a PRIORITY VM within a GPU-enabled region. GPU resource can be assigned to a VM in two ways, depending on the type of GPU acceleration needed. Visualisation workloads can be carried out using our NVIDIA M60 GPUs. These are presented to the VM as a profile of a certain size. There are multiple profiles of different sizes that can be associated with a VM Compute workloads can be carried out using our NVIDIA P100 GPUs. These are currently presented to a VM on a per-card basis, enabling the VM to have access to the full resource of a card. Currently only two cards can be associated with a single VM. Visualisation GPUs are mapped to a VM through NVIDIA GRID, and the GRID licence is included in the GPU price. Visualisation GPUs use a GRID Q profile. Compute GPUs use a GRID B profile, which can be changed to a Q profile by a Service Request. Service options A Cloud GPU-enabled VM must reside within a PRIORITY VDC within a UKCloud for VMware region that is GPU enabled. Workload type Resource allocation Automated Rebalancing PRIORITY Uncontended (CPU/GiB) Configured to reduce workload movement around the platform, reducing workload disruption To have GPU enabled in your environment, you will need to raise a Service Request . When you raise a service request, you will need to specify the profile that you want to be made available from the following options: Workload type Presentation Memory size Visualisation Profile (slice of card) 1GB 2GB 4GB 8GB Compute Card 16GB Storage Storage can be provisioned to the GPU-enabled VM. This is done independently from GPU provisioning and is within the customers control. For more information, see the UKCloud for VMware Service Scope . Protection Snapshots for GPU-enabled VMs are currently not available, but you can use Zerto to protect GPU-enabled VMs. You can find more information about protection options in the UKCloud for VMware Service Scope . Service availability The Service Level Agreement for Cloud GPU is 99.90%. Unavailability applies to the inability to connect to a new GPU resource in the event of a failure of a GPU service within a single zone. Failure condition is following a hardware fault recognised at the Infrastructure layer or below, and within UKCloud-controlled components. The SLA of 99.90% supersedes any other SLA relating to the VM that the GPU is associated with. Emergency and planned maintenance is excluded from calculations. You are entitled to claim Service Credits for outages to services where the SLA falls below 99.90%. For more about how we calculate SLAs, see the SLA Definition . Service background The following applies to the Cloud GPU service GPU-enabled VM templates control the allocation of GPU resources. Visualisation GPU profiles are fully provisioned - you will get 100% of GPU profile resource allocation. Compute GPUs are fully provisioned - you will get 100% of GPU resource allocation. We actively capacity-manage the cloud platform to ensure you have access to the GPU resources you request. You can specify Farnborough or Corsham as the site where you would like to have your Cloud GPU service provisioned. We will try to accommodate requests and will advise you if we are unable do so. We control the deployed versions of GPU technology on the platform. This covers internal platform-supporting technologies, and any technology versions available to you. This includes, but isn't limited to, the NVIDIA GRID and the NVIDIA hardware version of the GPU service. You can make additional configurations inside a GPU-enabled VM, such as implementing third-party software technologies. Customer implementations inside a VM are solely the responsibility of the customer including any patches or updates. Service resilience You should be aware that the disruptive nature of GPU hardware failures means that in the event of a GPU hardware failure, the GPU-enabled VM will fail. In this event, UKCloud will be responsible for connecting the VM to another available GPU inside the zone. If there are no GPU hosts available inside a zone for connection to, an SLA event will be triggered. Additionally, you should also be aware that VMs using the Cloud GPU solution will have on-platform resilience tools (such as vMotion and HA on VMware) disabled. This maintains the connection to the GPU, but reduces the automatic recovery of those VMs in the event of a failure. Platform monitoring As well as monitoring the components that underpin the UKCloud for VMware aspect of the Cloud GPU service, UKCloud also monitor the GPU hardware health and will proactively manage the physical aspects of the GPU to ensure service availability. UKCloud reserve the right to proactively move a GPU-enabled VM to another GPU-enabled host if we believe a critical component failure is imminent. This action is covered by the GPU SLA. Operating systems Licencing. We provide the GRID licence which is included within the GPU price. UKCloud can also provide Operating Systems (OS) licensing, and is mandatory with respect to Windows Server. For more information, see the UKCloud for VMware Service Definition Assured | Elevated . VM server images. We provide base GPU-enabled VM images for the OS for which we provide licensing. You can access these from vCloud Director once the GPU-enabled image has been made available to you. Update services. We make update repositories available for all software for which we provide licensing. We don't provide software update facilities for non-UKCloud licensed software. Anti-virus. We do not provide anti-virus software as part of the service. Networks All networks available to the UKCloud for VMware platform are available for GPU-enabled VMs. A full overview of the connectivity options and network architecture is available in Understanding connectivity options in UKCloud for VMware . Protective monitoring We have implemented GPG 13-aligned Protective Monitoring across the Assured and Elevated platforms at the hypervisor level and below. We do not provide Protective Monitoring services above the hypervisor (for example, for your VM) - it is your responsibility to monitor at this level. In line with UKCloud's SISP, we provide notification of customer-impacting security incidents. It is your responsibility to report similar incidents to us. Platform management You can access, manage and view the GPU-connected VMs in the same way that you would manage the rest of your UKCloud for VMware service. Access only those features allowed by their role, in any of the following ways: vCloud Director API. Enables the programmatic creation and management of GPU-enabled VMs inside the platform. vCloud Director Graphical User Interface. Provides a graphical interface to access the vCloud Director environment (depending on assigned permissions) and manage GPU-enabled VMs. UKCloud Portal. Enables the creation of compute services and subsequently, PRIORITY VDCs and the requesting of GPU resources for environments. The Portal also includes an overview of actual and estimated spend, along with service configuration information. Access to service reporting and incident and request management is also possible through the UKCloud Portal. You cannot access the underlying infrastructure. This includes (but isn't limited to) the GPU hardware and the GPU management plane. Service reporting Visibility. We provide a monthly service report via the UKCloud Portal. This includes a summary of platform availability, including GPU resource availability, and a retrospective of the interactions with UKCloud support during the previous month. Maintenance notifications and Service Status reports are also delivered through the Portal. Service reporting. All service reporting is done via the UKCloud Portal. Billing. We provide you with monthly invoices and detailed CSV reports covering your previous monthly spend. Your GPU-enabled machines will be within the reports, and a separate column will provide you with information regarding your GPU usage. Customer service Customer Success Manager (CSM). For the first 90 days of the service, you have access to a UKCloud CSM. They will help you with your adoption of the UKCloud Cloud GPU service, including finding relevant systems and using UKCloud tools and processes. Cloud Architects. UKCloud Cloud Architects support you during the design of solutions for the cloud platform. They are ideally placed to help reconcile your requirements with the UKCloud platform. We recommend engagement with a Cloud Architect when implementing complex solutions, such as those using HybridConnect or a Walled Garden. Technical Account Managers (TAM). After the initial 90 days, you'll be allocated with an assigned point of contact who will provide ongoing assistance with reporting and incident escalation. Support. After the initial on-boarding and design phase, you can utilise the standard UKCloud support entitlement, which is outlined in the Cloud GPU Service Definition Assured | Elevated . Customer responsibilities Alongside the responsibilities outlined in the UKCloud for VMware Service Scope , you are responsible for assessing whether the UKCloud GPU service can support the various requirements of your application. Service provisioning Outside of the creation of your UKCloud for VMware resources needed to support your GPU service, customers can request the addition of GPU capabilities in GPU-enabled zones via the service request option, and the service will be available within 10 working days. If you request access to Cloud GPU resources for existing VMs that are not in a GPU-enabled zone, our CSMs will work with you to configure new UKCloud for VMware, High Performance Compute or UKCloud for OpenStack services in the correct zone. UKCloud has created several videos, helpful guides, manuals and FAQs to help train and instruct users so that they are up and running quickly and easily. These are available within the Knowledge Centre . As previously mentioned, you will be assigned a Customer Success Manager (CSM) to provide any assistance required during the first 90 days of the service. UKCloud also has a large ecosystem of partners who can deliver additional services, such as support and professional services. UKCloud would be pleased to introduce you to the right partner to suit your needs. Service constraints UKCloud will adhere to the following in terms of maintenance windows: \"Planned Maintenance\" means any pre-planned disruptive maintenance to any of the infrastructure relating to the service. Planned Maintenance activity may result in periods of degradation or loss of availability depending on the nature of the activity required. In such cases, UKCloud shall provide you with at least fourteen (14) days' advance notice of the Planned Maintenance if you will be affected. If during Planned Maintenance there is a loss of availability outside the scope described in the planned maintenance notification to the service, an SLA event will be triggered. This time will be excluded from the availability calculation but will be included in monthly service reporting related to the service. \"Emergency Maintenance\" means any urgent maintenance required to prevent or mitigate against any event compromising the infrastructure relating to the service. Whenever possible, UKCloud shall: a) provide affected customers with at least six (6) hours' advance notice and b) carry out the emergency maintenance between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Friday or between the hours of Saturday 00:00 to 06:00 (UK local time) on Monday, (including bank holidays) unless there is an identified and demonstrable immediate risk to customer environment(s). Emergency Maintenance may result in periods of degradation or loss of availability depending on the nature of the activity required. If during Emergency Maintenance there is a loss of availability to the service, an SLA event will be triggered. This time will be excluded from the availability calculation but will be included in monthly service reporting related to the service. You should be aware of some of the limitations of parts of the SLA. The disruptive nature of GPU hardware failures means that in the event of a GPU hardware failure, the VM will also fail. In this event, UKCloud will be responsible for connecting the VM to another available GPU inside the zone. If there are no GPU hosts available inside a zone for connection to, an SLA event will be triggered. You should be aware that by adding a Cloud GPU to a VM, the SLA for the core compute service is replaced for that VM.

    "title": "Cloud GPU FAQs | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Cloud GPU FAQs General What is Cloud GPU? Cloud GPU is a supplementary Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) option that enables customers to meet the specialist compute requirements of certain advanced applications. This falls into two categories: Visualisation workloads - taking advantage of the traditional use of GPU for powerful desktop/server applications which use graphically intensive content, such as computer-aided design (CAD), simulations and video encoding, rendering or streaming. Computational workloads - The parallel nature of general purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) cores enables initiatives such as deep learning, analytics and large-scale mathematical modelling. What can the service help you achieve? Cloud GPU enables UKCloud customers to supplement their cloud compute resources with GPU capabilities: Improve the speed at which you can gain insight into your data. Cloud GPU’s massively parallelised capabilities enable you to process large data sets at a much faster rate, allowing for greater operational efficiency. Bring GPU-reliant applications to the cloud. Applications that have previously struggled to transition to the cloud because of GPU requirements can now be moved — improving manageability of your data and applications, while increasing collaboration opportunities. Improve access to your most important applications. Cloud GPU lets you centralise your applications so that staff can access the tools they need, from anywhere, on commodity devices. Streamline compute resources. Offload processing power to GPUs, reducing the CPU footprint needed to run applications. What technology does Cloud GPU use? The service is provisioned using NVIDIA cards in the required hosts. Different cards are utilised depending on the use case: Visualisation - NVIDIA M60 cards with GRID are designed to share virtual GPUs across multiple virtual desktop and application instances Computational (GPGPU) - NVIDIA Tesla P100 cards are designed to accelerate the compute-intensive elements of applications. How does Cloud GPU work? Cloud GPU utilises NVIDIA's GRID engine to expose GPU resources to client virtual machines (VMs). The GPU card is exposed as a shared PCI device which can then be used by the customer's VM. Are there any prerequisites? Yes. To take advantage of the Cloud GPU service, you must also have UKCloud for VMware VMs running on the UKCloud platform. These VMs must be running in a 'Priority' virtual data centre as the GPU mapping requires 100% memory allocation to the VM. Further to this, VMs wishing to utilise GPGPUs (NVIDIA Tesla P100) must be built from specific GPGPU enabled templates providing specific BIOS settings. Does UKCloud require specific NVIDIA driver versions? Yes. VMs utilising the NVIDIA GRID solution must use the GRID driver matching the driver installed on the vSphere hosts (currently 385.41). This driver can be downloaded from the UKCloud Knowledge Centre . Which compute services support Cloud GPU? Currently, Cloud GPU only supports environments provisioned on UKCloud for VMware in regions 5 and 6. There are future plans to enable the service on UKCloud for OpenStack and High Performance Compute. How is it billed? Cloud GPU is billed per card per hour for GPGPU, and per vGPU per hour for visualisation. Please note that this is in addition to the UKCloud for VMware VM charge. You have the option to power off Cloud GPU when not required to avoid unnecessary costs. All usage is billed and invoiced at the end of each month. Where can I find more information on NVIDIA GRID? The full NVIDIA GRID documentation is available on the NVIDIA website here . Where can I find more information on NVIDIA CUDA? You can find the latest information regarding CUDA on the NVIDIA website here . What is the SLA? The SLA for Cloud GPU is 99.90%. You can find full details regarding the SLA in SLA definition . What happens if the card fails? If a card failure occurs, our support team will identify the issue and re-instantiate your service on another GPU-enabled host. Can I have multiple GPUs associated with a single VM? Yes. Can the GPU service be added to one of our existing servers or would it require a new server? If you are using the GPU for Visualisation then yes, it could be added to an existing server, if the VM is in a GPU-enabled region. If your existing VM is not in the correct region then we would need to move it to a new server before enabling GPU for Visualisation on it. If you are planning on using GPU for Compute then you would need a new VM as a different BIOS is required. Feedback If you find an issue with this article, click Improve this Doc to suggest a change.

    "title": "How the UKCloud OpenStack platform outperforms hyperscalers | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How the UKCloud OpenStack platform outperforms hyperscalers The evolution of UKCloud UKCloud has long been known for its VMware powered UKCloud for VMware service, which has enabled hundreds of UK Public Sector workloads to be moved to the cloud. In response to increasing demand from customers creating genuine cloud native (12-Factor) applications, we have developed and launched our UKCloud for OpenStack service, powered by OpenStack – the leading open-source alternative to the proprietary global public cloud platforms. The OpenStack service that is available today has been vastly improved in terms of reliability, functionality and performance. Although there are several cloud providers available to the UK Public Sector, UKCloud maintains its position as the number one choice for security assured citizen-facing services with UK data centres and UK-based security cleared staff. There are several factors to consider when choosing a cloud provider, such as price, performance, reliability, suitability for workloads, sovereignty and assurance. Value for money will often be at the forefront of the decision-making process. However, at UKCloud we are competitive on more than just price and believe performance is an important metric to consider. This document will concentrate on performance benchmarking and introduces a comparison of performance on our OpenStack platform against other public cloud providers. Based on our innovative, next generation infrastructure Our OpenStack platform is deployed on our innovative, next generation infrastructure. Rather than a SAN-based converged infrastructure, our next generation infrastructure is built on commodity hardware and leverages software defined data centre (SDDC) technology including software defined networking (Cisco ACI and OpenStack Neutron) and software defined storage (Red Hat Ceph). This new infrastructure is designed to deliver much greater levels of scalability via multiple fault domains to improve availability and resilience. As bottlenecks such as the storage array and network functions are replaced with highly distributed resources, the new infrastructure is designed to deliver much greater levels of performance compared with our previous infrastructure. Why does performance matter? These results are important for several reasons: Cost control – the superior performance of the UKCloud platform means that you can do more with less. To match our performance using the public cloud providers, you would need bigger instances, more instances or both – significantly increasing the cost of those platforms. A platform that appears 20% cheaper but has half the performance may mean you end up paying 60% more for the same performance. Developer productivity – our OpenStack platform has been designed specifically for agile software development projects where there is a real demand for environments to be provisioned rapidly and destroyed when no longer needed. Superior performance means that pipeline automation happens quickly and reliably so your developers aren't blocked waiting for the infrastructure to be ready. User experience – as digital systems are increasingly used directly by millions of potential users (for example, citizens), it's important that your platform can deliver superior performance when your users need it. Our approach to benchmarking To validate the performance of our platform, UKCloud has been running automated tests to compare the performance of UKCloud for OpenStack against two leading proprietary public cloud platforms, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. The benchmarking was based on the PerfKit Benchmarker tool which was originally developed by Google and made available to the open-source community. PerfKit is designed to provide a repeatable, consistent and open way of measuring cloud performance. PerfKit was configured to specifically compare the UKCloud Region 5, Zone C UKCloud for OpenStack platform with AWS EU-West 2 (London) region and the Azure London region. The benchmarks ran throughout August 2017 and average values for the month are reported below. Benchmark results UKCloud performed a suite of tests to assess the performance of various components of the platform, as well as some end-to-end system tests. The following pages provide more detail regarding each of the benchmark results. Note For the graphs shown in this document, apart from instance boot time where a lower result is better, a higher result indicates superior performance. (UKCloud outperforms both AWS and Azure on 90% of benchmarks performed). Instance boot time Instance boot time refers to the amount of time taken for an instance to boot from a powered off state. The graph below shows that UKCloud instances on the UKCloud for OpenStack platform boot 1.5 times faster than AWS and almost 7 times faster than Azure. This means that you will benefit from reduced delay in loading the instances and the end user is able to quickly access the applications within them. MongoDB MongoDB is an open-source database developed by MongoDB, Inc. Unlike relational databases, it stores data in JSON format that can vary in structure. This data model gives you the ability to represent hierarchical relationships and other complex structures easily. MongoDB was designed with high availability and scalability and therefore includes out-of-the-box replication and auto-scaling. The performance of MongoDB running on the UKCloud for OpenStack platform is 2 times faster than AWS and almost 2 times faster than Azure meaning that MongoDB performs over twice as many operations per second on the UKCloud platform. This results in better database performance with UKCloud and means there is higher data availability to applications, which in turn affects the service that a customer consumes, resulting in a better customer experience. Network performance The networking performance test is a commonly used benchmark that can create TCP and UDP data streams and measures the throughput of a network that is carrying them. The values shown in the graph below indicate the maximum throughput of the respective networks. UKCloud has a maximum throughput almost 12 times higher than AWS and almost 19 times higher than Azure. This is important for customers who are moving large sets of data or need quick access to their data over the network. This results in less time spent waiting for data transfers to be completed, which allows applications to access their data more quickly. Ultimately meaning applications can run faster, giving a better user experience. Random IO performance Random read is a measure of how quickly multiple small files can be read from random areas on a disk. Random read performance is measured in input-output operations per second with the number shown below an indication of the maximum number of reads. Random write uses the same disk pattern as random read but data is written to the disk rather than read. The graph below shows that the UKCloud for OpenStack platform performs over 5 times more random read IOPs than AWS and over 34 times more than Azure. For random write, the UKCloud platform performs over 4 times more IOPs than AWS and over 27 times more than Azure. This means that enterprise applications such as relational databases which are disk-intensive (require high I/O), perform better on the UKCloud platform. Databases and applications that are disk intensive are often slowed down by their storage, hence the increased popularity of Solid State Drives (SSD). However, as the graph below shows, UKCloud provides fast storage access allowing applications to rapidly access and process data, resulting in faster applications compared to AWS and Azure's equivalent storage option. Sequential IO performance Sequential read is a disk access pattern in which large continuous blocks of data are read from adjacent locations on the disk. Sequential write is the same pattern, but data is written to the disk rather than read. These kinds of disk access patterns are common when accessing large multimedia files such as music, video and images. They are also important for data warehouses and analytical applications. The graph below shows that for sequential read the UKCloud platform performs almost 11 times better than AWS and over 5 times better than Azure. For sequential write, the UKCloud platform has a maximum IO over 10 times higher than AWS and over 6 times higher than Azure. As with databases, these kinds of applications are often slowed down by their storage, hence the increased popularity of Solid State Drives (SSD). However, as the graph below shows, UKCloud provides fast storage access allowing applications to rapidly access and process data, resulting in faster applications compared to AWS and Azure's equivalent storage option. High sequential IO performance is vital for data analysis and specifically for data warehouses which are a core component of business intelligence and thus guide key management decisions. Where does the UKCloud OpenStack platform outperform both hyperscalers? The data in the benchmark results section shows that the UKCloud for OpenStack platform consistently outperforms both hyperscalers across a variety of benchmarks including: Instance Boot Time 1.5 times faster than AWS Almost 7 times faster than Azure Reduced delay in loading the instances means that users are able to readily access the applications within them Networking Performance Almost 12 times higher than AWS Almost 19 times higher than Azure Users spend less time transferring data on the network, allowing applications to access their data faster and thus running faster MongoDB 2 times faster than AWS Almost 2 times faster than Azure Better database performance allows for higher data availability to applications, therefore resulting in a better customer experience Random I/O Performance Random Read is over 5 times faster than AWS and over 34 times faster than Azure Random Write is over 4 times faster than AWS and over 27 times faster than Azure Faster storage access allows applications to rapidly access and process data and thus results in faster applications Sequential I/O Performance Sequential Read is almost 11 times better than AWS and over 4 times better than Azure Sequential Write is over 10 times higher than AWS and over 6 times higher than Azure High sequential IO performance is vital for data analysis and specifically for data warehouses, it is a core component of business intelligence and thus guides key management decisions Summary Although a platform may appear cheaper, if it has half the performance this may mean you could end up paying significantly more for the same performance. Using UKCloud's OpenStack platform means that you can do ‘more for less’ as you can save money with simple usage-based billing and benefit from the greater performance the platform offers. While actual performance may vary based upon numerous real-world factors such as internet latency, application-tuning and a minimal risk of multi-tenant contention, we are confident that these benchmark results truly reflect the greater performance that UKCloud for OpenStack delivers over the nearest equivalent region and VM sizes of both AWS and Azure We are continuously investigating ways to improve the performance of our UKCloud for OpenStack platform through using the latest versions of OpenStack, software-defined storage and networking, coupled with adaptive storage and network tuning as the platform is consumed. All of this will reassure our customers that the greater performance delivered today, will remain in the future.

    "title": "OpenStack live migrations | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "OpenStack live migrations Overview OpenStack utilises virtualisation technology where several virtual instances (sometimes also known as virtual machines or VMs) run on physical servers. These physical servers run software that enables them to be hypervisors, allowing them to run many virtual servers. For a more detailed description of virtualisation, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization . Many other resources exist on the internet explaining the concept of virtualisation. Planning maintenance activity When performing maintenance activity on a hypervisor server, it's best practice to migrate all the instances running on that server to another one so the activities on the server being worked on don't affect those instances. After this migration process, the instances that were running on the original hypervisor server will now be running on a different server. Within each OpenStack region on the UKCloud platform, we have several hypervisor servers providing the UKCloud for OpenStack service. The process of live migration moves a running instance seamlessly from one hypervisor server to another, meaning that the instances can continue running without any interruption to service. When all the instances have been moved onto different hypervisor servers, then maintenance can take place on the original hypervisor server safely (including reboot of the physical server, and so on). The act of performing the live migration may slow down an instance's performance during the period when it is being migrated due to the need to copy the data on the instance to another hypervisor server. In some types of virtualisation environment, and depending on configurations, it's possible for instances to migrate themselves to other servers, but in OpenStack this has to be done manually by an administrator (UKCloud employee) in the region.

    "keywords": "How to deploy multiple VMs from a vApp template simultaneously using the API If you intend to deploy multiple VMs simultaneously from a single vApp template, you'll need to raise a request through the UKCloud Portal requesting that Change Block Tracking (CBT) is disabled on your template. Alternatively, if your VMs are in the ESSENTIAL service level then these will not be backed up meaning CBT will not be enabled. The following options are available to ensure reliable simultaneous deployment: Inform us of a newly created vApp template. If we're informed on the day of creation, we can disable CBT for the vApp template allowing you to start deploying from template right away. If we're not informed on the day, our automatic backup script will run overnight and the template will be added to our backup software with the default Enable CBT option enabled. We will then have to disable this to undo any changes it made to the VM overnight before any simultaneous deployment can occur. Use the ESSENTIAL service level, which does not provide any backup functionality. This means that CBT will never get enabled on any of the vApp templates (useful for mass deployment of vApp templates).

    "keywords": "How to create a static route Overview Static routing allows you to configure your edge gateway to indicate to other networks how to get to further networks. It's particularly useful if you need to route between virtual data centres (VDCs) in the same vOrg. Static routing is the only option in vCloud Director; routing protocol cannot be used. As an example, you may have a vApp network 192.168.8.0/24 routed to a VDC network called Front end network . You could create a static route to enable traffic to get to the outside IP of the vApp edge at 192.168.4.33 (a NAT will exist there). The steps for creating a static route vary depending on what type of edge gateway you're working with: Creating a static route for an advanced gateway Creating a static route for a standard edge Note We recommend that you convert your edge to an advanced gateway to access the latest vCloud Director functionality. For more information, see How to convert your edge to an advanced gateway . Creating a static route for an advanced gateway To create a static route on your advanced gateway: In vCloud Director, access the edge gateway settings. For more detailed instructions, see How to access edge gateway settings Select the Routing tab. On the Static Routes tab, click the + button. In the Add Static Route dialog box, fill in the details of the network range, next hop (edge IP) and select the network interface to which you want to apply the static route. When you're done, click Keep then click Save changes . Repeat the steps for the second VDC. Creating a static route for a standard edge Note You can only manage advanced gateways in the new vCloud Director 9.1 tenant portal. If you're working with a standard edge gateway, you must first switch to the vCloud Director web console to manage the edge.

    "keywords": "UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone application process Overview The UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone (CDSZ) enables you to securely transfer data between our Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL security domains using NCSC-approved cross-domain security patterns. Using the CDSZ you can create applications that are accessible to citizens, but ensure data safety. This document provides an overview of the UKCloud process to be used by customers wanting to purchase CDSZ services (UKCloud Guard, Walled Garden and Secure Remote Access). There are two approaches to applying for CDSZ services: A light touch design review/self-assessment route for customers with simple implementations, or those who are experienced at designing secure solutions. This enables customers who are comfortable with the risk associated with their data to choose which controls and evidence they feel is appropriate to self-certify their cross domain solution. An assurance wrap style approach with UKCloud’s experienced professionals for more complex implementations or those customers who would like support and guidance when developing their solutions. This enables customers who require more support to submit their proposed solution with confidence that it effectively mitigates against risk. In this document, the customer is the UKCloud customer, who may or may not be the ultimate end user of the application. The customer will be responsible for completing any compliance process with the end user, including obtaining sign-off from the relevant data owner. The data owner should be a permanent employee at the data owning organisation with evidence of data ownership, for example an IT Security Officer (ITSO), Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO) or accreditor. The data owner can choose to sign off for a single CDSZ implementation or setup a Tell Us Once agreement that signs off all future CDSZ implementations for the customer on behalf of the data owning organisation. UKCloud will maintain a list of all Tell Us Once agreements and any subsequent CDSZ applications by the customer on behalf of the data owner should reference this agreement. Process overview The following table provides more detail about each stage: Stage Name Description 1 Initial Contact Customer contacts UKCloud to register interest in CDSZ service. This can be through My Calls or direct contact with a Sales representative, Technical Account Manager (TAM) or Cloud Architect. 2a Self-Assessment Customer creates document pack to illustrate the solution design and provide evidence that all necessary sign-offs and compliance have been obtained. 2b Assurance Wrap Review Customer creates document pack with assistance from the UKCloud compliance team and Cloud Architect. 3 Design Review Customer presents the technical solution to Cloud Architect for advice and feedback. 4 Application Submission Customer raises a Service Request and submits document pack. 5 Service Implementation UKCloud provisions service and customer implements their solution. 6 On-Going Compliance UKCloud annually prompts customer to review existing document pack and provide updated information for any changes to design or approvals. Required documents When you apply for a CDSZ service, you must provide the following documents to show that you have identified and mitigated for any risks: Details of your proposed implementation that covers the intended design in the CDSZ, the Assured and Elevated VDCs you are connecting to and data flows. Evidence (for example, email or signed document) of acceptance of risk from the data owning organisation. This should also indicate if this acceptance is a Tell Us Once agreement that will also apply to future CDSZ implementations by the customer on behalf of the data owner. Note If a Tell Us Once agreement is already in place between the customer and the data owner, this evidence is not required, but the customer should indicate that such an agreement is in place so that UKCloud can confirm against our list of trusted partners for the data owner. An explicit statement, as part of the Service Request, that the solution has been reviewed by a named UKCloud Cloud Architect or that you do not require a review. The named Cloud Architect must provide review notes as evidence that the review took place. See Stage 3: Design review . If you're connecting to a PSN Protected enabled VDC, proof of PSN compliance (a copy of PSN CoCo or PSN CoP). Stage 1: Initial contact If you want to use the CDSZ, you can initiate the application process in one of two ways: Raise a Service Request through My Calls, specifying the relevant CDSZ product (UKCloud Guard, Walled Garden or Secure Remote Access). One of our Sales representatives, TAMs, or Cloud Architects will arrange a call to discuss your requirements and then close the Service Request. Contact one of our Sales representatives, TAMs, or Cloud Architects directly to arrange a call to discuss your requirements. During your initial conversation, our Cloud Architect will discuss your proposed implementation and help determine the best approach for your situation: If your implementation is simple, or you're confident with designing a solution that mitigates the risk associated with your data and choosing the controls and evidence appropriate to that solution, you can follow our self-assessment option. If your implementation is complex, or you'd prefer some guidance to identify risks and how to mitigate against them, we can provide an assurance wrap style approach with our experienced professionals for more complex implementations. The following table lists some examples of simple versus complex designs: Criteria Simple Complex Business case Common use cases, aligned with Government Digital Strategy. Use cases where no precedent has been established. Multi-tenant solutions. Technical architecture Standard architecture compliant with NCSC design patterns or UKCloud published blueprints. Deviations from established models or blueprints. Non-fully virtualised solutions, for example with elements of hosting within our Cloud Enablement service. Risk ownership Clear accreditation by a single recognised SIRO within a UK public sector organisation. Shared accreditation. Accreditation by private sector authority. Stage 2a: Self-assessment If you choose to self-assess your implementation, you must gather all the documents listed in Required Documents. With self-assessment, you can still request a design review from one of our Cloud Architects. See Stage 3: Design review . Stage 2b: Assurance wrap review If you choose an assurance wrap review for your proposed implementation, the UKCloud compliance team and Cloud Architects will work with you to help identify risks to your solution. This includes: Review of design and data flow with a Cloud Architect (see Stage 3: Design review ) Advice and guidance for how to design secure solutions with appropriate monitoring and logging Conversation between UKCloud SIRO and customer SIRO or nominated representative covering risk management and mitigation, with further workshops if required Review of customer-defined ITHC scope and summary with a Cloud Architect Note UKCloud takes no ownership or responsibility for the implementation or running of your proposed solution or ownership for any risks to the data. Note UKCloud reserves the right to charge SFIA day rate charges for time spent on customer projects if you disengage with the assurance wrap review process before completion. At the end of the review period, you will have generated all the necessary documents to apply for your CDSZ service (as listed in Required documents ). Stage 3: Design review The design review is facilitated by a Cloud Architect and will gather a clearer understanding of how the proposed design aligns with recognised good security practice. Present your technical solution to a Cloud Architect. You can do this via teleconference, Webex or face-to-face as appropriate. The Cloud Architect will be looking to see evidence of effective mitigation for common risks (for example, technical controls like firewall, anti-malware and protective monitoring). The Cloud Architect will provide advice and guidance on aspects of the solution that are likely to raise concerns. You may revise your design to incorporate feedback from the design review. Note If you are self-assessing your proposed implementation, this stage is optional but you must provide a statement in your document pack indicating that you do not require a review. Stage 4: Application submission Raise a Service Request specifying the relevant CDSZ product (UKCloud Guard, Walled Garden or Secure Remote Access) and attach all the required documents , as well as any review notes from the assurance wrap review. This request will then be assigned to a UKCloud representative to verify that all required information has been provided. If any documents are missing or empty, a UKCloud representative will contact you to ensure that all required documents are provided before the service is provisioned. Stage 5: Service implementation When the assigned UKCloud representative has determined that all the appropriate information has been provided, the requested CDSZ service will be provisioned within five working days. When your service has been provisioned, you can implement your proposed solution. Stage 6: On-going compliance On an annual basis, UKCloud requires evidence of on-going compliance. You will be contacted by your Technical Account Manager (TAM) to review the existing documents and inform us if any of the details or approvals have changed. If you're connecting to a PSN Protected enabled VDC, proof of PSN compliance (a copy of PSN CoCo or PSN CoP) must be provided on a yearly basis. Once the relevant PSN certificate (if required) is provided, and provided there are no changes the original design, your CDSZ service will continue without interruption. If, after examination of the existing documents, you identify that there have been changes, for example if the design has changed from the initial solution or there is a different data owner approver, it is your responsibility to submit a revised evidence pack within 15 days. A UKCloud representative will contact you to discuss your changes. Feedback If you find an issue with this article, click Improve this Doc to suggest a change.

    "title": "How to configure an L2 VPN | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to configure an L2 VPN Overview UKCloud for VMware provides Layer 2 (L2) VPN functionality as part of its Enterprise Networking Bundle (additional charges apply). With L2 VPN you can stretch the same Layer 2 broadcast domain over an SSL tunnel across two edge gateways in different sites, meaning that you can move your workloads seamlessly between sites without having to change IP addresses. L2 VPN is an extension of the edge's SSL functionality. It enables you to configure a tunnel between two sites, extending a logical switch across both sites. The tunnel means that virtual machines (VMs) remain on the same subnet if they are moved between the two sites, enabling you to extend your data centre across multiple sites. An NSX edge at one site can provide all services to VMs on the other site. UKCloud L2 VPN functionality covers three scenarios: L2 connectivity between UKCloud regions Connectivity from your own on-premises site (with vSphere and NSX) to UKCloud L2 connectivity from any remote site (without vSphere and NSX) to UKCloud Before you begin Before enabling L2 VPN, consider the following: You must have purchased the Enterprise Networking Bundle for your UKCloud for VMware service You must have converted your edge gateway to an advanced gateway (see How to convert your edge to an advanced gateway ) This service takes up one of your allocated IP addresses (primary or secondary) L2 VPN can be enabled only on a routed Org VDC network You cannot use SSL VPN on any edge gateway running L2 VPN You may encounter issues with IPsec VPN You cannot use load balancers using HTTPS on primary or secondary edge gateway addresses once L2 VPN is enabled You'll need to change any existing NAT and firewall rules using the primary or secondary IP of the edge for HTTPS If your remote site does not have vSphere or NSX, you'll need to deploy a standalone edge as the L2 VPN client (see Deploying a standalone edge as an L2 VPN client ) Configuring L2 VPN To set up L2 VPN, you need to configure an L2 VPN server on the destination edge and an L2 VPN client on the source edge. You must then enable the L2 VPN service on both the server and the client. If one of the sites that you want to stretch is not backed by NSX, you can deploy a standalone edge as the L2 VPN client on that site (see Deploying a standalone edge as an L2 VPN client ). Setting up the network Create a routed VDC network on both the source and destination sites. For more detailed instructions, see How to create a routed VDC network . Note To stretch the subnet across the two sites, make sure you use the desired address space on both networks. For each network, select the network and click Convert To . Select Convert to Subinterface to connect the network as a subinterface to the trunk interface on the attached gateway, then click OK . To be able to move, your VMs need to be able to access your new network, so you need to attach them to it. Creating certificates In vCloud Director, access the edge gateway settings for the destination edge gateway. For more detailed instructions, see How to access edge gateway settings . Select the Certificates tab. Click + CA Certificate . Add the certificate to use for the L2 VPN server then click Keep . Repeat this process for the source edge gateway. Configuring the L2 VPN server on the destination edge gateway The L2 VPN server is the destination edge gateway to which the client is to be connected. In vCloud Director, access the edge gateway settings for the destination edge gateway. For more detailed instructions, see How to access edge gateway settings . Select the VPN tab, then the L2 VPN tab. For L2VPN Mode , select Server . On the Server Global tab, from the Listener IP list, select the primary or secondary IP address of an external interface of the NSX edge. In the Listener Port field, enter the port to use for your L2 VPN. The default port is 443 . Select the Encryption Algorithm to use for communication between the server and the client. In the Service Certificate Details section, click Change Server Certificate . Enable the Validate Server Certificate toggle, select the certificate you created earlier then click OK . Click Save changes . Select the Server Sites tab. Click the + button. In the Add Peer Site dialog box, specify details for the peer site to enable other sites to connect to the L2 VPN server, then click Keep . Click Save changes . Configuring the L2 VPN client on the source edge gateway The L2 VPN client is the source edge gateway that initiates communication with the destination edge (L2 VPN server). Note If the source site is not backed by NSX, you can deploy a standalone edge as the L2 VPN client. For information see Deploying a standalone edge as an L2 VPN client . In vCloud Director, access the edge gateway settings. For more detailed instructions, see How to access edge gateway settings . Select the VPN tab, then the L2 VPN tab. For L2VPN Mode , select Client . In the Server Address field, enter the address of the L2 VPN server that you set up in the previous section. The address can be the host name or IP address. In the Server Port field, enter the port to use for your L2 VPN. The default port is 443 . Select the Encryption Algorithm for communicating with the server. Click Select Sub-Interfaces and select the sub interfaces to be stretched to the server. In the Egress Optimization Gateway Address field, if the default gateway for VMs is the same across the two sites, enter the gateway IP addresses of the sub interfaces or the IP addresses to which traffic should not flow over the tunnel. In the User Details section, enter the user credentials to connect to the L2 VPN server. Click Save changes . Completing L2 VPN configuration Configure TCP optimisation. Configure firewall and NAT rules on both the destination and source edge gateways to allow traffic to pass between the L2 VPN server and the L2 VPN client. Enable L2 VPN on the destination edge gateway. In vCloud Director, access the edge gateway settings. For more detailed instructions, see How to access edge gateway settings . Select the VPN tab, then the L2 VPN tab. For L2VPN Mode , select Server . Enable the Enabled toggle. Click Save changes . Repeat the steps above to enable L2 VPN on the source edge gateway (setting L2VPN Mode to Client ). Deploying a standalone edge as an L2 VPN client If the source site is not backed by NSX, you can deploy a standalone edge as the L2 VPN client. Download NSX-l2vpn-client.ovf and deploy the standalone edge. For more information, see the following VMware article: Configure Standalone Edge as L2 VPN Client . Convert the edge gateway to an advanced gateway. For more information, see How to convert your edge to an advanced gateway . Create a port group and convert it to a sub interface. You can now set up your L2 VPN by following the steps below, using the standalone edge as the source edge gateway.

Configuring edge gateway IPsec VPN settings The steps for configuring edge gateway IPsec VPN settings vary depending on what type of edge gateway you're working with: Configuring edge gateway IPsec VPN settings for an advanced gateway Configuring edge gateway IPsec VPN settings for a standard edge Note We recommend that you convert your edge to an advanced gateway to access the latest vCloud Director functionality. For more information, see How to convert your edge to an advanced gateway . Configuring edge gateway IPsec VPN settings for an advanced gateway In vCloud Director, access the edge gateway settings. For more detailed instructions, see How to access edge gateway settings Select the VPN tab. Select the IPsec VPN tab. On the Activation Status tab, select the IPsec VPN Service Status toggle. Select the IPsec VPN Sites tab. Click the + icon. In the Add IPsec VPN dialog box, select the Enabled toggle. Complete the configuration as follows: Enable perfect forward secrecy (PFS) - Select this if your on-premises/remote site has that capability. Name Local Id Local Endpoint - The external IP of your edge gateway (refer to the first steps of this procedure for more information). Local Subnets - Enter the organisation networks that can access the VPN (separate multiple local subnets with commas). Peer Id Peer Endpoint - The external IP of your remote site or on-premises firewall or edge where VPN is being set up. Peer Subnets - This is the subnet on your on-premises network that you want to make accessible from your UKCloud VDC. For example, if your on-premises networks sit inside the 10.20.0.0/16 range, you could enter 10.20.0.0/16 here or limit your entry to a smaller subnet of that, for example 10.20.0.0/25 . Encryption Algorithm - Select the most secure protocol that is supported by your on-premises gateway. Authentication - Select the authentication method that is supported by your on-premises gateway. If you want to use certificates, then you need to configure those first on the Certificates tab. Pre-Shared Key - The shared secret used to authenticate and encrypt the connection. It must be an alphanumeric string between 32 and 128 characters that includes at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter and one number. This must be the same on both sites. Diffie-Hellmann Group - We recommend setting this to DH14 or higher if your on-premises environment can support it. When you're done, click Keep to create the edge end of the VPN tunnel then click Save changes . Configuring edge gateway IPsec VPN settings for a standard edge Note You can only manage advanced gateways in the new vCloud Director 9.1 tenant portal. If you're working with a standard edge gateway, you must first switch to the vCloud Director web console to manage the edge. For more information, see How to switch to the vCloud Director web console from the tenant portal . In vCloud Director, click the Administration tab. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware Double-click the virtual data centre (VDC) that you want to work with, or right-click the VDC and select Open . Select the Edge Gateways tab. Right-click the edge gateway and select Properties . In the Edge Gateway Properties dialog box, select the Configure IP Settings Make a note of the IP address in the IP Addresses column then click OK . You'll need to use this IP address later to use as your tunnel endpoint address. Right-click the edge gateway and select Edge Gateway Services . Select the VPN tab. Select the Enable VPN check box. Click Add . In the Add a Site-to-Site VPN configuration dialog box, complete the configuration as follows: Name Description Establish VPN to - Choose between: A remote network A network in this organisation A network in another organisation Local Networks - Choose the organisation networks that can access the VPN. If you have only one, select that. Peer Networks - This is the subnet on your on-premises network that you want to make accessible from your VDC. For example, if your on-premises networks sit inside the 10.20.0.0/16 range, you could enter 10.20.0.0/16 here, or limit your entry to a smaller subnet of that, for example 10.20.6.0/25 Local Endpoint - The external network of your Edge Gateway. Only one option should be available. Encryption protocol - Choose the most secure protocol that is supported by your on-premises gateway Shared Key - The shared secret to use to authenticate and encrypt the connection. It must be an alphanumeric string between 32 and 128 characters long and include at least one upper-case letter, one lower-case letter, and one number. MTU - Reduce from default to 1350 . When you're finished, click OK . Creating the second VPN gateway You now need to create the endpoint of the VPN tunnel. If this is a different VDC (in the Elevated security domain) or vOrg, go through the steps described above again to create the tunnel. When you've done that, you can change your firewall settings and validate the connection (see below). If you're connecting to an external data centre, you'll need to set up the tunnel on that premises. Creating an external data centre VPN gateway Although we can't provide specific instructions on setting up an external data centre gateway to connect to the edge gateway, we've provided information about some configuration requirements below. IKE Phase 1 and Phase 2 IKE is a standard method for arranging secure, authenticated communications. Phase 1 parameters Phase 1 sets up mutual authentication of the peers, negotiates cryptographic parameters, and creates session keys. The Phase 1 parameters used by an advanced gateway are: Main mode AES/AES256/AES-GCM (user configurable) Diffie-Hellman Group Pre-shared secret (user configurable) SA lifetime of 28800 seconds (eight hours) with no kbytes rekeying ISAKMP aggressive mode disabled The Phase 1 parameters used by a standard edge are: Main mode TripleDES / AES (user configurable) SHA-1 MODP group 2 (1024 bits) Pre-shared secret (user configurable) SA lifetime of 28800 seconds (eight hours) with no kbytes rekeying ISAKMP aggressive mode disabled Phase 2 parameters IKE Phase 2 negotiates an IPSec tunnel by creating keying material for the IPSec tunnel to use (either by using the IKE phase 1 keys as a base or by performing a new key exchange). The IKE Phase 2 parameters supported by an advanced gateway are: AES/AES256/AES-GCM (Will match the Phase 1 setting) ESP tunnel mode Diffie-Hellman Group Perfect forward secrecy for rekeying (only if it was turned on in both endpoints) SA lifetime of 3600 seconds (one hour) with no kbytes rekeying Selectors for all IP protocols, all ports, between the two networks, using IPv4 subnets The IKE Phase 2 parameters supported by a standard edge are: TripleDES / AES (will match the Phase 1 setting) SHA-1 ESP tunnel mode MODP group 2 (1024 bits) Perfect forward secrecy for rekeying SA lifetime of 3600 seconds (one hour) with no kbytes rekeying Selectors for all IP protocols, all ports, between the two networks, using IPv4 subnets Configuring the edge gateway firewall When the VPN tunnel is up and running, you'll need to create firewall rules on the edge gateway for any traffic passing over the tunnel. For how to do this, see How to create firewall rules . Key points to note: You need to create a firewall rule for both directions, that is, from data centre to VDC and from VDC to data centre. For data centre to VDC, set: Source as the source IP range for your external VDC/data centre network Destination as the destination IP range for your VDC network For VDC to data centre, set: Source as the source IP range for your VDC network Destination as the destination IP range for your data centre/VDC network Configuring the external data centre gateway firewall When the VPN tunnel is up and running, you may need to create firewall rules and routes on your on-premises gateway or other internal firewall for traffic passing over the tunnel. This is outside of the scope of this article and will depend on your specific premises network configuration. Validating the tunnel When you've configured both ends of the IPSec tunnel, the connection should start without any issues. To verify the tunnel status in vCloud Director: In vCloud Director, access the edge gateway settings. For more detailed instructions, see How to access edge gateway settings For advanced gateways: Select the Statistics tab and then the IPsec VPN tab. For each configured tunnel, if you can see a tick, the tunnel is up and running and operational. If any other status is shown, you'll need to review your configuration and any firewall rules. For standard edges: - Select the **VPN** tab. - For each configured tunnel you should see an entry in the **Status** column. If it's a green tick, the tunnel is up and operational. If any other status is shown, you'll need to review your configuration and any firewall rules. Note It can take up to two minutes after the tunnel is established to show that the VPN connection is active. You should now be able to send traffic via the VPN. Note Logs from the vCNS IPsec VPN cannot currently be used to aid fault finding. Next steps In this article you've learned how to configure IPsec VPN.

    "keywords": "How to configure a Distributed Logical Router Overview UKCloud for VMware provides Distributed Logical Router (DLR) functionality as part of its Advanced Networking bundles (additional charges apply). DLR optimises the routing of east-west traffic within your VDCs, using a hypervisor on the source VM to limit traffic flow to a maximum of two hosts (the source and a destination), without the need to route traffic back through the edge gateway. As well as providing much better performance, DLR can scale up to 1000 routed logical networks (rather than the 10 logical network limit imposed by traditional edge gateway routing). Before you begin Before enabling DLR, consider the following: You must have purchased either the Advanced Networking Bundle or Enterprise Networking Bundle for your UKCloud for VMware service You must have converted your edge gateway to an advanced gateway (see How to convert your edge to an advanced gateway ) Your advanced gateway must have one free interface for DLR to use for the transit (P2P) network IPv6 is not supported with DLR L2 VPN is not supported on a distributed VDC network vApp routed networks are not supported You can only have one DLR instance per VDC edge gateway You can create up to 1000 distributed networks per edge gateway You cannot distribute a VLAN-based network Your local subnets should not overlap with the transit network ( 10.255.255.248/30 ) You cannot modify the transit connection between the edge gateway and DLR You can change auto-generated DHCP and static route configurations on the edge gateway To disable DLR on the edge gateway, you must first remove all distributed networks You can migrate existing VDC networks to distributed network without service disruption You cannot run more than one routing protocol on each DLR (BGP or OSPF) If you use OSPF, you cannot run it on more than one DLR uplink Dynamic routing protocols are only supported on uplink interfaces Enabling distributed routing for Distributed Logical Router To enable distributed routing, you must use the vCloud Director Web Console. Log in to vCloud Director via the UKCloud Portal. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware . In the Virtual Datacenters dashboard, select your VDC. In the Virtual Machines tab, click See this page in the vCloud Director Web Console . Select the Administration tab. Double-click your VDC, then select the Edge Gateways tab. Right click the edge gateway for which you want to enable DLR and select Enable Distributed Routing . Click Yes to confirm your selection. Creating a distributed network After you've enabled distributed routing, you can create your distributed networks. You can create up to 1000 distributed networks per edge gateway. Tip The following steps show how to create a distributed network in the vCloud Director tenant portal. If you prefer to use the web console, see the steps for vCloud Director 8.20 in How to create a routed VDC network , making sure to select the Create as distributed interface check box.

    "title": "How to configure a Distributed Firewall | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to configure a Distributed Firewall Overview UKCloud for VMware provides Distributed Firewall (DFW) functionality as part of its Advanced Networking and Enterprise Networking bundles (additional charges apply). DFW enables microsegmentation of networks at the virtual data centre (VDC) level. It can inspect every packet and frame coming to and leaving the VM regardless of the network topology. Packet inspection is done at the VM virtual NIC (vNIC) level, which enables ACLs to be applied closest to the source. You can have a routed or isolated network on a vApp and still use a DFW at the VDC level to complement it. The NSX edge handles North-South bound traffic while the DFW is designed to manage East-West bound traffic. The DFW rules can be based on Layer 2 (L2) up to Layer 4 (L4). L2 rules (Ethernet tab) are based on MAC address L2 protocols like ARP, RARP and LLDP L3 rules (General tab) are based on Ip source destination L4 uses a TCP or UDP service port Layer 2 (Ethernet) firewall rules are processed before Layer 3 rules. The default firewall rule allows L2 and L3 traffic to pass through your VDCs. Once you have implemented all the rules, you can change this to block. Rules are always read and enforced from top-to-bottom ordering like any traditional firewall. DFW rules can have one or more of the following entities as the source or destination: Org VDC networks, virtual machines, Org VDCs, MAC sets (L2 – Ethernet), IP sets (L3 – General) or security groups. Note Running open VMare tools on VMs has not been validated with DFW. Configuring a Distributed Firewall To access the DFW: Log in to vCloud Director via the UKCloud Portal. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware . In the Virtual Datacenters dashboard, select the VDC that contains the DFW you want to manage. In the left navigation panel, click Security . Select the Security Services for your VDC, then click Configure Services . Even though other VDC security policies are listed in this section, you cannot launch the configuration until you switch to the relevant VDC. You can confirm which VDC you are in by looking in the top right corner. To go back to all VDCs, click the back arrow. In the Distributed Firewall > General tab of the Services dialog box, select Enable Distributed Firewall . This creates default rules in both the General (L3) and Ethernet (L2) tabs. In the General tab, click the + button to add a new L3 rule. Define the L3 rule: Field Action Name Enter a name for the rule. Source Hover over the field, then click the IP button to enter a single IP address or an IP range. When you're done, click Keep . Destination Hover over the field, then click the IP button to enter a single IP address or an IP range. When you're done, click Keep . Service Hover over the field, then click the IP button to add the relevant Protocol and Port . When you're done, click Keep . Action Select Allow or Deny . Direction Select In , Out or In/Out . Packet Type Select IPv4 , IPv6 or Any . Applied To Hover over the field, then click the + button to select whether to apply the rule to an edge, Org VDC network, virtual machine, Org VDC or security group. Select the specific object then click the right arrow to add it. When you're done, click Keep . When you're done, click Save changes . Creating a group of objects In some VDCs, you may want to use the same set of objects in multiple rules. For example, you may want to group web servers or other application servers together to use in a ruleset. Grouping objects keeps the firewall ruleset clean and easy to read. Creating a group of IP addresses You can create a group of IP addresses (IP set). This can be a combination of individual IPs and IP ranges. To create an IP set: In the Services dialog box, select the Grouping Objects tab. In the IP Sets tab, click the + button. Fill out the fields in the New IP Set dialog box: Field Action Name Enter a name for the IP set, ideally without any spaces or special characters. Description Enter a description for the IP set. IP Addresses Enter the IP addresses that you want to include in the IP set. You can include a combination of individual IP addresses and IP ranges. You can also use CIDR format, for example 192.168.1.1/24 . Inheritance Select this option to enable the IP set to be consumed by underlying scopes. When you're done, click Keep . Creating a group of MAC addresses If you want to use MAC address based filtering, it is easier to group the addresses in a MAC set. In a cloud environment, you need to be prepared for MAC address changes. Tip We recommend that you base firewall rules on VMs, Org VDC networks or security groups for L2 filtering. To create a MAC set: In the Services dialog box, click the Grouping Objects tab. In the MAC Sets tab, click the + button. Fill out the fields in the New MAC Set dialog box: Field Action Name Enter a name for the MAC set. Description Enter a description for the MAC set. MAC Addresses Enter the individual MAC addresses for your servers. Inheritance Select this option to enable the MAC set to be consumed by underlying scopes. When you're done, click Keep . Creating services and service groups Note Currently, you cannot create custom services or service groups. You can use predefined services with relevant protocols and ports in your firewall rules. Service groups contain multiple application ports and components, for example, Microsoft SQL Server requires a number of ports for all different services, which is simplified in the Microsoft SQL Server service group. Creating a security group Security groups enable you to categorise based on the access level required. If you have a number of servers performing similar roles and services, you can create a security group for them. Security groups also enable you to add dynamic members based on VM guest OS name, VM name and VM guest host name In the Services dialog box, click the Grouping Objects tab. In the Security Groups tab, click the + button. In the New Security Group dialog box, enter a Name and Description for the security group. In the Dynamic Member Sets section, click the + button and specify the criteria for the security group. In the image below, any existing VM with App in its name and any VM created in the future with App in its name will be included in the security group. In the Include Members section, instead of creating the members of the group dynamically, you can explicitly specify members to include in the group. Members can include VMs, Org VDC networks, IP sets, MAC sets or security tags. Select the type of object, then select individual objects and click the right arrow to add them to the group. In the Exclude Members section, you can exclude specific objects from the security group. Select the type of object, then select individuval objects and click the right arrow to exclude them from the group. When you're done, click Keep .

    "title": "How to change IPsec VPN settings via the vCloud API | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to change IPsec VPN settings via the vCloud Director API Overview This guide shows you how to retrieve, modify, and submit blocks of XML that represent the configuration of the IPsec VPN tunnels. The guide covers modifications to the local and peer IP addresses, local and peer IDs as well the addition or removal of local and peer subnets. In addition to this, the guide also outlines the steps required to modify the shared secret key used on a given IPsec VPN tunnel. Use cases: Enabling customers to quickly amend IPsec configurations Modifications of this nature are not possible in the vCloud Director graphical user interface without first deleting the existing IPsec VPN configuration entirely and re-entering the settings. Depending on the number of tunnels, this can be a lengthy task. Making changes to the IPsec VPN configuration via the vCloud API can greatly speed up this process. Edge gateway configuration data You can also use the steps in this guide to obtain a backup of the current configuration applied to an edge gateway. You can then use this to restore the configuration of the edge gateway at a later point in time. By following the instructions in this guide you can make amendments to the IPsec VPN configuration without first needing to engage with UKCloud Support. Before you begin Before using the vCloud API to view and update IPsec VPN settings, we recommend that you install a REST client that enables you to access the API. The steps in this article use a Firefox plugin called RESTClient. For information about how to install this plugin, see How to install a REST client to access the vCloud API . You also need to find your API credentials. For more information, see How to access vCloud Director through the vCloud API Obtaining an authorisation token To start interacting with the vCloud API, you first need to obtain an x-vcloud-authorization token; to do this you need to adjust some settings in RESTClient. In your browser, click the RESTClient icon. From the Method menu, select POST . In the API field, enter the API URL you recorded earlier and append the following to the end of the URL: /api/sessions Next add a Basic Authentication header. To do this, from the Authentication menu at the top of the REST Client, select Basic Authentication . In the Basic Authentication dialog box, in the Username field, enter your API username recorded earlier from the API page. In the Password field enter your UKCloud Portal password and then click Okay . The Request section now includes an Authorization header. Next add an Accept header. To do this, from the Headers menu, select Custom Header . In the Request Header dialog box, in the Name field, enter Accept In the Value field enter application/*+xml;version=5.5 and then click Okay . The Headers section should now be displayed, containing the Accept header. The RESTClient has now got all the required settings in place to make a request to the vCloud API to obtain a x-vcloud-authorization token, so click the Send button. When a response is received the Headers tab in the Response section will be populated, including an x-vcloud-authorization token. The x-vcloud-authorization token will replace the Basic Authentication header added earlier. To do this highlight and copy the string of characters displayed after the word x-vcloud-authorization . Note If at any point while following the instructions in this guide, the output displayed in the REST Client does not look similar to that shown in the images, you can use the value of the Status Code field to determine what went wrong and needs investigation. In this case above, Status Code received was HTTP 200 OK, which means that the request succeeded. For a list of HTTP response codes, see HTTP Response Codes . To add an x-vcloud-authorization header, from the Headers menu, select Custom Header . In the Request Header dialog box, in the Name field enter x-vcloud-authorization . In the Value field, paste the string of characters copied in the previous step, then click Okay . Now that you've obtained an x-vcloud-authorization token, you can remove the Basic Authentication Header. Click the x in the upper right-hand corner of the header. ## Retrieving organisation details via the API Retrieving organisation details via the API Now that you've obtained an x-vcloud-authorization token, you can call the vCloud API to retrieve the information that you need about your organisation to set up your IPsec VPN. Set the Method to GET . In the Response section, select the Preview tab. This view lists the links that you can use to drill down into the various objects exposed via the vCloud API. Of interest in the output below is a link that will, when queried, return details about the organisation and the objects contained within it. The link should look something like: https://<api_url>/api/org/<org_id> Copy the URL and paste it into the Request URL field. Click Send . After a short amount of time the contents of the Response Preview tab will be updated to reflect the response from the vCloud API to your latest request, including links to each VDC in the organisation. Retrieving virtual data centre details via the API To retrieve details about the VDCs in an organisation: Copy the link for the VDC containing the target edge gateway for your IPsec VPN. The link should look something like: https>//<api_url>/api/vdc/<vdc_id> Click Send . The contents of the Response Preview tab will be updated again. Retrieving edge gateway configuration via the API To retrieve details of the edge gateway configuration: The response this time will probably be quite long. To easily locate a specific section in the response, use your browser's search utility. You can invoke this in Firefox by pressing CTRL+F . In the search dialog window at the bottom of the screen enter edgeGateways , and then click the down arrow button to locate a section that looks similar to the one shown below: <Link rel=\"edgeGateways\" href=\"https://api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/admin/vdc/<vdc_id>/edgeGateways\" type=\"application/vnd.vmware.vcloud.query.records+xml\" /> Copy the link ending in /edgeGateways and paste it into the URL field at the top of the RESTClient. Ensure that the Method drop down is set to GET and click Send . If this request is successful, the response will contain a link to the edge gateway which, when queried, will return the configuration of the edge gateway. Once you have received a response, use your browser's search utility to locate the EdgeGatewayRecord section within the response. <EdgeGatewayRecord gatewayStatus=\"READY\" haStatus=\"UP\" isBusy=\"false\" name=\"UKCloud Gateway (nft00002i2)\" numberOfExtNetworks=\"1\" numberOfOrgNetworks=\"8\" vdc=\"https://api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/vdc/<vdc_id>\" href=\"https://api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/admin/edgeGateway/<edge_id>\" task=\"https://api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/task/<task_id>\" isSyslogServerSettingInSync=\"true\" taskOperation=\"networkConfigureEdgeGatewayServices\" taskStatus=\"success\" taskDetails=\" \" /> Within the EdgeGatewayRecord section of the above from the response, locate the link to the edge gateway that starts with the following: https://<api_url>/api/admin/edgeGateway/ Appended to the end of the URL will be a unique identifier for the edge gateway within the VDC. Copy this link, paste it into the URL field and then click Send . After a short amount of time the current configuration of the edge gateway will be displayed in a block of XML. Reviewing the edge gateway configuration The edge configuration information is contained between an opening <Configuration> and closing </Configuration> tag. This block of XML is split into sections which detail the configuration settings applied to a specific item, function or service available on the edge gateway. There are twelve sections in total; however only the configuration settings contained under the <GatewayIpsecVpnService> tags will be discussed in this guide. The example below shows a high‑level overview of the structure of the XML block returned, including the <GatewayIpsecVpnServices> tags. <EdgeGateway> <Configuration> <GatewayBackingConfig> </GatewayBackingConfig> <GatewayInterfaces> </GatewayInterfaces> <EdgeGatewayServiceConfiguration> <FirewallService> </FirewallService> <NatService> </NatService> <GatewayIpsecVpnService> </GatewayIpsecVpnService> <StaticRoutingService> </StaticRoutingService> <LoadBalancerService> </LoadBalancerService> </EdgeGatewayServiceConfiguration> <HaEnabled> </HaEnabled> <UseDefaultRouteForDnsRelay> </UseDefaultRouteForDnsRelay> </Configuration> </EdgeGateway\\> Before making any changes to the edge gateway via the API it is highly recommended to keep a copy of the XML returned. You can then use this backup to restore the configuration of the edge gateway to a known working configuration if the need arises. To copy the XML: Select the Response Preview tab of the RESTClient. Scroll down to the opening <Configuration> tag and highlight everything up to and including the closing <\\Configuration> tag. The length of the XML to copy is dependent on the number of NAT, firewall rules and another configuration applied to the edge gateway. With the contents of the <Configuration> tags highlighted, right click and select Copy . Paste the configuration into a text editor, saving the file to a known location on your computer. Using a text editor that offers syntax highlighting such as Notepad++ will simplify the editing process. Locating the IPsec VPN settings in the returned XML To locate the IPsec VPN settings, open a new text editor window and copy and paste the contents between the opening <GatewayIpsecVpnService> and closing </GatewayIpsecVpnService> tags. The contents should look similar to the XML block shown below: <GatewayIpsecVpnService> <IsEnabled>true</IsEnabled> <Endpoint> <Network type=\"application/vnd.vmware.admin.network+xml\" href=\"https://api.vcd.portal.ukcloud.com/api/admin/network/3c284ec8-2850- ba77-098c-7f697a3d8769\"/> <PublicIp>37.26.88.73</PublicIp> </Endpoint> <Tunnel> <Name>UKCloud IPSEC VPN Demo</Name> <Description/> <IpsecVpnThirdPartyPeer> <PeerId>134.170.188.221</PeerId> </IpsecVpnThirdPartyPeer> <PeerIpAddress>134.170.188.221</PeerIpAddress> <PeerId>134.170.188.221</PeerId> <LocalIpAddress>172.26.45.97</LocalIpAddress> <LocalId>172.26.45.97</LocalId> <LocalSubnet> <Name>VPN Test Network 1</Name> <Gateway>192.168.1.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </LocalSubnet> <PeerSubnet> <Name>192.168.2.0/24</Name> <Gateway>192.168.2.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </PeerSubnet> <SharedSecret>UKCloudIPSECVPNDemoSharedSecretKey</SharedSecret> <SharedSecretEncrypted>false</SharedSecretEncrypted> <EncryptionProtocol>AES256</EncryptionProtocol> <Mtu>1500</Mtu> <IsEnabled>true</IsEnabled> <IsOperational>true</IsOperational> </Tunnel> </GatewayIpsecVpnService> Modifying the IPsec VPN configuration This section outlines common tasks performed via the API to manipulate the IPsec VPN configuration applied to a given edge gateway. Modifying the local endpoint IP and local ID You can change the local IP and local ID by editing the contents between the opening <localIpAddress> and closing </localIpAddress> and <localId> and </localId> tags. This is by far the most commonly performed modification to the IPsec VPN configuration via the vCloud API. You can use this to change the local IP address from the IP address assigned to the edge gateway on the transit network to the IP address assigned to the edge gateways on the public network. For the tunnel to come up successfully, the local IP address must be set to the edge gateway's public IP address. The local ID must also match the public IP address specified. Modifying the peer endpoint IP and peer ID If you need to move the remote endpoint of the tunnel to a new device or IP address, then you can adjust the <PeerIpAddress> and <PeerId> tags. When changing the peer IP address of the tunnel you must ensure that the peer ID is also updated to match the new peer IP address. Adding or removing local subnets You can add additional local subnets to the IPsec VPN tunnel. This involves adding a new <LocalSubnet> definition to the IPsec VPN config. Adding or removing peer subnets You can use the same process to add or remove a <PeerSubnet> . Amending the shared secret If you need to update or amend the shared secret on an IPsec VPN, edit the value between the opening <SharedSecret> and closing </SharedSecret> tags. Note The shared secret must be at least 32 characters in length. To enhance the security of the tunnel, we highly recommend that you avoid using dictionary words in the shared secret key. Applying the new configuration When you've updated the relevant sections of the configuration, you can apply it to the edge gateway. Enclose the new configuration in a pair of <EdgeGatewayServiceConfiguration> tags. Copy and paste this configuration into the Request Body section of the RESTClient. From the Method list, select POST .

    "keywords": "How to build a virtual machine with UKCloud for VMware (vCloud Director 8.20) Overview This guide leads you through the three basic steps for using UKCloud for VMware to quickly build a simple virtual machine (VM) in vCloud Director 8.20, and connect it to the internet. For more information about how to use other vCloud Director functions to make the most of UKCloud for VMware and create more complex virtual data centres (VDCs), take a look at the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware . The three steps covered in this guide are: Create a network (to move requests around your VMs) Configure the edge gateway (in this guide we focus on the firewall and NAT configuration) Create a virtual machine If you follow these steps, you can have a VM up and running with a connection to the internet in about 20 to 25 minutes. Note The steps in this guide are for vCloud Director 8.20. If your environment uses vCloud Director 9.1, see here . Before you begin You should have received your UKCloud Portal login credentials from your Portal administrator. You should have created a VDC, compute service and edge gateway within your account. For more information, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware . The steps in this guide assume that you've converted your edge gateway to an advanced edge. For more information, see Converting your edge gateway We recommend that you use the Mozilla Firefox ESR browser as this is supported by the Web Console for the version of vCloud Director used by UKCloud for VMware. For more information, see Browser requirements for services on the UKCloud Platform . Create a network Before you can start building VMs in your VDC, you need to create the network that connects the VMs to each other and the outside world. First, you need to create a network that can connect to external networks outside your VDC (including the internet). This is called an external routed network . Log in to the UKCloud Portal. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal Select your account. In the Portal navigation panel, expand VMware Cloud and then select the compute service in which you want to create your VM. On the vCloud Director tab, enter your password and click Confirm . In vCloud Director, select the Administration tab. Double-click your VDC (or right-click the VDC and choose Open ). You're creating a network, so select the Org VDC Networks tab. To create a new network, click the green + icon (or right-click an empty row and choose Add Network ) to open the New Organization VDC Network dialog box. You want your VM to connect to the internet (rather than just other VMs in the same VDC), so in the Select Network Type page, choose the routed network option. When you connect a network to the outside world, it's important that you control exactly what can access your environment via that network. The UKCloud platform provides each VDC with an edge gateway to do this, so select the edge that you want your new network to use and then click Next (we'll work more with the edge gateway later on). In the Configure Network page, enter the details for the Gateway address , Network mask and Primary DNS . The example below uses 192.168.1.1 for the gateway, 255.255.255.0 for the mask and 8.8.8.8 for the DNS. A VM needs an IP address to identify it on the network. Use the Static IP pool field to identify the IP addresses that VMs connecting to this network can use. You can specify either individual IP addresses (static manual) or a range of IP addresses (static IP pool): For static manual, for each IP address that you want to use, enter the IP address and click Add . For example, if your default gateway is 192.168.1.1 , you can use 192.168.1.2 as a static manual IP address. Continue adding IP addresses as necessary. For static IP pool, enter the range of IP addresses to use and click Add . For example, if your default gateway is 192.168.1.1 , you can use the 192.168.1.10-192.168.1.100 range for your static IP pool, giving 91 usable internal IP addresses. Click Next . Give the network a Name and Description . You can make your network available to your other VDCs within the same region so that VMs can communicate with each other, regardless of which VDC they are in. For example, you may have a single repository server that provides updates for all the VMs in a region. For the purposes of this exercise, leave the Share this network option empty. Click Next to review your settings, and then click Finish . You can find more information about routed networks in How to create a routed VDC network . Configure the edge gateway The edge gateway is possibly the most complex part of the VDC because of its high level of functionality. The following exercise steps you through a quick way to configure the edge gateway to enable you to access the internet from a VM. If you are not already logged in to the UKCloud, log in now and select your account. In the Portal navigation panel, expand VMware Cloud and then select your compute service. On the vCloud Director tab, enter your password and click Confirm . Select the Administration tab. Double-click your VDC (or right-click the VDC and choose Open ). This time you're working with the edge gateway, so select the Edge Gateways tab. Right-click the edge gateway you want to work with and choose Edge Gateway Services . Note The steps that follow describe how to change the edge gateway settings for an advanced gateway. Each tab in the Edge Gateway page provides access to a different service provided by the edge gateway. The main tabs are: Firewall - As well as a physical firewall, you can control which networks and ports can communicate through the edge gateway. You'll set up some firewall rules later in this exercise. DHCP - The edge gateway can act as a DHCP server for VMs connected to Org networks connected to an edge. The DHCP tab shows DHCP information for any Org networks that have been configured with DHCP, and so acts as a centralised view. For more information, see How to create a DHCP pool . NAT - Network address translation, both in (DNAT) and out (SNAT) of the edge gateway. You'll set up some NAT rules later in this exercise. Routing - You can provide static routes from the edge gateway to other networks, for example networks in other VDCs in your compute service. For more information, see How to create a static route . Load Balancer - The edge gateway provides simple HTTP and HTTPS load balancing using round robin. For more information, see How to configure a load balancer . VPN - IPsec site‑to‑site VPN is available on the edge gateway. It can be configured within the vCloud user interface, but may require additional configuration through the API. For more information, see How to configure IPsec VPN . To access the internet from a VM, you'll need to create firewall rules to determine who can access your network and NAT rules to route traffic within your network. Let's start with the firewall rules. Select the Firewall tab and make sure the Enabled option is selected. Click the + button to add a new row to the firewall rules table. Edit the values in the row for the New Rule using the settings below: Name - HTTPS outbound Source - internal Destination - external Service - Click the + button and enter the following values in the Add Service dialog box Protocol - TCP Source Port - any Destination Port - 443 Click Keep when you're done. Action - Accept These settings allow traffic from the VMs ( Source = internal ) to reach destinations outside your VDC ( Destination = external ) on port 443 . You'll need to repeat these steps for ports 80 and 53 . You can also allow traffic to reach your VMs from outside your VDC by swapping the Source and Destination values. However, because this opens up your firewall to a lot of traffic, we recommend that you first complete this guide to get comfortable with general networking concepts, and then take a look at the information in How to create firewall rules where you can find out how to lock the firewall down. Click Save changes Now that you've set up the firewall rules, you can create NAT rules, so select the NAT tab. Click the + SNAT Rule button to create a source NAT (SNAT) rule to translate internal IP addresses into something that the external network can understand. In the Add SNAT Rule dialog box, from the Applied on list, choose the edge gateway to which you want to apply the SNAT rule. In the Original Source IP/Range field, enter the range of addresses you created when you created the network in the previous exercise. In the Translated Source IP/Range field, enter one or more of the external IP addresses provided to you by UKCloud. If you are not sure what your IP addresses are, see How to find your allocated external IP addresses . When you're done, click Keep and then Save changes . You can also add destination NAT (DNAT) rules to translate external IP addresses to route traffic to the appropriate internal addresses. However, because the firewall only provides outbound access to the internet, we don't need to add DNAT rules at the moment. You can find more information about setting up NAT rules in How to create NAT rules . Create a virtual machine Now that you've laid the groundwork, it's time to create your VM. The best way to do this is to create a virtual application (vApp). You can think of a vApp as a container for your VMs—it enables you to group related VMs together to manage them in one place. See How to create a vApp to find out more. If you are not already logged in to the UKCloud, log in now and select your account. In the Portal navigation panel, expand VMware Cloud and then select your compute service. On the vCloud Director tab, enter your password and click Confirm . In this exercise, you'll create the vApp from scratch, so on the Home tab, click the Build New vApp button. In the New vApp dialog, give the vApp a Name and Description . From the Virtual Datacenter list, choose your VDC. For the purposes of this exercise, you can keep the default Runtime lease and Storage lease , so click Next . In the Add Virtual Machines page, you can create your VM. Add a VM from the UKCloud public catalog by choosing Public Catalogs from the Look in list. Find and select the VM that you want to use, click the Add button and then click Next . You can use the filter fields to limit which VMs appear in the list and use the arrow buttons to scroll through the results. On the Configure Resources page, you can change the VM name in the Virtual Machine field, but keep the default Storage Policy option. Click Next . On the Configure Virtual Machines page, from the Network list, select the externally routed network you created in the first exercise. From the IP Assignment list, choose Static -- IP Pool to use the IP pool you defined earlier when you created your network. You also have another opportunity here to change the name of the VM (in the Computer Name field). Click Next . You don't need to change anything on the Configure Networking page, so click Next . You can find out about network fencing in How to create a vApp network . On the Ready to Complete page, review your settings and then click Finish to start the deployment. When the VM has been provisioned, right-click it and select Power On , then use the popout console to go through the setup procedure. To confirm that you have connectivity to the internet and have an assigned IP address: Type ipconfig into the Command Prompt. If you've configured the networking correctly, your VM will return an IP address. Open an internet browser page and navigate to an external web page Ping the IP address of your DNS (for example, 8.8.8.8 ) through the command line. Next steps In this guide, you've learned how to build a simple virtual machine and connect it to the internet.

On the Infrastructure -- Oracle VM Cloud Services page you can view and manage all your Oracle VMs. More information! How to build an Oracle virtual machine Setting up your network Before you can start using the VMs in your Oracle environment, you need to create the network that connects the VMs to each other, and potentially also to the outside world. This network enables your VMs to communicate with each other or access external networks. A single Oracle tenant can have multiple networks. When UKCloud sets up a new Oracle tenant for you, we'll usually create an edge gateway for that tenant, but the creation of any networks is your responsibility. Networking and connectivity for UKCloud for Oracle Software is managed within vCloud Director, which you access through the UKCloud Portal rather than Enterprise Manager Cloud Control. Note Because you create your network in vCloud Director, you'll see references to VMware terminology, such as organisations and virtual data centres (VDCs). In UKCloud for Oracle Software, an Oracle tenant is equivalent to a VDC. There are two types of network: An isolated (internally connected) network provides access only to the VMs within the Oracle tenant (see How to create an isolated VDC network ). A routed (externally connected) network provides access to machines and networks outside the Oracle tenant via the edge gateway. You can have up to nine usable routed networks per tenant: one for each connectivity type (see How to create a routed VDC network ). Configuring your edge gateway An edge gateway controls how traffic from the outside world comes into and out of your environment. It is very important to make sure that your edge gateway is configured correctly to make your applications available but also secure. The tools for configuring your edge gateway are provided within vCloud Director, which you access through the UKCloud Portal rather than Enterprise Manager Cloud Control. Your edge gateway provides the following services: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) --- The edge gateway can act as a DHCP server for VMs connected to VDC networks connected to an edge (see How to create a DHCP pool ). Network address translation (NAT) --- NAT rules determine where to direct inbound and outbound traffic (see How to create NAT rules ). Firewall --- The firewall controls which networks and ports can communicate through the edge gateway (see How to create firewall rules ). Static routing --- Provides static routes from the edge gateway to other networks, for example, networks in other VDCs in your compute service (see How to create a static route ). VPN --- IPsec site-to-site VPN is available on the edge gateway (see How to configure IPsec VPN ). Load balancing --- The edge gateway provides simple HTTP and HTTPS load balancing using round robin (see How to configure a load balancer ). Logging out of the Cloud Control console When you're done working in the Cloud Control console, we recommend that you log out to prevent unauthorised access. To log out of the Cloud Control console, click your user name and select Log Out . Next steps In this Getting Started Guide, you've learned the basics about UKCloud for Oracle Software.

    "keywords": "How to use the OpenStack Command Line Client on Microsoft operating systems Overview OpenStack has been designed and built specifically for the Linux community utilising the Python programming language. Despite this, it's still possible to use the OpenStack Command Line Client on a Microsoft operating system using PowerShell, and this document outlines the six simple steps to achieve this. Install Python runtime and libraries Set Windows environmental variables Install pip - Python packaging manager Install the OpenStack Command Line Client Bind your OpenStack credentials using the OpenStack RC file Test your configuration Prerequisites This document assumes you're running a version of Windows from XP upwards and that Windows PowerShell is already installed and available. All details outlined in this document have been tested against Windows 7 SP1 Enterprise. Installation Steps Install Python runtime and libraries Download the latest Python 2 release from the Python website: http://python.org/downloads/windows/ Note The OpenStack client currently only supports Python 2.7, Python 3+ is unsupported). After clicking the most recent Python 2 release, download the Windows X86-64 MSI Installer. Install Python by double-clicking the MSI package that you just downloaded and completing the installation wizard. Set the environmental variables For Windows to be aware of Python you need to declare its path as follows: Open the Computer settings. Select Advanced system settings . Select Environment variables . In the Environment Variables dialog box, find the Path variable in the System variables list and click Edit . In the Edit System Variable dialog box, in the Variable value field, add the following to the end of the value (make sure to include the semicolons): ;C:\\Python27;C:\\Python27\\Scripts Click OK Note Update the above paths if you choose to change the Python installer defaults. Close the remaining windows. Install pip Open a command prompt with Admin rights by right-clicking on the command prompt icon (when you get a login prompt, enter your admin credentials). Install pip by entering the following command: easy_install pip If successful, you should see a screen like the following: [!IMPORTANT] Leave the command prompt open for the next step. Install the OpenStack Command Line client Install the OpenStack client with the following command: pip install python-openstackclient Installing the client may take between 1 to 5 minutes depending upon your machine. Bind your OpenStack credentials After successful installation, you'll have to download the OpenStack RC file for the project you want to manage. Log in to the OpenStack Horizon dashboard. Open the project you want to manage. From the menu, select Access & Security and then select the API Access tab. Click Download OpenStack RC File and save the file in a convenient place. Note If your OpenStack user account is SSO-enabled, see How to use the OpenStack API using an SSO enabled user for the changes you need to make to the RC file for SSO. Download the Source-OpenRC.ps1 PowerShell script and save it locally. As the downloaded PowerShell script is unsigned, you'll need to unblock it by right-clicking the file, selecting Properties , then clicking the Unblock button and clicking OK . Start Windows PowerShell from the Start menu. Run the downloaded PowerShell script, and give the path to the downloaded RC file as an argument, for example: C:\\Downloads\\Source-OpenRC.ps1 C:\\Downloads\\project-openrc.sh Note Replace Downloads with the directory you saved your files to and replace project-openrc.sh with the openrc.sh filename you downloaded. When prompted, enter your OpenStack project password. Test your configuration Now you've installed and configured the everything, you can start using the command line tools. Note You'll need to run the PowerShell script defined above, and provide your OpenStack project credentials every time you relaunch PowerShell. Test if everything is working with a simple list command: openstack server list If you've started with an empty project, you'll get output similar to the following: +----+------+--------+------------+-------------+----------+ | ID | Name | Status | Task State | Power State | Networks | +----+------+--------+------------+-------------+----------+ +----+------+--------+------------+-------------+----------+ Note If you enter your password incorrectly, you will see a message similar to: The request you have made requires authentication. (HTTP 401) (Request-ID: req-..) Upgrading clients The community regularly releases updates to the OpenStack CLI, therefore we suggest you check for updates to the client to ensure you have access to all the latest features; this can also help to resolve errors you experience when using the OpenStack CLI. Upgrade pip Open a command prompt with Admin rights by right-clicking on the command prompt icon (when you get a login prompt, enter your admin credentials). Upgrade pip by entering the following command: python -m pip install --upgrade pip Note Once successfully upgraded, leave the command prompt open for the next step. Upgrade the OpenStack Command Line client Install pip with the following command: pip install --upgrade python-openstackclient Installing the client may take between 1 to 5 minutes depending upon your machine.

Step 1 - Browse to the virtual machine within the vApp Step 2 - Right click the virtual machine and click install tools Step 3 - Login to the operating system and follow the wizard to install the tools Step 4 - Reboot Linux There are two methods of installing the VMware tools for Linux, from within vCloud Director using the method above or installing the open-vm-tools, which are now supported by VMware. Not all distributions provide support for the open-vm-tools however the following well known distributions do: Centos 5/6/7 Redhat 5/6/7 Ubuntu 12.04/14.04 Installing the VMware tools via vCloud Director requires modules to be built against the running kernel. If the kernel is updated the administrator needs to run the VMWare tools setup again to recompile the modules. UKCloud recommends using the open-vm-tools because this maintenance is handled by the package manager when the kernel is updated. Redhat/Centos 5/6/7 The open-vm-tools is available via the epel repository.

    "keywords": "Virtual machine disk limits and considerations In order to ensure the performance and stability of a customer's VM, whilst also being able to ensure the integrity and validity of VM back-ups, UKCloud advises the following soft limits on storage presented to individual VMs; 2032 GB for each virtual disk (VMDK) presented to a VM, this will ensure normal snapshot functions will operate correctly Maximum of 20 virtual disks presented to a VM Maximum of 40TB overall storage presented to a VM Storage Controllers Increasing the number of disks per controller can have a performance impact, for high I/O machines we'd recommend minimizing the disk to controller ratio, also using the paravirtualised controller can result in greater throughput and lower CPU use. Note VMware Tools is a pre-requisite for the deployment of paravirtualised disks. Snapshots A VMware snapshot is a copy of a VM's disk at a given point in time, it is not a complete copy of the original and rather it only copies the delta disks. An excessive number of delta files in a chain (caused by an excessive number of snapshots) or large delta files may cause decreased virtual machine and host performance. UKCloud recommends the removal of snapshots on a regular basis 24-72 hours in line with VMware best practices to maintain consistent performance of VMs. There will be times when standard platform maintenance tasks need to be performed, resulting in VMs moving around the infrastructure. VMs with large (2TB) hard disks presented will take an extended time for operations to complete, during which time other tasks against the VM could be blocked. UKCloud strongly recommends, where possible, to scale environments horizontally instead of vertically. We understand this may not always be possible, however in doing so you are ensuring reliability and consistency of performance in the environment as it grows, for further design considerations or assistance contact your Account Director who will be able to put you in touch with one of our Cloud Architects.

    "keywords": "Virtual machine data recovery options Introduction There are three methods of creating a recovery point for your virtual machines (VMs): VM snapshot - provides the ability to rollback or recover from a change. We recommend that snapshots on a single VM do not span more than 14 days for performance reasons elaborated on below. VM copy - creates a master image to clone additional VMs from an existing VM. VM backup - provides disaster recovery from file corruption or deletion. Each of these methods is discussed below to ensure that you are able to backup and recover your data in the most efficient and appropriate way. VM snapshot When you create a VM snapshot, you grab a VM and all its data and configuration at a specific point in time (a snapshot). This is achieved by locking the main image of the VM, writing all subsequent updates, creations or deletions to a separate file (a delta) outside of your main image. Use case When planning to deploy a kernel upgrade in Linux, take a snapshot prior to performing the upgrade. When you have applied and successfully tested the upgrade, you should remove the snapshot. If the upgrade is not successful or does not pass the quality check, you can simply rollback the changes by reverting to the snapshot. Pros You are able to complete this task autonomously, without intervention by UKCloud. You can create a temporary recovery point while the VM is still running and then quickly rollback from any changes or updates made to the VM, should undesirable outcomes occur (for example, during a Windows Update). Cons You can create only one snapshot for each VM, with each subsequent snapshot overwriting the previous one. You should use snapshots only as a temporary solution, as the longer the snapshot is running, the more changes will be lost should the snapshot be restored. In addition, due to the way that snapshots capture all changes to a separate file, storage costs will increase as a result of having to store both the original master VM image and you may also encounter a negative impact to the overall performance of the VM. How to create a VM snapshot Using vCloud Director 8.20 Using vCloud Director 9.1 You can create a VM snapshot within the UKCloud vCloud Director Control Panel by right-clicking the VM that you want to create a snapshot for and selecting Create Snapshot . In the card for the VM that you want to create a snapshot for, click More and select Create Snapshot . VM copy When you copy a VM, you create an exact replica of the VM in either the same vApp or a different vApp. Use case When creating a web application that can scale across multiple VMs of the same configuration, you can build an image to the required specification and then copy that VM to create a master image (gold build). When required, you can deploy subsequent VMs from this gold build in a consistent fashion, enabling swift scaling of your environment. Pros You can easily create a gold build of VMs, thereby creating one image that you can then use to create additional VMs in a controlled and consistent fashion, without having to build each VM completely from scratch. Cons You must power down the VM prior to taking a copy. Each additional copy will consume as much storage as the original and consume additional memory and CPU cycles while the VMs are running. How to create a VM copy Using vCloud Director 8.20 Using vCloud Director 9.1 You can create a VM copy within the UKCloud vCloud Director Control Panel by right-clicking the VM that you want to copy and selecting Copy to . In the vCloud Director 9.1 tenant portal, you can only copy entire vApps. To copy a single VM, you need to switch to the vCloud Director Web Console and follow the steps for vCloud Director 8.20. VM backup You should view backup as a disaster recovery mechanism, whereby you can restore entire environments or individual files in the event of the original becoming unavailable as a result of corruption or accidental deletion. You can add any VM to the automated snapshot backup schedule so that it is automatically backed up on a daily basis. You can choose to retain snapshot backups for either 14 or 28 days. Data is backed up at the hypervisor level and provides a crash‑consistent image. Use case If you accidentally delete or amend a file that should not be modified, you can restore the file in question from backup by raising a Service Request via the UKCloud Portal. Pros You gain peace of mind that data is backed up nightly for a rolling period of 14 or 28 days without any manual intervention. Cons Time taken for a restoration request to be completed (dependent on the amount of data to be restored). How to add a VM to the automated snapshot backup schedule For information about how to add a VM to the automated backup schedule, see How to manage snapshot protection for your VMs in the Knowledge Centre.

Changes to APIs For information about the changes to the vCloud API used by vCloud Director 9.1, see the vCloud API Schema Differences document. You should be aware of the following end-of-life and end-of-support warnings for older vCloud API versions in vCloud Director 9.1: vCloud Director 9.1 no longer supports vCloud API versions 1.5 and 5.1. These API versions were deprecated in a previous release. vCloud Director 9.1 is the last release of vCloud Director to support any vCloud API versions earlier than 20.0. Those API versions are deprecated in this release and will not be supported in future releases. Known issues There are some tasks, including managing standard edges, that are not currently possible using the vCloud Director 9.1 tenant portal. To perform these tasks, you must use the vCloud Director web console. For more information, including a list of tasks that must be performed in the web console, see How to switch to the vCloud Director web console from the tenant portal . For information about converting your edge to an advanced gateway, which can be managed in the tenant portal, see How to convert your edge to an advanced gateway . If you disable your firewall, NAT and Load Balancing features are also disabled. This applies to both standard and advanced edge gateways in vCloud Director 9.1. To avoid any potential issues, we recommend that you review your edge configuration, apply appropriate rules and enable the firewall. We also recommend that firewalls should be enabled as part of best practice to reduce attack vectors on your cloud environment. Before you perform any work on the edge, we strongly recommend that you take a backup of the configuration via the API as a restore point.

    "keywords": "Oversized VMs on the UKCloud platform Although UKCloud recommend a maximum permitted configuration of 8vCPU and 96GB RAM for Virtual machines (VMs), a small number of customers have been creating customised VM's that exceed this configuration. We understand that customers may have been doing this in an effort to increase VM performance, and in the most extreme scenarios customers have assigned more vCPU and Memory than is physically available on the host. Unfortunately, this approach does not necessarily increase VM performance and in many circumstances this has the opposite effect. UKCloud have configured the platform to dynamically move workloads to quieter hosts when the current host experiences a sustained level of increased activity. By increasing the resource requirements, the ability to move a VM from a busy host to quieter host is significantly impacted. As the VM resources are increased, the likelihood of that amount being free on another host is significantly diminished which effectively locks the VM to the current host. The impact to a customer VM is twofold: Reducing the reliability of performance Potentially affecting VM availability in the case of a failure UKCloud must also consider the impact that these abnormally large VMs have on other users of the platform as the increased VMs consume additional resources and cause performance issues for other VMs. With this mind, UKCloud advises customers that VMs that exceed the maximum available in our current G Cloud service description for UKCloud for VMware are not allowed. We are currently scoping a technical fix to stop further creation of VMs that exceed the maximum permitted configuration. In the interim, we will be running regular reports to identify customers with VMs that breach these limits. In the first instance we will contact customers to help them overcome some of the issues they are experiencing, but we reserve the right to terminate excessively large VMs should they start to affect the stability of the platform for other UKCloud customers.

    "keywords": "How to create a virtual protection group Overview A virtual protection group (VPG) is a collection of virtual machines (VMs) that are grouped together for some purpose, for example data protection, disaster recovery or workload migration. When you create a VPG, a replica virtual disk is created on the target site (for recovery or migration) for each VM in the VPG. These replica disks are then populated with the data in the source VMs by synchronising the VMs with the target site replicas. After the initial synchronisation completes, any writes to disk from the VMs in the source site are sent to the target site. These writes are stored in the target site in journals. Intended audience This guide is intended for users who are: Setting up Disaster Recovery as a Service Setting up Journaling Protection Migrating workloads onto the UKCloud platform For Journaling Protection, you must have access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal in the UKCloud zone in which the VMs that you want to protect are located. For Disaster Recovery as a Service or Migration to the Cloud, you must have access to the Zerto Virtual Manager Web Client in the local environment in which the VMs that you want to protect or migrate are located. Creating a virtual protection group in the Zerto Self-Service Portal (Journaling Protection) If you're creating a VPG for Journaling Protection, you specify the vApp to protect and all the VMs in that vApp are included in the VPG. Log in to the ZSSP. For more detailed instructions, see How to access the Zerto Self-Service Portal . Use the ZSSP login link for the zone in which the VMs that you want to protect are located. Select the VPGs tab and then click NEW VPG . In the Create VPG dialog, specify the VPG Name . The name must be unique and contain no more than 80 characters. From the Available VMs list, select the vApp that contains the VMs that you want to protect. From the Recovery Site list, choose your target site. From the Org vDC list, choose the VDC in which you want to replicate the VMs. UKCloud provides a single Service Profile : System Service Profile . Click SAVE . At this point, the selected VMs are synchronised to the target site. This synchronisation between the source site and target site may take some time, depending on the size of the VMs. After the initial synchronisation, all the VMs in the VPG are fully protected and all write operations to those VMs are sent to the journal. After the initial creation of your VPG, you need to edit it to determine what happens during disaster recovery. On the VPGs tab, click the pencil icon next to your VPG Name . From the Priority list, choose the priority of transferring data from the source site to the target site for this VPG when there is limited bandwidth and more than one VPG is defined on the source site. High - Updates from VPGs with high priority are passed over the WAN first Medium - Updates from VPGs with medium priority use whatever bandwidth is left after the high priority VPGs have used it Low - Updates from VPGs with low priority use whatever bandwidth is left after the medium VPGs have used it Click NEXT . In the VMs page, you can see the VMs that are included in the VPG. Click NEXT . In the REPLICATION page, you can see the options you selected for the Recovery Site and Recovery Org vDC . To change the Storage Profile used for the VMs in the VPG, click VM SETTINGS . You cannot change the Journal Size or Journal Warning Threshold . Click OK when you're done. Click NEXT . The STORAGE page displays the storage used for the VM data (by default, this is the same storage as that used for the VM definition). If you want to edit the storage settings for a VM, select the VM and then click EDIT SELECTED . Note Make sure that the Thin checkbox is selected for all VMs. When you've finished setting the options for each of the VMs, click NEXT . In the RECOVERY page, from the Failover/Move Network list, choose the network to use in the target site for a live failover. From the Failover Test Network list, choose the network to use in the target site for a test failover of VMs. If you select Isolated , the network interface controller (NIC) will not be connected to the VM when it's brought up in the target site. vCD Guest Customization controls whether the failed‑over VM is subject to guest customization to set its IP address inside its operating system. Click NEXT . In the NICs page, specify the network interface controller (NIC) to use for the VMs after a live or test failover. Note If you specify different IP addresses (or use IP Pool ) for the IP addresses here, you must enable vCD Guest Customization on the RECOVERY page. Click NEXT . The System Service Profile does not permit Backup Services, so click NEXT again. In the SUMMARY page, review the options you have selected for the VPG and click DONE to create the VPG. Creating a virtual protection group in Zerto Virtual Manager (Disaster Recovery as a Service and Migration to the Cloud) If you're creating a VPG for Disaster Recovery as a Service or Migration to the Cloud, use the ZVM Web Client in your local environment. When you create the VPG, you specify the individual VMs that you want to protect or migrate. Log in to the ZVM Web Client. Select the VPGs tab and then click NEW VPG . On the NEW VPG page of the Create VPG dialog, specify the VPG Name . From the Priority list, choose the priority of transferring data from the source site to the target site for this VPG when there is limited bandwidth and more than one VPG is defined on the source site. High - Updates from VPGs with high priority are passed over the WAN first Medium - Updates from VPGs with medium priority use whatever bandwidth is left after the high priority VPGs have used it Low - Updates from VPGs with low priority use whatever bandwidth is left after the medium VPGs have used it Click NEXT .

No known issues with 10.3.1. Known issues with v10.2.8 (Previous Version) Windows In the UKCloud for VMware section, entering an amount of additional storage GiB without selecting the Storage type does not display an error message. If you specify an amount of storage without specify a Storage type, the storage is added to the estimate but the calculation shows the additional storage as being free, which is incorrect. Workaround: When including additional storage in your estimate, be sure to select the storage type first. If you select a storage type but do not enter a storage amount, an error message is displayed. Mac The following are known issues with the Mac version of the Pricing Estimation Tool. You cannot select a date in the date picker. Instead you must enter the date manually. When creating an estimate for Cloud GPU for HPC , if you click the increase counter for Cloud GPU Cards the number is added twice. You'll need to manually edit the field to remove the duplicated number. If you select Save as from the main menu, you'll see the following error message: If you click Abort , the tool closes and your estimate will not be saved. Instead, click OK to save the estimate successfully. If you minimise the tool's window, there is no way to resize it. You must close the tool and reopen it.

    "title": "Terminating your UKCloud services | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Terminating your UKCloud services Overview UKCloud is easy to adopt, easy to use and easy to leave, so our intention is to make the service termination process, sometimes referred to as offboarding, as simple as possible. This article clearly outlines customer and UKCloud responsibilities for terminating your UKCloud services. Notice requirements The notice required to terminate UKCloud services varies depending on the service. For UKCloud notice period requirements on a per-product basis, refer to Services at a glance . Single service termination vs account termination You can request the termination of one or more services within your account. In this case, the termination is restricted to the chargeable items within that service (for example, a VMware environment within a customer account). If you want to terminate your whole account with UKCloud, you must raise separate termination requests for each service associated with your customer contract. The final stage of the termination of a complete customer account will be the decommissioning of the last UKCloud Portal user, decommissioning of all customer reports and termination of the ability to access customer ticket details and service reports through the Portal. Customer responsibilities When you decide to terminate a service, you should first contact your Technical Account Manager (TAM) or Cloud Delivery Manager (CDM). Your TAM or CDM will help you to determine the relevant environment details for termination and the Effective Date of Termination. After speaking to your TAM or CDM, an administrator of your Portal account must raise a Service Request via the Portal, following the relevant prompts for information to enable our support team to action the request as quickly as possible. Note If you do not raise a Service Request to initiate a formal termination of service, your environment may not be completely decommissioned and you may end up still being charged for objects remaining on the platform. Before the decommissioning of the services can take place, you are responsible for the removal of all the data within the environment. Refer to Responsibilities by service below for a list of environment items that you need to clear ahead of UKCloud decommissioning the service. Note If you do not remove all the environment items listed, UKCloud will not be able to complete the termination process and you may still be charged for those remaining items. All users with access to the service being terminated must be removed from the Portal by an administrator within the customer organisation. UKCloud responsibilities After you've removed all of the items from your account that you're responsible for, UKCloud will: Remove service-specific environment items as listed in Responsibilities by service below. Securely and permanently erase any residual customer data and configurations that remain. Our data removal solution is independently validated by periodic IT Security Health Check tests. While the solution does not align with the documented requirements of HMG IA Standard No.5, it has successfully passed all CHECK/ITSHC activities, and has been assessed and validated by the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) on behalf of specific customers. Remove your account (and company, if necessary). Return any prepaid sums for services that you have not consumed (unless otherwise required by the associated Service Definition). Arrange to return all confidential information. Costs There are no termination costs associated with cancelling UKCloud services. However, you should consider the following: You are responsible for extracting your own data from the service and any costs that may incur. We may make additional charges for transferring data out of the service. We reserve the right to pass through third-party price rises that are not within our direct control. If you use service options with minimum terms, such as Global Load Balancing or Application-tuned DDoS Protection, you will continue to be charged for these until the end of those terms. We reserve the right to charge for any content that you leave in your environment or for retrieving and returning your content.

    "keywords": "UKCloud Knowledge Centre article template The first thing in your article after the metadata should be the main article title. Use the following to help you decide on the title for your article Titles (and all other headings) should be in sentence caps (that is, the first word should start with an uppercase letter and all other words should be all lowercase unless they are proper nouns) Use a single # for the article title (and don't forget the space after the #) How To Guide titles should start with How to and then a verb to describe the task described in the article, for example How to create a virtual machine . Reference Guides should start with a noun if possible Generally, you should not include any text below the article title, but should go straight to the first ( Overview ) heading. However, if the article is very short and does not require any subheadings, you can include the content directly below the article title. Overview The first section after the article title should be Overview and should provide an introduction to the purpose of the article. Intended audience For How To Guides, if appropriate, you can include an Intended audience subsection below the Overview section to indicate any particular access or permissions a user might need to complete the steps in the task described by the guide. Further sections Use additional sections to break the article up into manageable chunks to make it easier to read. Section headings should be in sentence caps (that is, the first word should start with an uppercase letter and all other words should be all lowercase unless they are proper nouns). In How To articles, you may just have a single additional section describing the task being described in the article -- you should use gerunds for the section headings (words ending in -ing). For example Logging into the OpenStack Horizon dashboard . If the article includes multiple tasks, put each task into its own section. Reference Guides can include as many sections as necessary to keep the content easy to read. But don't use too many levels of subsections as it can be difficult for users to keep track of where they are if the subsections go too deep. Bulleted lists Bulleted lists Look Like this with sub lists if required Numbered lists for How To Guides Numbered lists In a How To Guide Look Like this you can include bulleted lists More useful markdown Images Markdown for images looks like: ![alt-text](images/image-filename.png) The alt-text is read out by screen readers and provides a brief description of the image to help visually impaired users determine what the image is illustrating.

You have access to copy or export your data at any point in life working with UKCloud and further options may exist that are not covered here. Before you begin You can package and export your data in a number of different ways, however we recommend that you read the following documents: Blueprint: Exporting and importing vApps and vApp templates - A technical case for transfer of data in UKCloud for VMware Getting Started Guide for Cloud Storage - Covers the use APIs for access to our storage service Exporting data You can use any of the following methods to export data: Internet, government secure network or leased line data copy Data load room (self-service) Data load room (UKCloud SFIA) Customer-hosted equipment Internet, government secure network or leased line data copy All customers have some form of connectivity to the UKCloud platform to consume services, whether that be an internet facing connection or through one of the approved or government secure network connections. These connections are used for the management of services and may also have been used for copying data to the UKCloud platform. Therefore, the first option for exporting data is to make use of these existing connections. Data load room (self-service) If you want to make use of UKCloud's facilities, we maintain a data room where you can access both the Assured and Elevated security domains by appointment. Your staff or assigned representatives can attend site for a pre-booked number of days and copy data to the provided machines, with the expectation that this data is then moved onto removable media, for example USB hard disks, to be transported. For more information about booking and using this service, see the Data Transfer Facility Service Scope . Data load room (UKCloud SFIA) Similar to the self service option, this option copies data from your environment to, typically, removable media provided by you. For more information about booking and using this service, see the Data Transfer Facility Service Scope . Customer-hosted equipment Where you have hosted equipment at a UKCloud data centre for part of the solution, for example the hosting of communications equipment, you can also leverage this in a similar way to the data load room. If you have equipment hosted at UKCloud, you may request access using a normal Service Request via the UKCloud Portal.

    "keywords": "Best practice customer guide Overview At UKCloud, we strive to ensure that our products deliver the most value to your business. To help us to achieve this, we've created this guide with useful information to ensure good performance from our products and other helpful advice. Best Practices - UKCloud for VMware This section provides some best practices to ensure you get the most out of UKCloud for VMware. Updating old edge gateways To use the latest version of our vCloud product, it's important that you're using the most up to date edge gateway. Older edges are unsupported and not compatible with our latest products and could cause performance issues and disruption to your service. You can find out the latest version of the edge you're using in our vCentre. To upgrade your edge, see How to upgrade your edge gateway . Removing out of date snapshots Snapshot Protection automatically takes an image of the protected VM every 24 hours and stores the image outside the core platform for either 14 or 28 days, depending on your chosen snapshot retention profile. You should remove snapshots that are no longer needed within 24-48 hours. If snapshots aren't removed, this can cause the following issues: Depending on the size of the snapshot, it may delay the time it takes your virtual machine to power on Snapshot back-ups are likely to fail You may be billed for additional storage due to the size of the snapshot To reduce this potential impact, ensure that you remove any old snapshots within 48 hours once they are no longer needed. For more information, see the following articles: Virtual machine disk limits and considerations and Snapshot Protection FAQs . Resolving failed backups There are many reasons why a back-up may fail. The main occurrences are where the VM is over 2TB or where a database has a high change rate. Occasionally, the VM may not be suitable for this type of backup. If your backups have failed three times within a 14-day period, our engineers will be in touch to make you aware and discuss troubleshooting options. For more information, see the following articles: Snapshot Protection Service Scope and Snapshot Protection FAQs . Creating affinity rules Affinity and anti-affinity rules determine if VMs are kept together as they are moved around within an environment. Affinity rules keep VMs together on the same host Anti-affinity rules ensure that VMs are distributed across different hosts For example, if it is important that your application has very low latency, you can create affinity rules to make sure that the application's VMs are always kept on the same host. If you want your application to be robust in the event of host failures, you can create anti‑affinity rules to spread the VMs across multiple hosts. If you're considering setting affinity rules, please be aware of the impact this may have if a host becomes unavailable at any time. For information on affinity and anti-affinity rules, see How to use affinity and anti-affinity rules . Maintaining updated VMware Tools VMware provides tools that we recommend you install into any virtual machines running on UKCloud. These tools provide additional features, such as automated customisation, as well as improved performance by implementing optimised drivers, such as storage, network and display. As UKCloud releases upgraded products, VMware Tools may become out of date and you may experience slow performance and potentially some failures. For information on how to ensure your VMware Tools are up to date, see VMware Tools installation . Enabling firewalls At UKCloud, we take the security of your data very seriously and want to make sure that your data is never at risk from being compromised. If your firewall is disabled for any reason, your data may become compromised and open to potential attack. We strongly recommend that you ensure that your firewalls are always enabled and that your source traffic has been specified to meet your security requirements. For more information on ensuring your firewalls are enabled, see How to create firewall rules . Backing up edge gateway configuration If you want to export your edge gateway configuration data (firewall rules, NAT rules, load balancer virtual servers and DHCP pools), for example, for backup or disaster recovery purposes, you can use PowerShell. If you do not export your edge configuration data before redeployment of an edge, you will not be able to roll back to a previous version if the redeployment is unsuccessful. For more information, see How to export vCNS Edge configuration data using PowerShell . Capturing edge gateway logs VMware logs can be a useful way of identifying a root cause for an issue and troubleshooting. These logs can only be viewed by our engineers at UKCloud and cannot be accessed through the UKCloud Portal. If an edge is redeployed, these logs will be deleted and cannot be recovered. If you'd like to retain your VMware logs and are planning to redeploy an edge, raise a ticket requesting these logs. Allow two days for this request to be completed. Setting up syslog collection Your edge gateway is globally configured to send syslog messages to a specific IP address. By configuring a new network or IP address within your virtual data centre (VDC) and deploying a collector with the syslog IP address, you can access your edge gateway syslog data. You can then use this data to check: Allowed and denied network traffic Load balancer statistics Load balancer health For more information, see How to access syslog data for your edge gateway . Choosing the appropriate compute sizing At UKCloud, we're proud to provide a range of products, solutions and pricing tailored to suit the needs of your business. We've designed our compute 't-shirt' sizes with the optimum level of RAM and CPU to deliver ideal performance. However, if these levels are increased, this may degrade performance over time. For more information on the range of VM sizes that we offer, see our latest Pricing Guide on the Digital Marketplace. Best Practices - general information Maintaining up-to-date contacts for your account In the event of an incident, it's important that we have the correct contact details for you. Ensure that: Your account has two nominated administrators. The administrator has access rights to create and set up new users and reset passwords. In the event of an incident, our support team will always contact the administrator first to resolve the issue. Your contact details are up to date. Please review account permissions regularly when people leave your business or change roles to ensure they are correct There are contact details listed for both primary and secondary technical contacts. We proactively create support tickets for these contacts when an action is required in your environment so it's important these are up to date. If you're already a nominated administrator and would like to set up an additional administrator or make changes to any contacts, you can do so via the Contacts option in the UKCloud Portal. Subscribing to platform updates To provide you with the latest information on the availability and overall health of our platforms, we have set-up the UKCloud status page . This page shows the status of our services and connections, split by region and zone, and details of planned maintenance. To subscribe to updates, at the bottom of the page, click Subscribe , enter your email address then select the services you're interested in. You'll receive an email confirming your subscription to the status page; be sure to click Verify to ensure you'll receive updates on your selected services. For more information on finding the region and zone, see How to locate your virtual data centre on the UKCloud platform . If you're experiencing issues that aren't reflected on the status page, please contact us through the UKCloud Portal . Locating your VDCs UKCloud provides information about the location of a VDC in the VDC metadata. Using this metadata, you can locate a VDC by site, region and zone. Knowing where your VDCs are located can be useful for: Determining how resilient your applications are Determining how maintenance or an unplanned outage may affect your applications Providing additional information to help with support call resolution More detailed billing information per VM For more information, see How to locate your virtual data centre on the UKCloud platform . Renewing, adding and revoking SRA certificates Secure Remote Access (SRA) certificates enable you to securely connect to UKCloud's Elevated OFFICIAL security domain using NCSC-approved internet virtual private network (VPN) technologies and the walled garden architectural pattern. System administrators and mobile workers can securely access workloads running on Elevated OFFICIAL from locations that don't have alternative secure network connections such as PSN or HSCN. SRA certificates last for 12 months. You'll need to renew certificates no later than two weeks before the certificates expire to avoid any interruption to your service. To add additional certificates, raise a service request via the UKCloud Portal, selecting the Request Additional SRAS Certificate(s) option. To renew or revoke your certificate, raise a service request via the UKCloud Portal, selecting the Renew and/or Revoke SRAS Certificate option. For renewals, it's important you give us at least two weeks' notice to prevent a break in your service. If you have multiple certificates to renew or revoke, you can do this in a single service request by selecting the Renew and/or Revoke multiple SRAS Certificates option in the UKCloud Portal. Attach the Secure Remote Access bulk renewal/revoke form containing all the certificates. For more information, see the following articles: Secure Remote Access FAQs , Secure Remote Access Factsheet and Secure Remote Access Service Definition .

    "title": "UKCloud for OpenShift FAQs | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "UKCloud for OpenShift FAQs What is UKCloud for OpenShift? UKCloud for OpenShift is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution providing container management and orchestration powered by Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform to deliver a flexible, scalable cloud application platform. Unlike traditional managed PaaS offerings, it provides a modern application platform that accelerates end-to-end development, deployment and operation of digital applications, while raising overall application reliability and availability. Why deliver UKCloud for OpenShift as a cloud service? Although UKCloud for OpenShift is a simple, benefits-rich service to consume, it is a complex platform of inter-dependent servers and services, whose deployment, configuration and maintenance requires time and expertise. By offering this service, we take on all that complexity so that customers can immediately realise the value of UKCloud for OpenShift by simply consuming it. Is UKCloud for OpenShift a single-tenant or multi-tenant solution? UKCloud for OpenShift is built as a single-tenant platform on-top of UKCloud's secure, assured multi-tenant UKCloud for OpenStack IaaS platform, helping to deliver the benefits of single tenant isolation with the economics and flexibility of multi-tenant infrastructure. How is UKCloud for OpenShift billed? This service comprises of two main chargeable elements: Foundation Pack - provides the foundation OpenShift services to support the orchestration and management of the container runtime environments. Each customer environment requires only a single Foundation Pack Runtime Pack - Provides the footprint to host customer’s containerised applications and services. Customers can choose to mix and match their Runtime Packs, and Runtime Packs can be called off individually, however UKCloud strongly recommends the initial deployment of two or more Runtime Packs for production environments to provide resilience to your workloads in the event of the failure of a single Runtime Pack. Does UKCloud offer a free trial? Free trials are currently available for UKCloud for OpenShift. Please get in touch with your Account Manager to raise this request. Where is the service hosted? The service is delivered by UKCloud, a UK company, from two UK data centres separated by more than 100km, which are securely connected by high-bandwidth, low-latency dedicated connectivity. Does my data leave the UK? As the service is delivered from UK data centres by a UK company, your data doesn't leave the UK when at rest. How is UKCloud for OpenShift supported? UKCloud manages and supports UKCloud for OpenShift using our dedicated support team based in the UK. Support is available via helpdesk ticket or phone. What constitutes UKCloud for OpenShift? We monitor, maintain and support our controlled UKCloud for OpenShift infrastructure and services, including: UKCloud-controlled components, such as the virtual infrastructure, storage, power and physical firewalls and routers UKCloud-maintained OpenShift services (for example, router service, DEAs, health manager, cloud controller, Master Nodes, Worker Nodes, Routing Layer). Can I use UKCloud for OpenShift in the UKCloud Elevated (previously IL3) domain? UKCloud for OpenShift services are available in both our Assured (previously IL2) and Elevated (previously IL3) security domains. Is the service Pan Government Accredited? UKCloud's existing PGA continues to apply to the infrastructure underpinning our services. But since the move to the Government Security Classification Policy (GSCP), we can no longer seek PGA for newer services, such as UKCloud for OpenShift. We are now required to self-assert our services, with customers taking responsibility for assessing and selecting the most appropriate cloud services to meet their individual security requirements. We provide confidence that our OpenShift service still meets the highest level of information assurance, which is why we continue to have our platform independently tested and validated, and have the findings made available to customers and partners. This enables SIROs to make an informed decision about any service they choose to consume. Can I use UKCloud for OpenShift over closed networks such as PSN and HSCN? UKCloud for OpenShift is available on the PSN, HSCN and Janet networks. Does UKCloud offer any scheduled automated backups for UKCloud for OpenShift? As standard, localised component failures are tolerated within the infrastructure through elimination of single points of failure (including physical server failure or disk failure). Although UKCloud for OpenShift is designed to deploy and manage stateless apps (applications that can be killed and re-instantiated without risk of data loss), customers should ensure they maintain a master copy or backup copy of any persistent or dynamic data hosted on this service (such as MySQL DB) by using, for example, our Cloud Storage. What languages and frameworks are compatible with UKCloud for OpenShift? The service supports many popular development frameworks and languages such as: Java Spring Ruby Sinatra Node.js Python PHP GoLang Does UKCloud for OpenShift support any data services? Our OpenShift service provides popular open source data service packages deployable within the platform, all supported by the global open source community, including: MySQL, an open source relational database Postgres, a relational database based on PostgreSQL MongoDB, a scalable, open, document-based database RabbitMQ, for reliable, scalable and portable messaging for applications Note that these services are offered 'as is' with no management, support or availability commitment from UKCloud. We strongly suggest customers ensure they maintain a master copy or backup copy of any persistent or dynamic data hosted on this service (such as MySQL DB) by using, for example, a data service provided by a managed service provider on our UKCloud for VMware platform. How scalable is UKCloud for OpenShift? As a true cloud platform, UKCloud for OpenShift provides full elasticity and scalability. However, in order to protect the integrity of the platform and manage customer spend, soft limits on the number and size of application instances will be in place. These limits may be extended upon request. Which ports are open to the platform from the internet by default? By default, ports 80 and 443 are open for customer application traffic. Further ports can be opened on request either at time of deployment or post-deployment by raising a Service Request How do I add users? In order to add new users, you will need to raise a Service Request on the UKCloud Portal. What monitoring of the services is provided by default in a trial? By default, no specific monitoring service is integrated. However, we recommend external monitoring services such as Datadog or Coscale for production-grade OpenShift hosted applications. Alternatively, you can implement your own simple monitoring solution as described in How to monitor your OpenShift cluster . What monitoring of the services is provided on a billable service? By default, no specific monitoring service is integrated. It is our expectation that customers may want to use a third party or their own monitoring service to ensure cluster availability. There is a metrics service deployed into the cluster that provides utilisation stats of the cluster, and a wide range of metrics about both the cluster itself and the containers running within it can be extracted via the API to this service. Can I integrate external monitoring SaaS providers or my own monitoring agents to the service? We will happily work with customers during a trial period to integrate an external monitoring service that enables customer monitoring of the cluster and applications where infrastructure level configuration is required. How do I add extra capacity to my cluster? To add extra capacity to you cluster, you will need to raise a Service Request on the UKCloud Portal. We hope to provide portal integration to enable customers to be in control of this in the future. Can I have integrated container logging deployed with the platform? Yes, this can be requested at time of deployment, or added post-deployment. The services can be run on either the master nodes or the worker nodes in the cluster. By default, we would place them on the master nodes, but you may wish to change this placement to be more suitable for the specific cluster performance you desire. How much control do I have over the policies and configuration of the platform once it has been deployed? Customers have full administrative rights over the cluster configuration via the UI and API. Due to the varied nature of configurations that customers may want, such as the ability to merge projects and add service accounts for applications, we provide customers with the ability to self-serve on cluster administration from the beginning. Only infrastructure level tasks are controlled by UKCloud, such as adding users, scaling environments and patching. Can I run a privileged container? Yes, it is possible to run a privileged container. However, this is not recommended as it goes against security best practices. What is the underlying architecture of the starter deployment?

    "title": "How to set up Email and Collaboration on Android, Windows or Blackberry mobile devices | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to set up Email and Collaboration on Android, Windows or Blackberry mobile devices Overview UKCloud's Email and Collaboration as a Service includes the option of accessing emails, calendars and tasks via most smart phone devices. The underlying platform for this service is provided by Zimbra, and this guide contains an overview of mobility options for Zimbra Collaboration Suite (ZCS), as well as information on how to set up Zimbra Mobile for most smart phones on specific operating systems. Note The information supplied is a general guide for the majority of Android, Windows and Blackberry mobile devices; some devices may require an alternative or modified set up process. If you have an iPhone or iPad, see How to set up Email and Collaboration on an iPhone or iPad . Before you begin Android-based smart phones can natively synchronise email, contacts and calendars to Zimbra accounts. The two prerequisites to configure this are: The Zimbra email system used by your organisation or service provider is a paid Network Edition license (ask your administrator if you're not sure) Your administrator has enabled mobility on your account Assuming these two requirements are met, you can configure Zimbra just like you would a Microsoft Exchange account on the device (this is the name used for any ActiveSync‑based service). To complete the set up you will need to know the following: Email - This is your company email address Password - This is your Zimbra password (the same one used for the Zimbra Web Client) You may also need to know: Server - The Server FQDN or IP (best practice is to always use a valid FQDN, such as mail.example.com ) Security - If you want to use SSL Port - If your server does not use the default port (443) Installation and setup From your Android Home screen, tap the Applications button and go to the Settings icon. Under Accounts , tap Add account . Enter your Email address and Password to add an account, then tap Next Select Exchange from the type of account Note ZCS 7.x does not support auto-discovery.

You can optionally give this account a name. Click Done Configuring Zimbra Mobile for Smart Phones on Windows Mobile Devices Windows Mobile 6 and Windows Mobile 5 The following instructions are for configuring access to a ZCS account on a Windows Mobile 6 or Windows Mobile 5 device. Note Some users may experience configuration difficulty if using SSL with Windows Mobile 5. Windows Mobile 5 includes a limited number of root certificates and it may be necessary to install your server's signing CA's certificate on the device in order to use SSL. Zimbra Mobile must be enabled by a system administrator before a device can be configured. Select Start . Select ActiveSync . Choose to configure a new account : If no account is configured for ActiveSync, select the option to Set up your device to sync with it [the server]. If you're replacing a pre-existing account, select Menu and then select Configure Server In the Server address , enter the publicly accessible hostname of the server ( zimbra.example.com ). If the server requires SSL (that is, if the server's zimbraMailMode is redirect , https or mixed ), select the This server requires an encrypted (SSL) connection check box. Note Windows Mobile enforces strict verification of server certificates; if your Zimbra server has the default self-signed certificate, you will not be able to use Zimbra Mobile unless you import the root certificate from the server into the device. See the link to the SSLChainSaver utility below. Select Next . In the User name field, enter the username part of the email address ( bob of bob@example.com ). In the Password: field, enter the password of the user. In the Domain: field, enter the domain part of the email address ( example.com of bob\\@example.com ). Select the Save password check box. Select Next . Select the check boxes for any combination of Contacts , Calendar , and E-mail . As of ZCS 4.5.6, Tasks do not sync through Zimbra Mobile; selecting Tasks will cause the device to not sync properly with the server. Select Finish . The device is now configured. Select Sync to synchronize the selected items with the server. Windows Mobile 2003 The following instructions are for configuring access to a ZCS account on a Windows Mobile 2003 device. Connect the device to your Windows PC. Open ActiveSync if it is not already running. Go to the Tools > Configure Server Source . In the server source field, enter the FQDN of your Zimbra Server. Select the This server requires an encrypted (SSL) connection \" (if appropriate). In the username field, enter the full email address of the user. In the password field, enter the user's password. In the domain name field, enter the user's mail domain. Select the save password check box, if desired. The device is now configured. You must now import a certificate from the Zimbra Server to your mobile device in order for it to sync, or you'll get an error regarding an invalid certificate. Import the SSL certificate into the mobile device Go to the /opt/zimbra/ssl/zimbra/ca directory and copy your ca.pem file to a safe location. (Make sure this is the new certificate that you have created). Run the following command on the file you copied: $ openssl x509 -in ca.pem -inform PEM -out MyCertificatecrtcer -outform DER Copy the new MyCertificatecrt.cer file to your Windows Mobile device. Use your Windows Mobile device's File Manager to select the MyCertificate.crt.cer file. You should receive a message that the file was imported. Enable SSL in ActiveSync on your device. Zimbra Mobile Connector for BlackBerry Enterprise Server With the Zimbra Mobile Connector for BlackBerry Enterprise Server (ZCB), users can access the Zimbra Collaboration Suite (ZCS) server using their BlackBerry mobile devices. ZCB is a plug-in that enables synchronization of mail, address books (including GAL), calendars, and tasks between ZCS and a BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) for Microsoft Exchange, using MAPI. To install and run ZCB, you must have the most recently updated versions of servers, software, and equipment. Preparing for ZCB Installation Before installing ZCB, you must install MAPI/CDO, BES, and Outlook, along with the latest service packs. Following this, you must stop the BlackBerry Controller service. Installing CDO, Outlook and BES Use the appropriate software documentation to install the following: Install Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and the latest service packs. Install Microsoft Exchange Server MAPI/CDO 1.2.1 and the latest service packs. Install BlackBerry Enterprise Server for Microsoft Exchange 4.1 or BlackBerry Professional Software for Microsoft Exchange 4.1 Note During the BES installation, after you enter your SRP information, you may be prompted to enter profile creation information in a Microsoft Exchange Server dialog. Press OK to skip this step. Ignore any subsequent BES profile errors, such as an Invalid properties error. During the BES installation ignore warnings such as Exchange Server is not detected errors or could not verify the Microsoft Exchange permissions errors. Install Outlook 2007 with Service Pack 2. Before continuing, make sure that you have completed setting up MAPI/CDO, BES, and Outlook. Stop the BlackBerry Controller Service. The BlackBerry Controller service that controls the BlackBerryAgent process is a MAPI client. In order to install ZCB, all MAPI clients must be inactive. Stop the BlackBerry Controller service before continuing. Install ZCB The install program for ZCB is in the Windows Installer .msi format. To install the ZCB plug-in on BES. Open the .msi file to start the Installation Wizard, accept the license agreement and click Next . The ZCB is being installed. Click Next and then click Close to complete the installation. Provisioning accounts Before you can provision accounts, the following must be set up: Create a Zimbra administrator account for BES. For ZCS 5.0.19 or earlier you create a Zimbra administrator. For 6.0.0 or later, you create a global administrator account. (This is the same administrator account, but in 6.0 the name was changed to global administrator). Recreate the BlackBerry Manager and BlackBerry Server mail profiles. Following this, you can provision user accounts. After user accounts have been provisioned, restart your BlackBerry Controller service. Creating a BES Zimbra administrator account on ZCS Create a BES administrator account on the ZCS server in order to provision user accounts. Having a BES administrator account separate from the ZCS administrator account will allow you to specifically monitor BES use and statistics. Use the following steps to create this account: Log in to the Zimbra administration console. Go to Accounts . From the New menu, select Account . Complete the fields in the New Account dialog box. For 5.0.19 or earlier, select Administrator . For ZCS 6.0.0 or later, select Global Administrator . Note The user name and password will be used to create the BES manager and server mail profiles. Click Finish . Creating new BlackBerryManager and BlackBerryServer profiles Before you can provision BES accounts, you must delete and recreate the BES BlackBerryManager and BlackBerryServer mail profiles, using the account information from the BES Administrator account. Both of these profiles are configured identically. Use the following steps to create these two mail profiles. Important Before you can create the two mail profiles: The BlackBerry Controller service must be stopped. Because the process of installing ZCB may have caused the BlackBerry Controller service to restart, verify that it is not running before continuing. If your BES profiles will be opened with Outlook, when creating the mail profiles, select prompt for a profile to be used . Do not use the default. To create the BlackBerryManager profile Start the Mail Control Panel applet. Go to Control Panel > Mail > Show Profiles . Select the existing BlackBerryManager profile, and click Remove . Click Add to create a new profile. Enter BlackBerryManager in the New Profile dialog box, then click OK . In the Server Type dialog box, select Additional Server Types , then Click Next . In the Additional Server Types dialog box, from the Additional Server Types list, select Zimbra Collaboration Server . In the Zimbra Server Configuration Settings dialog box, on the Server Configuration tab, enter the following information: Server Name - This should be set to your Zimbra Server name and port number. This should be in the form of example.domain.com:7071 Note This must be the mailbox host name. It must be a direct access to the mailbox server, it cannot be the proxy server. ZCS proxy is not supported at this time. Select Secure Connection Email Address - This should be the name of the BES administrator account that you created on the ZCS server. This should be in the form of adminname@example.com Password - This should be the password of the BES administrator account that you created on the ZCS server Click OK . Create the BlackBerryServer profile Select the existing BlackBerryServer profile, and click Remove . Click Add to create a new profile. In the New Profile dialog box, enter BlackBerryServer then click OK . In the Server Type dialog box, select Additional Server Types then click Next . In the Additional Server Types dialog box, from the Additional Server Types list, select Zimbra Collaboration Server . In the Zimbra Server Configuration Settings dialog box, on the Server Configuration tab, enter the following information: Server Name - This should be set to your Zimbra Server name and port number. This should be in the form of example.domain.com:7071 . Select Secure Connection . Email Address - This should be the name of the BES administrator account that you created on the ZCS server. This should be in the form of adminname@example.com . Password - This should be the password of the BES administrator account that you created on the ZCS server. Click OK . Restart your BlackBerry Controller service. When your BlackBerry Controller service restarts, BES begins to synchronize the Global Address List (GAL). Provisioning accounts with the BES Manager Once the GAL has finished syncing, use BES Manager to provision user accounts and create the Activation Password. Note It may take several minutes before BES is able to synchronize the GAL. Larger GALs may take longer to synchronize. You may be unable to provision users until the GAL has been fully synchronized. ZCB SMB only supports over the air (OTA) activation, so you must set an activation password. For more information on provisioning accounts using the BES Manager, refer to your BES documentation. Multi-agent configuration When a single instance of BES used with the Zimbra Collaboration Suite Connector is expected to support more than 100 users, the Zimbra multi-agent configuration (MAC) for BES must be used. In the multi-agent configuration, processing of users provisioned on BES is distributed among multiple static agents. Activating devices When user accounts are provisioned in BES, ZCB syncs with the ZCS server to build a local cache of each user's data. Once this synchronization is complete, users can activate their devices over the air (OTA). OTA activation is performed through the Enterprise Activation application on users' devices. To activate a device, users use the email address that was provisioned for them in BES and the enterprise activation password. Important If users reprovision their BlackBerry mobile device, they must first wipe the device before activating their accounts.

    "keywords": "How to access syslog data for your advanced gateway Overview Your NSX edge is globally configured to send syslog messages to a specific IP address ( 100.127.255.250 ). By configuring a new network or IP address within your virtual data centre (VDC) and deploying a collector with the syslog IP address, you can access your NSX edge syslog data. You can then use this data to check: Allowed and denied network traffic Load balancer statistics Load balancer health This guide explains the network configuration required to provision a syslog collector within your VDC to receive syslog information direct from your NSX gateway. Collecting syslog data for a single NSX edge The simplest scenario is to gather syslog data from a single NSX edge into one collector. To do this you need to create a routable location for the syslog IP address, by either: Adding the syslog IP address to an existing network interface card (NIC) on a routed subnet Configuring a new routed network Adding the syslog IP address to an existing NIC Add the syslog IP address to a subnet on the routed network. For example, if your existing monitoring server has a NIC on eth0 (for example, 10.0.1.10 ), on routed VDC network 10.0.1.0/24 , you'd add the syslog IP address to eth0 . Add a route on the NSX ddge that routes the syslog IP address via the subnet. For example, route 100.127.255.250 MASK 255.255.255.255 via 10.0.1.10 . Configure the software on your existing monitoring server to capture data from the IP address of the NSX edge. Note The steps to achieve this depend on your operating system and chosen syslog server. Configuring a new routed network Create a new routed network with the following details: Org Network Name: Customer defined Gateway: 100.127.255.249 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.248 DNS: Customer defined Static IP Pool: 100.127.255.250-100.127.255.254 You can find more detailed steps for creating a routed network in How to create a routed VDC network . Deploy a new syslog server connected to the new routed network with a static address of 100.127.255.250 and install and configure the syslog server's NSX edge. Note The steps to achieve this depend on your operating system and chosen syslog server. Collecting syslog data for multiple NSX edges If you have multiple NSX edges under a single NFT, you can gather the data from all those edges into the same syslog collector. Set up a single syslog collector for one of your NSX edges as described in the previous section. Note We'll refer to this NSX edge as the syslog edge and all the other NSX edges as source edges . Confirm that you can see the local syslog traffic from the local syslog edge. Create a firewall rule on the syslog edge to allow syslog traffic from the source edges' TRANSIT IPs ( 172.26. x . x in Assured or 172.26. LOWER OCTET . x in Elevated) through to the syslog server IP. You can create individual rules using the following suggestions: SOURCE TRANSIT IP :Any to 100.127.255.250 on UDP Any:Any to 100.127.255.250:514 on UDP NFT TRANSIT CIDR/SUBNET :Any to 100.127.255.250:514 on UDP On each of the source edges, create a static route to direct traffic to the syslog edge. Use the following settings: Applied On: nft_network Name: Syslog traffic (or any other name you prefer) Network: 100.127.255.248/29 Next Hop IP: The TRANSIT IP address of the syslog edge Syslog packets from each source edge will now be forwarded to the syslog edge, with the source of the syslog traffic being the TRANSIT IP of the source edge. Perform a packet capture on the syslog collector to confirm it's receiving packets from the source edges. Note You may have to enable or disable logging on firewall rules to trigger syslog traffic. When you've confirmed that your syslog collector is receiving the syslog data, configure your syslog server to capture packets from the new syslog source. Enabling logging After setting up your syslog collector, you need to make sure that your NSX edge sends network traffic to the log. In vCloud Director, select the Administration tab. Double-click the VDC to which the NSX edge belongs. Select the Edge Gateways tab. Select the Edge Settings tab. Click Edit Syslog Server . In the Edit Syslog Server dialog box, in the Syslog Server field, enter the IP address of your syslog server then click Keep . Currently, you cannot setup logging for firewall rules for NSX edges via the advanced gateway GUI. To setup logging for firewall rules, you must either use the API or raise a service request detailing the firewall rules for which you want to enable logging so that we can action it on your behalf. For more information about using the API to amend firewall rules, see the vCloud Director API for NSX Programming Guide Note Any firewall rules that were set up to send logs before conversion to an advanced gateway will continue to send logs. However if you want to disable logging for those firewall rules, you must use the API or raise a service request. Select the Load Balancer tab. On the Global Configuration page, select the Enable Logging toggle . From the Log Level list, select the logging level. When you're done, click Save changes . You can find more detailed steps for editing load balancer settings in How to configure a load balancer .

    "keywords": "How to access Red Hat update servers Overview UKCloud has implemented a Red Hat Update Infrastructure (RHUI) to provide automatic updates to our Red Hat customers in the Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL security domains. The benefits over the existing system are the reliable availability of patch updates and Red Hat approved OS templates. Before you attempt to establish a connection to RHUI, you need to make sure your virtual machines (VMs) can communicate with the RHUI which exists outside of your cloud organisation. This may involve editing the NAT and firewall settings within your edge gateway to allow traffic to traverse into your virtual data centre (VDC). For how to do this, see the articles for creating NAT and firewall rules. New Red Hat VM templates Certain Red Hat templates within the public catalog within vCloud Director are automatically configured to receive updates from UKCloud's RHUI. The templates are: RHEL6.6 - UKCloud-RHEL6.6-x86_64-RHUI-Template RHEL7.1 - UKCloud-RHEL7.1-x86_64-RHUI-Template These templates have the following properties: You can find the default root password in the VM Properties Description field (you can set the password using Guest Customization) Red Hat Update Infrastructure enabled for standard packages VMware Tools / Guest Customization enabled 32GB disk space / 1 x vCPU / 2GB ram (default, adjust as required) You can adjust the VM properties as required and you'll be billed as per the standard VM sizes as described in the UKCloud for VMware Service Definition. You will not be billed on additional storage until you reach the 60GiB of provisioned disk space.

    "title": "How to access CentOS Update servers | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to access CentOS Update servers Overview Each of the two security domains within the UKCloud cloud presents its own challenges regarding licensing CentOS machines. This document explains how to access the CentOS repository servers to receive updates. Before you attempt to establish a connection to the CentOS repo servers, you need to make sure your VMs can communicate with the CentOS server which exists outside of your cloud organisation. This may involve editing your NAT and firewall settings within your edge gateway to allow traffic to traverse into your virtual data centre (VDC). For how to do this, see the How to create NAT rules and How to create firewall rules . Assured OFFICIAL platform UKCloud's Assured OFFICIAL security domain is internet facing, so you need to configure your VM to connect to the internet, and use a standard update tool, such as Spacewalk RHN, to get updates for CentOS. Elevated OFFICIAL platform Our Elevated OFFICIAL security domain doesn't natively connect to the internet, and the PSN Protected network doesn't have any CentOS repo servers. To receive CentOS updates, you can use UKCloud-managed repository servers or a Walled Garden. Both options are described below. Option 1. UKCloud-managed repository servers We provide repositories for CentOS 6 on our Elevated OFFICIAL security domain. To access them: Create a file called il3-repos.repo in /etc/yum.repos.d , and populate it with the following: ``` [base] name=UKCloud CentOS Repository - Base baseurl=http://<elevated-public-ip-address>/centos/6.5/os/x86_64 gpgcheck=1 gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-6 [updates] name=UKCloud CentOS Repository - Updates baseurl=http://<elevated-public-ip-address>/centos/centos-updates gpgcheck=1 gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-6 [extras] name=UKCloud CentOS Repository - Extras baseurl=http://<elevated-public-ip-address>/centos/centos-extras gpgcheck=1 gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-6 ``` Or use the following command to download the repo file directly from the server: ``` wget -P /etc/yum.repos.d http://<elevated-public-ip-address>/repos/ukcloud_centos6.repo ``` In the above string, replace elevated-public-ip-address with the Elevated OFFICIAL public IP addresses. If you're not sure what this is, contact UKCloud Support. Remove all other *.repo files in this directory. Option 2. Walled Garden Choose this option only if you want full control of CentOS updates and are already thinking of deploying a Walled Garden. This option involves pulling updates into the Assured security domain, then using UKCloud's Walled Garden to move them to the Elevated security domain. It's a much more complex solution than using UKCloud-managed repository servers, and you have sole responsibility for deploying and managing it.

    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware Overview If you're new to UKCloud, you'll probably have received a link to this guide as part of your welcome email. It will help you to get started using UKCloud for VMware. The Getting Started Guide provides an overview of UKCloud for VMware and gives you basic information about how to log in and set up your environment. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have access to the UKCloud Portal and vCloud Director. To build compute services and virtual data centres (VDCs) you must be a vCloud Director administrator. Before you begin You should have received your UKCloud Portal login credentials from your Customer Success Manager (CSM). We recommend that you use the Mozilla Firefox ESR 32-bit browser as this is supported by both the UKCloud Portal and by the Web Console for the version of vCloud Director used by UKCloud for VMware. More information! Browser requirements for services on the UKCloud Platform Introductions to UKCloud for VMware We understand that each enterprise application has its own set of technical and service requirements that must be addressed on an individual basis. UKCloud for VMware is highly configurable, and gives you the flexibility to use different service levels, VM sizes, security domains, connectivity and data protection options. You can build completely tailored solutions by mixing and matching service options. The choice doesn't lock you to one service or size and you can always change it later. Services within UKCloud belong to an account, which in turn belongs to a company. A company can own multiple accounts. You can use accounts to create separate environments for different projects or, in the case of UKCloud partners, to create separate environments for different customers. Within an account you can have multiple UKCloud services, one of which could be UKCloud for VMware. You can have multiple instances of a service within an account. Logging in to the UKCloud Portal The first thing you need to do to get started with UKCloud for VMware is to log in to the UKCloud Portal. Go to the appropriate URL, depending on the security domain in which your service is located: Assured OFFICIAL: https://portal.ukcloud.com Elevated OFFICIAL: Contact your Portal administrator or Customer Success Manager (CSM) On the Log in page, enter your credentials and click Sign in . Tip If you've forgotten your password, click the Forgotten password? link to request a password reset. If this is the first time you've logged in, use the temporary password you were given by your Portal administrator or CSM. You'll be prompted to change this temporary password. If your Portal administrator has enabled memorable word authentication, you'll be prompted to enter three randomly‑selected letters from your memorable word. (If this is the first time you've logged in, you'll be prompted to create a memorable word.) If your Portal administrator has enabled Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), you'll be prompted to enter a six digit code. Use your 2FA app to generate the code and enter it here. (If this is the first time you've logged in, you'll be prompted to set up 2FA.) Note If you incorrectly enter your password three times, you'll be prompted to enter a captcha code until you successfully log in. If you incorrectly enter the captcha code or your password another three times, a seventh unsuccessful login attempt will result in your account being locked. You'll need to contact your Portal administrator to unlock your account. For more information about the UKCloud Portal and all the functionality it provides, see the Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal . Creating your UKCloud for VMware estate When you first access UKCloud for VMware, you'll need to create a compute service (sometimes called a vOrg) to act as a top-level container for your cloud resources. As your estate grows, you can add more compute services to logically organise your resources. Within your compute service, you create VDCs to contain your VMs. VMs in the same VDC share workload characteristics and have access to the same resources, such as networking infrastructure, storage and external connectivity. We recommend that you organise related VMs within vApps to make your applications easier to manage. For example, you can start all the VMs within a vApp with a single operation, rather than having to start up each VM separately. vApps are also useful to help maintain crash‑consistency within an application in the event of a disaster. Building a compute service If you have the appropriate permissions, you can use the Portal to create a compute service in your account, without having to raise a support ticket. In the UKCloud Portal, select the account in which you want to create the compute service. In the navigation panel, expand Tools and then select Create Compute Service . On the Build Compute Service page, from the Zone radio buttons, select the zone in which you want to create the new compute service. Note In the Portal, you can create compute services only in zones in regions 5 and 6. Enter a Compute Service Name . Tip The name can be up to 32 characters long and can include any character except +. Click Build . The Build Compute Service Status page displays information about the compute service you're building and lets you know how the build is progressing. Tip You can stay on this page until the build is finished, or you can leave this page and check the status of the build later by going to the VMware Cloud Build History report. When the build is complete, the page displays either a success or fail message. If the build is successful, you can start building VDCs in your compute service (see Building a virtual data centre ). If the build is unsuccessful, raise a support ticket (quoting the Build ID ) to resolve any issues. Building a virtual data centre After creating your compute service, the next step is to create one or more VDCs. Note You can build VDCs in any of your compute services in regions 5 and 6, including those created by support tickets or the Portal API, not just those you created using the Portal. In the Portal navigation panel, expand VMware Cloud and then select the compute service in which you want to create the VDC. Note To create a VDC using the Portal, the compute service must be in region 5 or 6. From the Actions menu, select Build VDC . Note If this option is greyed out, either you do not have the appropriate permissions or your compute service is not in region 5 or 6. On the Build VDC page, from the VM Type radio buttons, select the option that describes the characteristics of the workload of the VDC: ESSENTIAL ---For lower priority workloads, such as temporary applications, data processing or system modelling tasks. VMs in the VDC can have contended compute resource allocation (CPU/RAM) and automated rebalancing is enabled to ensure the workload receives the requested performance. POWER ---For key workloads that are resource intensive, such as web and application workloads, mid-sized databases and caching services. VMs in the VDC have an uncontended compute resource allocation and automated rebalancing is enabled to pre-emptively optimise performance and availability. PRIORITY ---For critical workloads that handle important business processes that benefit from a steady state of operation. VMs in the VDC have an uncontended compute resource allocation and automated rebalancing is configured to reduce workload movement around the platform. Enter a VDC Name . Tip The name can be up to 32 characters long and can include any character except +. Click Build . The VDC Build Status page displays information about the VDC you're building and lets you know how the build is progressing. Tip You can stay on this page until the build is finished, or you can leave this page and check the status of the build later by going to the VMware Cloud Build History report. When the build is complete, the page displays either a success or fail message. If the build is successful, you can start building VMs. To provide external access to the VDC, you'll need to create an edge gateway (see How to build an edge gateway using the UKCloud Portal ). If the build is unsuccessful, raise a support ticket (quoting the Build ID ) to resolve any issues. Logging in to vCloud Director After you've created your compute service and VDC, you can start to build up your applications. To do this, you must log in to vCloud Director, which you can access from the UKCloud Portal. In the Portal navigation panel expand VMware Cloud then select your compute service. On the vCloud Director tab, for additional security, re-enter your UKCloud Portal password, then click Confirm . vCloud Director launches in your browser window. What you see depends on the version of vCloud Director available in your environment. vCloud Director 8.20 Home page Note If this is the first time you've opened vCloud Director, you may be requested to download the vCloud Director Web Console plugin. Tip If you encounter any issues, make sure you're using the Firefox ESR 32-bit browser.

    "title": "Getting Started Guide for Journaling Protection | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for Journaling Protection Overview Journaling Protection is a powerful, self-service replication and recovery tool that can help you improve your organisational resilience. By adopting UKCloud's Journaling Protection solution, you can protect your UKCloud for VMware applications by replicating them to another UKCloud for VMware‑enabled zone. This ensures that you can meet your disaster recovery requirements --- including any aggressive recovery point or recovery time objectives. Our Journaling Protection solution is powered by Zerto, a leading provider of disaster recovery software for the cloud. This guide covers the tasks you need to perform to get Journaling Protection up and running in your environment. Intended audience This guide is intended for any user who needs to create and manage Journaling Protection for UKCloud for VMware. To complete the steps in this guide you need to have access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal. Introduction to Journaling Protection You can protect your VMs by adding Journaling Protection to the vApp that contains those VMs. When you add Journaling Protection to a vApp, if a VM in that vApp is compromised, for example by a virus attack or bad software update, you can quickly recover the VM to a point in time before that attack or update took place. You enable Journaling Protection by adding the vApp to a virtual protection group (VPG). Each VM in the protected vApp is synchronised to the recovery site and a journal is created. After this initial synchronisation, each subsequent write operation to the VM is processed as normal on the source site and a copy is asynchronously sent to the recovery site and written to the journal. Each journal entry exists in the journal for a specified number of days (the journal history). When the journal history is reached, as new journal entries are created, older entries are written to the recovery VM's virtual disks. Every few seconds, a checkpoint is written to every journal for each VM in the VPG to ensure crash-consistency between the VMs. If you need to recover a VM, you select a checkpoint to recover to. For example, in the case of a virus, you could recover to a checkpoint from before the attack. During recovery, the vApp and its VMs are created on the recovery site and the recovery disks for each VM are attached to the recovered VM. Information in the journal is then promoted to the VM to bring it up to the date and time of the selected checkpoint. Two terms you may hear in connection with Journaling Protection are recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO). The RPO indicates the amount of data you can afford to lose in the event of an outage. For example, if your application data changes fairly infrequently, your RPO can be higher as the data remains fairly static. However, if your application data is constantly changing, you'll need your RPO to be smaller to avoid significant loss of data in the event of an outage. The RTO is the amount of time you can tolerate your application being unavailable in the event of an outage. For example, if your application provides critical functionality, you'll need to bring it back online very quickly. However, for a less critical application, you may be able to tolerate a longer outage. Because of the use of regular checkpoints (every few seconds), our Zerto‑powered Journaling Protection option provides a minimal RPO. The ability to use recovered VMs even before all the journal data has been promoted provides a good RTO as well. Before you begin When you request Journaling Protection for your VMs, UKCloud provides you with: A ZORG ID to identify your environment within Zerto Access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal (ZSSP), where you can create and manage your VPGs You should consider the following: Journaling Protection is provided on a vApp basis (not for individual VMs). When designing your application, you should use vApps to group related VMs together to ensure crash consistency between VMs in the event of a failover. VMs must be powered on to be synchronised. The operating system used by the protected VMs must also be supported in the recovery site. Our Journaling Protection service option captures every action. When a VM is deleted from your vApp, the associated journal is also deleted. If you want to keep historic records of VMs that are no longer running on the platform, consider UKCloud's Snapshot Protection service option. We provide a single default service profile. The details of this are available in the Journaling Protection Service Scope . We do not currently provide the option for you to create custom profiles. Getting Journaling Protection up and running To get Journaling Protection up and running for your VMs, follow the steps below: Create a recovery VDC Configure networking on the recovery site Create a virtual protection group Perform a test failover Create a recovery VDC To recover your VMs to a different UKCloud site, you must have a VDC in the intended recovery site. If you already have a compute service in the recovery site, you can use an existing VDC or you can create a new one using: The UKCloud Portal (for more information see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware ) The UKCloud Portal API (for more information see the How to use the UKCloud Portal API ) If you don't already have a compute service in the recovery site or you'd prefer UKCloud to create the VDC for you, you can request this as part of your Journaling Protection Service Request. Configure networking on the recovery site You must configure any internally and externally routed networks in your recovery site to duplicate those in the source site. You must also configure the edge gateway with the same firewall, NAT and other rules. You'll create the mapping between these networks when you create your VPG (see How to create a virtual protection group ). In the event of a failover, external access to the recovery site will be via a different IP address. You'll need to account for any required DNS changes and external connectivity configuration (such as VPNs), to ensure continued external access. Utilising UKCloud's VMware cloud, you can configure this in advance. Alternatively, you can use load balancing technologies to manage a seamless switch between environments. You do not need to configure vApp networks in advance as they will be replicated within the VPG. Create a virtual protection group A virtual protection group (VPG) is a collection of VMs that are grouped together for protection purposes. The UKCloud Journaling Protection service option protects VMs on a vApp basis. When you create a VPG, you specify the vApp to protect and all the VMs in that vApp are protected. For example, in a standard three-tier application, you will likely have three VMs: one for your application, one for the database and one for the web server. As best practice, you should create these three related VMs in a single vApp, which you can then add to a VPG so that all the VMs are replicated (and recovered) together. For more information, see How to create a virtual protection group . Perform a test failover After you create your VPG, we recommend that you perform a test failover to confirm that your VMs will be recovered correctly in the event of a live failover. You should also run test failovers periodically to ensure that your VMs can still be recovered successfully. For more information, see How to perform a failover . Next steps You have now performed all the steps needed to set up Journaling Protection for your VMs. If you experience a disaster, such as a virus attack, you can perform a live failover to recover your VMs to a specific point in time before the disaster occurred and continue operation as usual. For more information, see How to perform a failover . Glossary This glossary provides definitions of terms specific to Journaling Protection. failover When an application switches to an alternative environment in order to ensure continued operation. journal A repository of write operations performed on a protected VM after the initial synchronisation. source site The UKCloud site where your live VMs are located. recovery point objective (RPO) The amount of data you can afford to lose in the event of an outage. recovery site The UKCloud site to which your VMs are replicated for protection.

    "keywords": "Creating load-balancing services on UKCloud for OpenStack Overview Although OpenStack's Neutron project does support load-balancing natively, our testing has shown that this is not a highly available solution which could result in the loss of traffic flow to a project in the event of a host failure, this view has been echoed by many other OpenStack vendors. In order to mitigate against this scenario, we have created the following article, which enables you to easily deploy our load-balancing solution within your OpenStack projects. Benefits of this solution include: Highly Available implementation of an OpenStack load-balancing solution Advanced load-balancing services provided by HAProxy (for example, SSL support, session stickiness) Fully scripted repeatable deployment (HEAT template available on the UKCloud Knowledge Centre alongside this article) Caveats This solution utilises HAProxy and keepalived, both of which are complicated software products. This guide will help you set up UKCloud for OpenStack to enable you to deploy a load-balancing solution based on keepalived and haProxy, but additional tuning and configuration may be required depending on your intended setup. Please take a moment to have a read through the documentation for both the keepalived project - http://www.keepalived.org/documentation.html and the HAProxy project - http://www.haproxy.org . Prerequisites This guide assumes that you have the following already configured in your environment: A router connected to the internet external network. A jump server with required security groups to allow you to SSH to that server and to SSH inside your environment. At least two servers inside your environment running a web server to test the HAProxy configuration against. The Ubuntu 16.04 amd64 image (id: b8617599-495f-4d00-abf9-57b431caeb4c ) has been used throughout this document. Implementation steps Create the network in which your front edge load balancers sit. Command: neutron net-create <network-name> Example: neutron net-create FrontEdge Result: Create the subnet in which your load-balancers will be placed (we recommend creating a /28 , as four addresses will be used internally by OpenStack). Command: neutron subnet-create --name <subnetName> <networkName> <cidr> Example: neutron subnet-create --name FrontEdge FrontEdge 192.168.0.0/28 Result: Attach your internet router to the newly created network. Locate your router. Command: neutron router-list Result: Add the Interface to the router. Command: neutron router-interface-add <RouterName> <NetworkName> Example: neutron router-interface-add R1 FrontEdge Result: Create a port to be used as the VIP addresses. Command: neutron port-create --fixed-ip subnet_id=<subnetName>,ip_address=<vipIP> <NetworkName> Example: neutron port-create --fixed-ip subnet_id=FrontEdge,ip_address=192.168.0.5 FrontEdge Result: Make a note of the ID and the IP you set as you will need this information later. Associate Floating IP with newly created VIP port. Get a new floating IP. Command: neutron floatingip-create <floatingIPPoolName> Example: neutron floatingip-create internet Result: Make a note of the ID you will need it in the next step. Associate the floating IP to VIP port-create. Command: neutron floatingip-associate <floatingIPID> <portID> Example: neutron floatingip-associate 247b7001-f145-4a61-8988-7bdf61915e4f6653ae36-6a30-4eed-8c5a-da567c92610d Result: Create and boot the two load-balancer instances. Get a list of availability zones to ensure resilience of the LB pair. Command: nova availability-zone-list Result: Make a note of available zones, as you'll want to boot one server into one zone and the other into the other. Get available flavours. Command: nova flavor-list Result: Make a note of the ID of the flavour you want to use. Get available images. Command: glance image-list Result: Make a note of the ID of the image you want to boot. Boot the first server. Command: nova boot --flavor <flavorID> --image <imageID> --key-name <keyName> --availability-zone <availabilityZone> --nic net-name=<networkName>,v4-fixed-ip=<fixedIP> <name> Example: nova boot --flavor 43746228-0c64-4e33-b39d-c3f91bedb7cc --image b8617599-495f-4d00-abf9-57b431caeb4c --key-name user-laptop --availability-zone 0000c-1 --nic net-name=FrontEdge,v4-fixed-ip=192.168.0.6 LB1-node1 Result: Boot the second server, remembering to change the availability zone and the IP address of the server. Command: nova boot --flavor <flavorID> --image <imageID> --key-name <key-name> --availability-zone <availability-zone> --nic net-name=<networkName>,v4-fixed-ip=<fixedIP> <name> Example: nova boot --flavor 43746228-0c64-4e33-b39d-c3f91bedb7cc --image b8617599-495f-4d00-abf9-57b431caeb4c --key-name user-laptop --availability-zone 0000c-2 --nic net-name=FrontEdge,v4-fixed-ip=192.168.0.7 LB1-node2 Result: Update ports to allow traffic to be sent via VIP IP. Get the port IDs that need updating. Command: neutron port-list network-id <network-id> Example: neutron port-list --network-id e1909abc-9ce6-45e7-8a3a-9c53d7c4af2b Result: You need to locate the ports that are attached to your load-balancer instances. Once you've located them, note down the IDs as you'll need them in the next steps. Update the first port to allow traffic to pass on VIP IP. Command: neutron update-port <portID> --allowed_address_pairs list=true type=dict ip_address=<VIPIP> Example: neutron port-update cbe044c6-8501-4e9f-9b68-7bedc45cd0ee -allowed_address_pairs list=true type=dict ip_address=192.168.0.5 Result: Update the second port to allow traffic to pass on VIP IP. Command: neutron update-port <portID> --allowed_address_pairs list=true type=dict ip_address=<VIPIP> Example: neutron port-update 4dd06a59-6c18-4996-b80f-7c1577a1595e -allowed_address_pairs list=true type=dict ip_address=192.168.0.5 Result: Patch and install keepalived and HAProxy. SSH to your jump server, and then through to the first load-balancer. Run a system update. sudo apt-get update -y sudo apt-get upgrade -y Install keepalived and HAProxy. sudo apt-get install haproxy keepalived -y Configure keepalived. Copy example configuration to keepalive config directory. sudo cp /usr/share/doc/keepalived/samples/keepalived.conf.vrrp /etc/keepalived/keepalivd.conf Delete lines 36 through 79 in /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf . Set the email address you want to receive notifications in the Notification_email section. Set the notification_email_from email addresses. Set the SMTP server IP. Set the interface name to be the name of the first network interface on the server (not loopback). Set the Router_ID to a description of the router's function. Set the auth_pass to a new secure password (avoid special characters). Remove all items inside the virtual_ipaddress section. Add the VIP IP from earlier to the virtual_ipaddress section (This is the internal IP NOT the floating IP). Save and exit the file. Take a copy of the file, and transfer it to the second load balancer machine. Enable non-local IP binding on the first load balancer. Add net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1 to /etc/sysctl.conf Add net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind = 1 to /etc/sysctl.conf sudo sysctl -p Configure the second load balancer. Place a copy of the first load balancer's keepalived.conf into /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf . Edit /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf and make the following changes Change state to BACKUP Change priority to 90 Save and exit the file Enable non-local IP binding on the second server. Add net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1 to /etc/sysctl.conf sudo sysctl -p Start keepalived on first load balancer. sudo service keepalived start Start keepalived on the second load balancer. sudo service keepalived start Check to ensure that the VIP IP has come up on the first load balancer. ip add -4 -o a You should see the VIP showing up in the resulting list. Fail the first load balancer and ensure that the VIP moves to the second load balancer. Configure HAProxy on the first load balancer by adding a frontend and backend Edit /etc/haproxy/haproxy.conf Add the following section to the bottom of the file: frontend localnodes bind <VIPIP>:80 mode http default_backend nodes Add the following section below the frontend section: backend nodes mode http balance roundrobin option forwardfor server <Name> <ServerIP>:<serverPort> check server <Name> <ServerIP>:<serverPort> check Copy the changes from the first load balancer to the second load balancer. On both load balancers issue a reload command to hot restart HAProxy and load in the new changes. sudo service haproxy reload Set up security groups required for your application, and apply them to the load-balancer servers. You will also need to apply security groups to your backend servers to allow the required traffic to pass from the load-balancer nodes to the required ports on the back-end servers. Testing - Once HAProxy has reloaded on both servers, you should be able to connect to your floating IP address and the content hosted on your web servers should now be visible. Try disabling keepalived on the first load-balancer after a few seconds traffic should flow through to the second load-balancer and your content should still be available. Post installation Depending on the amount of traffic you expect to see, you may need to make additional tuning changes to your load balancer systems. Usually these changes take the form of increasing the number of available ephemeral ports, and the enablement of tcp_tw_reuse . Please do careful research on these settings before making changes. We recommend making these changes on a non-live system and testing before applying these changes to a production system. You may also wish to investigate keepalived ability to monitor applications on the local system and force a fail over if an application crashes. For example, keepalived can be made to monitor HAProxy and to fail over if HAProxy stops or fails. Instructions on how to do this can be found in the keepalived documentation. First free load balancer To meet the UKCloud for OpenStack G-Cloud Service Definition commitment of one free load balancer per project, we will credit the first two instances in a project which match the following criteria: Region Flavor ID Image ID Instance name prefix COR00005 43746228-0c64-4e33-b39d-c3f91bedb7cc b8617599-495f-4d00-abf9-57b431caeb4c LB1- Note UKCloud has the right to remove this free solution with 30 days notice once the default OpenStack LBaaS service has been made available.

    "title": "Security best practices for UKCloud for Openshift | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Security best practices for UKCloud for OpenShift Overview As is the nature of technology, any cloud-based service is vulnerable to exploits from both hackers and insiders just the same as traditional environments. Such risks include data stealing, crypto-mining, ransomware and service disruption to name a few. Although the nature of running container-based workloads reduces the threat to your underlying infrastructure, that threat is not completely eliminated and you should still take care when designing, developing and deploying your container-based workloads to minimise the risks to those deployments in UKCloud for OpenShift. This article sets out some best practices to follow to minimise the attack vector to a UKCloud for OpenShift cluster and its workloads. Intended audience This article is intended for anyone who is using UKCloud for OpenShift. It highlights some of the best practices to keep OpenShift workloads secure. Role Based Access Control Within OpenShift, you can grant various levels of access to users, which can be cluster-wide or limited to a particular OpenShift object. You can associate users and groups with multiple roles at the same time. You can view a pre-defined list of cluster roles and local roles here . Users with the cluster-admin default cluster role bound cluster-wide can perform any action on any resource. Users with the admin default cluster role bound locally can manage roles and bindings within a project. It is good practice to follow the principle of least privilege with OpenShift access. For information about creating new OpenShift users, see How to create new UKCloud for OpenShift users in the UKCloud Portal . This article also explains how to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) when logging in to OpenShift. Users are also encouraged to change their passwords regularly, which is possible to do from the UKCloud Portal. You should ensure that OpenShift account credentials are not shared between multiple users. Instead, you should create individual user accounts for each user with the correct role binding. It is also the responsibility of each individual user to ensure the physical security of the terminal from which they access OpenShift. You should also apply the principle of least privilege to your containers' workloads. This means you should run your workloads as a user with just enough permissions to run the workload within your containers, particularly avoiding running privileged containers if this can be avoided. If however a workload does require to be run as a privileged container, then you should ensure that you set the correct security context constraint (SCC) to run that container. You can read more about setting the correct SCC here . Containers that try to run as priviledged without the relevant SCC set will fail to run. Service accounts You should use service accounts for all API access, which should be accomplished by an automated process; never use a regular user's credentials. Usually a service account's username is the same as the project it is created for, followed by its name: system:serviceaccount:<project>:<name> For example: system:serviceaccount:continuous-integration:jenkins You can read more about service accounts here . Creating and deploying vulnerable container images Just like traditional software packages, containers also run software, even if they are running that software within a self contained environment of a container. These containers can be built and run using vulnerable software packages/libraries. It is therefore considered good practice to do the following to ensure that you are not introducing vulnerable containers into your clusters: Only use base images from trusted sources, for example, Red Hat's container registry. Red Hat's containers on Red Hat's container registry are scanned for vulnerabilities and given a security rating. Docker Hub also provides some certified containers that are built using best practices, tested and validated against the Docker Enterprise Edition platform and APIs, pass Dockers security requirements, and are collaboratively supported by Docker and the company responsible for the container. You can also build base containers from scratch using only the software packages you need for your workload. However, building containers from scratch and using just enough of the software packages you need to run for your workload does not guarantee that your base image is going to be free of all possible vulnerabilities as it is possible that some of those software packages could contain vulnerabilities. Scan your containers with container vulnerability scanning software as part of your build or deployment process. There are several tools available to scan containers. These tools give you a security rating on your final container once it's been created from a secure base container. There are a number of tools available to do this, the following is a small sample we're aware of: OpenSCAP-docker Black Duck Hub JFrog Xray Twistlock Image-inspector Clair Secrets Sensitive information, such as passwords, SSH keys, tokens and certificates, are examples of information that could be considered secret. As such secrets should never be stored in any place in plain text readable format (for example, in source code, GitHub repositories, and so on). It is imperative that when secrets are required in OpenShift, they are set up as OpenShift Secrets. This allows the secrets to be encrypted within OpenShift and accessed only by the relevant containers when they are needed. However there are limits to the current OpenShift secrets ability: the secrets are encoded in base64 encryption, which can be easily decrypted, and stored secrets can be accessible from any container on the same node. You could use a popular solution like Hashicorps Vault software for secret storage. Limiting resources You should always set up containers with resource limits. In the event of a denial of service attack, or even just a burst of very high load on a service, these resource limits will prevent pods from using all available resources in the node they are running on. You can read more about setting resource quotas and limits here . Route security Within OpenShift, you can expose your services using routes. Creating a route to a service enables your users to access the service through a URL in a browser. If you do not specify any SSL certificates for your route than it would be exposed on HTTP port 80 without any SSL certificate. You can secure these routes with SSL encryption using one of three SSL termination methods: Edge - SSL termination is done on the HAProxy router from which point onwards the traffic is un-encrypted Passthrough termination - There is no SSL decryption on the routers; instead connections are passed straight through the routers to the OpenShift applications, which are then responsible for SSL certificate termination and traffic decryption. Re-Encrypt - This process uses two certificates: the first certificate is held on the HAProxy router and the second in the pods. This secures traffic all the way down to the application. Control plane and data plane lockdown Some of the core components of OpenShift, such as the routers and API pods, are run as root. To minimise any risk of these containers being compromised we can offer IP whitelisting to the control plane and data plane(s) as a whole. UKCloud can lock down your control plane and data plane(s) to a set of addresses or address ranges with the use of Security Groups. These security group rules can be applied at the time of cluster deployment or later via a Service Request to the UKCloud OpenShift Support team. The information we require to apply these rules is which plane you would like these applied to, for example, control plane or data plane (specify internet or community network if applicable) and the source addresses or ranges that will be allowed access. When services are protected by security group rules the traffic is dropped before it reaches OpenShift. Whitelisting You can secure your routes by applying whitelists by IP address. The advantage of doing this is that you can do this yourself, however this does allow traffic to reach the OpenShift route before it is either allowed through or dropped based on the whitelisting you may have applied. We have documented the process of IP whitelisting here . Network Isolation OpenShift uses a software-defined networking (SDN) approach to provide cluster-wide networking that enables communication between pods across the OpenShift cluster. This Container Networking Interface (CNI) runs in the OpenShift SDN project and creates an overlay network using the Open vSwitch (OVS) SDN plugin. OVS has three different plugins based on the type of pod network cluster admins would like to create. Previously we were using the ovs-multitenant SDN plugin but, as of February 2019 and OpenShift 3.11, we have been deploying OpenShift clusters using the ovs-network-policy SDN plugin. This plugin allows project administrators to configure their own network isolation policies using NetworkPolicy objects . We have documented the process of using Network Policy based isolation here .

    "title": "Considerations when scaling an OpenShift cluster | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Considerations when scaling an OpenShift cluster Infrastructure applications With your UKCloud for OpenShift cluster we deploy a number of infrastructure applications by default. These are quality of service features that are intended to help you with the administration, management and application development within your cluster. Examples include the EFK stack, Hawkular Metrics, the integrated registry, the service catalog and, with v3.11 deployments onwards, Prometheus and Grafana. These applications run their components on the infrastructure nodes (these are the nodes with the naming convention worker-infra). Your cluster comes out of the box with two of these nodes and each has 16GB of memory and two vCPUs. This is a perfectly reasonable amount of resource for the infrastructure components for a small cluster running light development workloads. If you're looking to scale out the cluster to a larger size and start running more intensive applications or builds, these nodes may not be enough. For example, the more applications and nodes you have in your environment, the more logs will be gathered off the nodes by fluentd and sent off to Elasticsearch for indexing. This will result in significantly higher resource usage. In the same vein, the more pods and nodes are running in your environment, the more stats hawkular metrics will be gathering and storing in the Cassandra database. Recommendations We recommend having a minimum of three infrastructure nodes with a production deployment where you expect to make use of these additional services, especially with v3.11 deployments onwards as there are now more infrastructure components. As well as having more resource available to the infrastructure applications, running your infrastructure nodes at a scale of three or more will give you increased resilience for these components during patching as the applications will be able to scale up on the two available nodes while the third is being patched. Additionally, scaling of the infrastructure applications to make them more resilient is possible but may require additional infrastructure nodes to be deployed. For example to scale Elasticsearch to three nodes/containers we recommend having a minimum of four infrastructure nodes. To have these applications scaled up or down raise a Service Request via the UKCloud Portal. Finally, you'll want to consider the storage usage of the infrastructure applications. As previously mentioned, the more applications and nodes you have in your environment the more logs will be gathered off the nodes by fluentd and sent off to Elasticsearch for indexing. This means the persistent volume used by Elasticsearch will have more data to store. By default, we provide 14 days retention and a 20GB persistent volume with Elasticsearch. If this volume fills to 100% then the EFK stack will not work until indices are deleted or more space is provided. If you're relying on the EFK stack for your logs then you'll want to determine an average of how much storage your cluster is consuming on logs per day and request an increase of the persistent volume to fit your desired retention. Planning your scale out You'll want to estimate how many pods you are expecting to fit on a node. Things to take into account are the CPU, memory and storage (if your pod is going to be writing to the local file system rather than persistent storage) requirements of your applications. This will give you an idea of the size and amount of nodes you'll need. For more information regarding planning for application requirements, see the following OpenShift documentation page: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/scaling_performance/cluster_limits.html#scaling-performance-planning-your-environment-according-to-application-requirements Scaling If you'd like to scale up your cluster, raise a Service Request via the UKCloud Portal and provide us with the size, network connectivity and quantity of nodes you'd like to add. The same process should be followed to scale a cluster down, this time providing the details of the node(s) you want to remove. Note The network connectivity you request for the scaled up nodes must be present in the cluster. Further information Below are some useful OpenShift documentation pages regarding scaling of a cluster: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/scaling_performance/scaling_cluster_metrics.html https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/scaling_performance/scaling_cluster_monitoring.html Feedback If you find an issue with this article, click Improve this Doc to suggest a change.

    "title": "How to use NetworkPolicy objects to connect services between projects | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to use NetworkPolicy objects to connect services between projects Overview In OpenShift v3.11 clusters deployed from mid-February 2019, the default SDN plugin has been changed from ovs-multitenant to ovs-networkpolicy. This gives you the ability to create NetworkPolicy objects which allow granular control over the flow of communication between the pods, services and projects inside your cluster. By default, we create a NetworkPolicy object, named allow-from-same-and-privileged-namespaces , in every project, including those created after the cluster is deployed. This object allows all pods to communicate with each other inside the same project and allows communication from all pods and services to the default and openshift-monitoring projects. This mirrors the default pod security provided with the ovs-multitenant plugin. This document refers to namespaces and projects. A project is an OpenShift construct on top of a Kuberenetes namespace. For the purpose of this guide they can be thought of as the same thing, however, the oc label commands that are performed on a namespace must be applied to the namespace object, they will not work if you attempt to apply them to the project object. Verifying the cluster SDN In order to verify if the cluster has the ovs-networkpolicy SDN you can use the following command: oc get clusternetwork This will show redhat/openshift-ovs-networkpolicy under the PLUGIN NAME. If this shows ovs-multitenant instead and you wish to use NetworkPolicy objects you will need to raise a service request to look at the options for switching SDN. Note You need to have cluster-reader or higher privilege in the cluster for this command to work. Interacting with NetworkPolicy objects You can interact with NetworkPolicy objects from the command line using the full name networkpolicy or short name netpol, for example: oc get netpol - List NetworkPolicy objects in the current project. oc describe netpol <name> - Provides more detailed information on the named NetworkPolicy object. oc get netpol <name> -o yaml - Provides yaml output of the named NetworkPolicy object. Useful to reference existing rules when creating new objects. Example of connecting services from two different projects NetworkPolicy objects are scoped at the project level. This means if you create a NetworkPolicy object using a template it will be created inside the project you're in and the rules will apply to pods within that project, with the exception of remote projects you may be referencing inside the rule. The object without any rules will look like the following: apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: <desired_name_of_object> namespace: <desired_project> (if not provided this will default to the project you are in when you run oc create) spec: Inside the spec key, you can pass in rules that determine what the NetworkPolicy object does. The first thing you need to consider is the pods you want to target. You can do this using the podSelector key. You can use this to match all pods in a project or alternatively to match all pods with a certain label. You can leave the key blank to match all pods in a project or you can match all pods with a certain label. In our example, we want to match pods with the label role=webserver : apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: webserver-egress namespace: webserver spec: podSelector: matchLabels: role: webserver We've matched the pods inside our webserver project that have the label role=webserver . Now we want to allow these pods to connect to a service inside a project we've named database. To do this, we'll use a namespace selector, which evaluates projects based on a label. In this case, we're going to be looking for the namespace label database=true . First, we need to ensure that this label is applied using the following command: Note The cluster administrator role is required to add labels to namespaces. oc label namespace database database=true Our example NetworkPolicy object now looks like the following: apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: webserver-egress namespace: webserver spec: podSelector: matchLabels: role: webserver egress: - to: - namespaceSelector: matchLabels: database: \"true\" We now have a template for a NetworkPolicy object that matches any pods labeled role=webserver inside the webserver project and allows them to communicate out to any projects labeled database=true . This is only half the work; we still need the ingress allowance inside the database project. Our example template for that object looks like the following: apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: database-ingress namespace: database spec: podSelector: matchLabels: role: database ingress: - from: - namespaceSelector: matchLabels: webserver: \"true\" This object is created in the database project and matches any pods in the project with the label role=database and allows ingress traffic from any project labeled webserver=true . To achieve our desired outcome, we need to label our webserver project as follows: Note The cluster administrator role is required to add labels to namespaces. oc label namespace webserver webserver=true In our example, we've saved our templates in files called netpol.yaml and netpol1.yaml. Use the following commands to create the objects, substituting in the relevant filename: oc create -f netpol.yaml oc create -f netpol1.yaml Now we've created the objects, any pods inside the webserver project matching the label role=webserver can communicate out to the service inside the database project exposed by pods matching the label role=database . Note You can test connectivity by curling the desired target service from the terminal of a pod that has been allowed access to the service. You can find the terminal in the UI or use oc rsh to enter the pod.

    "keywords": "How to use the Hawkular Metrics API Overview This guide is intended to give you enough information to forumulate basic memory usage or cpu queries against nodes in your cluster. For more advanced usage please refer to the Hawkular documentation at https://www.hawkular.org/hawkular-metrics/docs/user-guide/#_metrics or the OpenShift Hawkular repository readme at https://github.com/openshift/origin-metrics/blob/master/docs/hawkular_metrics.adoc . Using the API To query the API, you must be authenticated as a user that has reader permissions on the OpenShift project that contains the Hawkular-Tenant you are querying. If you are querying the _system tenant then you must also have cluster-reader permissions. To get a list of all node level counters and gauges you can use, run the following: curl -X GET https://hawkular-metrics.$(cluster-url)/hawkular/metrics/metrics \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"Hawkular-Tenant: _system\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer $token\" Where $token is a variable storing the output of oc whoami -t from an OpenShift user with the correct permissions to view metrics and $cluster-url is the domain suffix of your cluster. For example, if your cluster URL is https://ocp.openshift-test.cna.ukcloud.com:8443 , your query would be the following: curl -X GET https://hawkular-metrics.openshift-test.cna.ukcloud.com/hawkular/metrics/metrics \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"Hawkular-Tenant: _system\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer $token\" You'll need to pass the output from the request into some form of JSON parser to get human readable results. It will return a series of JSON blocks similiar to the following: { \"dataRetention\": 7, \"id\": \"cluster/memory/usage\", \"maxTimestamp\": 1543500090000, \"minTimestamp\": 1543491120000, \"tags\": { \"descriptor_name\": \"memory/usage\", \"group_id\": \"/memory/usage\", \"type\": \"cluster\", \"units\": \"bytes\" }, \"tenantId\": \"_system\", \"type\": \"gauge\" } This is the gauge for cluster memory usage and you can query the raw data using the id from the above block as follows: curl -X GET https://hawkular-metrics.openshift-test.cna.ukcloud.com/hawkular/metrics/gauges/cluster%2Fmemory%2Fusage/raw \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"Hawkular-Tenant: _system\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer $token\" This will return a series of data points like the following: { \"timestamp\": 1543491120000, \"value\": 3593875456.0 } The timestamp is in Epoch and you can determine the value by looking at the gauge object. The code sample in step 3 shows that the value is in bytes (\"units\": \"bytes\"). Note You must encode the ID returned in the first request (cluster/memory/usage) correctly in the second request by replacing the / with %2F.

    "keywords": "Fixing your IPsec VPN following upgrade to NSX 6.4 With the upgrade to NSX version 6.4, VMware have made a security change to the default settings of the NSX edge gateway's IPsec VPN service. The new default for IPsec VPN service is to use the DH-14 (Diffie–Hellman group 14) algorithm during phase 1 negotiation of the VPN tunnel. You have the option of selecting a different version of Diffie-Hellman in the advanced gateway GUI. The following versions are supported: DH-2 (Diffie–Hellman group 2) DH-5 (Diffie–Hellman group 5) DH-14 (Diffie–Hellman group 14) DH-15 (Diffie–Hellman group 15) DH-16 (Diffie–Hellman group 16) However, during the upgrade of one of our regions we discovered that for edges that have not been converted to advanced gateways that have VPNs configured, the upgrade changes the config on the VPN tunnels to use the DH-14 algorithm instead of the previously only available DH-2. As a result, VPN tunnels are then broken until either of the following is performed: The edge with the affected VPN is upgraded to an advanced gateway and the VPN config is changed from DH-14 back to DH-2 The peer end config is amended to use DH-14 for its ike negotiation UKCloud support staff can change the VPN config back to DH-2 on a temporary basis until the edge is converted, however the setting is not persistent, and under certain configuration changes to an edge, the setting of DH-14 may be reapplied. Converting to an advanced gateway does not require any downtime nor cause any outage during the conversion. Follow the steps below to convert your edge to an advanced gateway and configure your VPN back to DH-2. To complete these steps, you must have access to the UKCloud Portal and vCloud Director. Convert your edge to an advanced gateway To be able to set your VPN to the desired DH setting, you first need to convert your edge to an advanced gateway. To convert your edge to an advanced gateway, see How to convert your edge to an advanced gateway before attempting to continue with the steps below. Change your VPN settings To change the DH setting on your broken VPN: Right-click your edge gateway and select Edge Gateway Services . In the new tenant portal, select the VPN tab. On the IPsec VPN Configuration page, select the IPsec VPN Sites tab. Select the VPN tunnel that is broken and click the edit icon. From the Diffee-Hellman Group list, select DH2. You may need to scroll the window to the bottom of the page to find the list. When you're done, click Keep . Repeat the steps 4 and 5 for any other VPNs that are broken and when you're ready to save the configuration, click Save Changes at the top of the page. Check the state of the VPN by clicking the Statistics tab at the top of the screen and selecting IPSEC VPN to view the health of your VPN.

    "title": "Tier 1 storage | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Tier 1 storage Introduction UKCloud's block storage uses a blended mix of enterprise flash drives, SAS, and NL-SAS disks in RAID 5 and RAID 6 configurations. To achieve the right balance of performance and cost, we use automated storage tiering, where data is tiered according to access patterns. Frequently accessed data will reside on quick-access flash drives, while data that's accessed less frequently (catalogue images, for example) will reside on slower NL-SAS disks. The system evaluates data access over 24-hour periods and may reallocate data to ensure the best system efficiency. We recommend that customers try using the standard Tier 2 storage before deciding to migrate to Tier 1 storage. This is because the use of three tiers of media combined with an additional SSD caching layer, is still the most efficient way to store data for most applications for a couple of key reasons: Most application data ages - data that was once read or changed many times a day eventually becomes out of date or no longer relevant, so is no longer being read or changed. Automatic data tiering moves cold data from SAS or SSD into cost-efficient NL-SAS, not only freeing up space for hotter data on faster media, but also driving down the cost of storing the data. Some applications or parts of applications don't require the low latency that the faster media gives. Examples of this include user file systems or parts of multi-layer applications such as SharePoint. Following feedback from our customers and partners, UKCloud has identified that application latency or unpredictable performance can sometimes stem from the use of the standard three-tier pools for some applications. This happens when data relocation doesn't happen fast enough to adapt to the change in workload profiles. The figure below shows an ideal world compared with reality for data distribution across tiers. To address this issue UKCloud has developed Tier 1 storage to ensure that applications that require consistent or high write performance can achieve it. What is Tier 1 storage? Tier 1 storage sits on enterprise-class technology, so still benefits from the feature set available on the standard Tier 2 storage. However, there are a few subtle changes that increase the performance of workloads sitting on Tier 1 storage. By removing the NL-SAS layer and using a two-tier pool of performance media (SAS and SSD), the negative effect of tiering on the consistent performance of data is reduced. This is because even workloads that are accessed infrequently are serviced by faster spinning media (see the figure below). By increasing the ratio of SSD to SAS, we ensure that a higher proportion of customer data can sit on enterprise flash, rather than on spinning media. So workload IO is serviced a lot quicker. Placing all the drives in RAID 10 configurations rather than a blend of RAID 5 and RAID 6 improves response times of writes to storage under high load. Response times are improved because the storage processors need to do fewer RAID calculations to commit new writes to disk. During periods of high workload, this enables the cache to flush quicker, allowing more host write IOs to be serviced by the storage. Good candidate workloads for Tier 1 storage UKCloud has identified that Tier 1 storage is best for the following use cases. Applications that need consistent performance The nature of multi-tenant environments means that data can sometimes be pushed down to SAS/NL-SAS, even if it is hot. This is because other customers' application data may be hotter. Having a large pool of SSD and no NL-SAS will ensure that customer data has a more predictable performance for both reads and writes. Applications with a high write-to-read ratio (+50% w/r) Some applications will have a large amount of data creation or change, which will involve a lot of write IO to the storage. Using RAID 10 lowers the overhead of the RAID calculation, which reduces the latency of cache flushing to disk. High-performance applications High-performance applications are generally databases or virtual desktops, which require high read and write performance. Data warehousing There are two data warehousing use cases: Occasionally, data may be loaded onto the UKCloud platform but not accessed for a period of time; this data would normally be de-staged to NL-SAS. By not having NL SAS in the Tier 1 pool, the lowest tier will be SAS, which will still provide good performance of both reads and writes, even if the data has been cold for a long time. Alternatively, data can be stored in UKCloud's Cloud Storage and loaded into the Tier 1 storage platform when needed. This maintains high performance for active data without the associated cost of storing infrequently accessed data. Small block, random-write databases Data with a high volume of small random writes will benefit from the enhanced performance that comes from using RAID 10 as the underlying storage. As the graphs below show, the RAID 10 write performance is much better than RAID 5 and RAID 6 for small block writes. Large data sets The higher ratio of SSD to SAS means there's a higher chance that data within a given dataset will be in flash media, accelerating database performance. Unsuitable candidate workloads The following workloads would be considered unsuitable as they won't benefit from Tier 1 storage. Rich media Rich media such as images and audio won't benefit from enhanced write performance. Applications that don't need consistent performance Although not necessarily an unsuitable candidate, if a workload doesn't require consistent performance, there will be no real benefit in putting the data on Tier 1 storage. Low-performance applications Applications that don't need high performance aren't necessarily unsuitable candidates; they just won't see any real benefits from Tier 1 storage. Applications with a high read-to-write ratio (+50% r/w) Applications with a high read ratio don't really benefit from the added performance that Tier 1 storage provides. As the graph below shows, RAID10 doesn't show a real performance increase on reads compared to the other RAID configurations. Identifying good candidate workloads In most cases, you'll be able to judge which workloads are best suited for Tier 1 storage. However in some cases, you may need guidance on which storage a particular application requires. If your application isn't currently running on UKCloud's platform or on another environment, we would recommend building it on the standard Tier 2 storage pool initially. You can then assess its performance once it has been set up and is running under load, and decide whether the workload should be moved to Tier 1 storage. If the workload is currently running on any environment, it's possible to run a performance assessment on the application to understand its characteristics, enabling you to make an informed decision on where it is best placed. You would carry out the performance assessment yourself, supported by one of our Cloud Architects. Limitations Tier 1 workloads are available with the Essential, Power and Priority VM types. Initially, moving a workload to and from the Tier 1 platform will be a manual process that may involve raising a service request via My Calls on the UKCloud Portal. Realistic performance expectations The performance that can be expected from the system will depend on many factors, such as the application's read/write ratio, and whether the IO will be random or sequential in nature. UKCloud's storage platforms are shared by all consumers within the boundary of the security domain. This means we can't provide a guaranteed minimum IOPs or throughput; however, the performance of individual data stores is actively monitored. We regularly review the data store usage metrics, and perform migrations of virtual machines to less populated data stores to alleviate contention.

    "title": "DDoS mitigation service FAQs | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "DDoS mitigation service FAQs What is UKCloud's approach to mitigating DDoS attacks? UKCloud has selected one of the leading providers of DDoS mitigation services and has implemented a hybrid solution. The service comprises both local DDoS mitigation appliances to mitigate smaller attacks, and the ability to leverage additional terabit scale global scrubbing centres if attacks threaten to exceed local capacity. This approach provides a balance between protection against DDoS attacks, without having some of the issues that are seen with an always-on solution (such as affecting legitimate traffic and VPN tunnels) or a manually invoked on-demand solution (where time to mitigate can be excessively long). This mitigation service enhances UKCloud's current ability to absorb typical sized DDoS attacks by providing an additional layer of defence against larger and more complex volumetric DDoS attacks. UKCloud utilises a combination of specialist DDoS mitigation appliances hosted within our data centres and terabit scale scrubbing centres that together implement a suite of DDoS countermeasures as appropriate. This, along with superior incident reporting, enables UKCloud to provide you with the details you need when reporting to GovCERT. You are advised to ensure that suitable application specific protection is in place to mitigate threats at the application layer, such as advanced persistent threats. For this purpose, you can procure an application-tuned DNS based DDoS mitigation solution via UKCloud's Digital Marketplace services. For more information, see Application-tuned DDoS protection FAQs . DDoS mitigation services are expensive, will UKCloud be passing these costs onto customers? No. UKCloud is committed to continually investing in our platform to ensure that it delivers the highest levels of security, availability and scalability. We believe that customers should expect their cloud service providers to deliver increased value and lower prices over time, and this is just one example of how UKCloud demonstrates this belief to our customers and partners. What is the likelihood that legitimate traffic will be blocked by the DDoS mitigation service? This is commonly referred to as a 'false positive', where the DDoS mitigation technology incorrectly identifies legitimate traffic as an attack. Due to the nature of the UKCloud service, normal interactions between your application and end users will be no different from how they are today. In the event of the UKCloud hosted DDoS mitigation appliances identifying an abnormal load, our specialist DDoS mitigation partner will deploy appropriate countermeasures. Impact on legitimate traffic has been a high priority consideration during our evaluation process and we are confident that the specialist provider of DDoS mitigation has appropriate controls across people, process and technology to make the likelihood of false positives almost zero. That said, if your system is subject to a sustained, high volume attack, UKCloud may choose to deploy specific countermeasures against the attacked IP address (and sometimes adjacent IP addresses), which would affect both the attack traffic and legitimate traffic to that specific IP address. UKCloud will use all reasonable endeavours to contact affected customers if we take this action. What additional latency will be incurred through UKCloud's use of the DDoS mitigation service? In normal operation (that is, traffic passing directly through UKCloud hosted DDoS mitigation appliances without requiring countermeasures), there is negligible additional latency to inbound or outbound traffic (rated at less than 80 microseconds). During a DDoS attack, there is negligible additional latency to outbound traffic, but inbound traffic will experience some additional latency, which will vary depending on the mitigation measure being taken. For example, when traffic is redirected through the specialist DDoS scrubbing centres, a sub-10 ms additional latency, caused by BGP routing, will affect inbound traffic to the scrubbing centre, and we expect there to be an additional 10 ms latency affecting only traffic to the IP addresses under attack (incurred by DDoS mitigation technology within the scrubbing centre). So, customers targeted by the attack should experience additional inbound latency of about 20 ms, whereas all other customers should experience lower additional latency of sub-10 ms. What is the largest attack that the DDoS mitigation service can withstand? The specialist provider of DDoS mitigation is designed to withstand multiple simultaneous DDoS attacks. The service is continually being expanded in line with traffic volumes and the capacity of the scrubbing centres currently exceeds 1500 Gbit/s. The typical DDoS attack [1] is less than 2 Gbit/s but attacks of 50 to 60 Gbit/s are not uncommon and some attacks are beginning to exceed 100 Gbit/s. UKCloud subscribe to a tier of service designed to mitigate a specific level of attack. If the attack begins to exceed this level, UKCloud will work with the customer under attack and implement 'null routing' for the targeted IP address to ensure that all other customers continue to benefit from normal service. [1] http://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/analyst/ddos-attacks-advancing-enduring-survey-34700 Does the DDoS mitigation service protect me against all types of 'denial of service' attacks? No. The service is designed to specifically neutralise the impact of highly distributed, volumetric, network layer attacks as these types of attacks most commonly cause 'collateral damage' and 'noisy neighbour' symptoms. The service is not designed to protect specific customers and applications against low-and-slow attacks, advanced persistent threats or application layer threats. Further, if your service is subject to a particularly high volume attack, it is possible that UKCloud will deploy specific countermeasures against your targeted IP address that could effectively make the IP address inaccessible to legitimate users of your service. To ensure you are protected against all types of denial of service attacks, UKCloud recommends that you consider mitigating these application specific threat vectors via appropriate solutions such as Web Application Firewalls, Content Delivery Networks, robust domain name services, and so on. For this purpose, you can procure an application-tuned DNS based DDoS mitigation solution via UKCloud's Digital Marketplace services. For more information, see Application-tuned DDoS protection FAQs . What gives UKCloud the right to 'null route' traffic to my service? In common with most cloud service providers and hosting organisations, the Terms & Conditions (for example, G-Cloud Terms of Business) that all customers agree to as part of the provision of our services entitles UKCloud to suspend a customer's right to access or use all or any part of the services immediately upon notice to you if we determine that your use of the services: creates a security risk to the Services or any third party and / or may adversely impact the Services or the systems or Content of any other of our other Customers. Can I use my own DDoS mitigation service if I have more extensive requirements? Yes. Indeed UKCloud recommend that customers review their preparedness for DDoS attacks and other attacks such as advanced persistent threats and application layer threats. As an example, some customers choose to use a Content Delivery Network or DNS based DDoS mitigation service to provide additional protection against application layer and DNS layer attacks. Such a solution can absorb and mitigate customer specific attacks before the attack traffic hits the UKCloud platform. UKCloud customers are also able to procure an application tuned DNS based DDoS mitigation solution via UKCloud's Digital Marketplace services. For more information, see Application-tuned DDoS protection FAQs . Does the use of these third party DDoS mitigation services affect UKCloud's status as a PSN Accredited service provider? No. UKCloud has consulted with CESG and CERT-UK during our evaluation of the options. As it stands, traffic passed over the internet can be routed through various systems and countries by BGP, the native routing protocol of the internet. You are advised to ensure that your systems use appropriate encryption (for example, SSL, TLS or IPsec) to protect the confidentiality and integrity of your data. These same controls ensure security is maintained even when that data is passed through the scrubbing centres. As with many ISPs, the DDoS mitigation service is not provided by a UK sovereign organisation. Consistent with Principle 8 of the Data Protection Act, no citizen data is transferred to a non-EEA country; rather data packets may merely transit a specialist scrubbing centre located outside the EEA. If a DDoS attack results in a period of unavailability, will I be able to claim service credits? The UKCloud SLA protects you against the unavailability of the UKCloud platform to host your workload or data. A DDoS attack will typically only affect the availability of internet connectivity rather than the workloads and data itself. Due to the variable nature of internet connectivity, the UKCloud SLA does not cover these issues. So, if during a DDoS attack the UKCloud platform continues to run your workloads and provide your data then service credits will not apply. This is because your workload and data might still be available via non-internet connections such as PSN, leased lines, and so on. What reporting will I get as part of this service? If you experience a DDoS attack, you will be informed individually by UKCloud once the attack has been detected by the DDoS mitigation service. When the attack has ended, UKCloud will share a detailed report containing information on the size and duration of the attack, where the attack came from (IPs and autonomous systems) and the type of attack traffic detected (for example, ports and protocols).

    "keywords": "Bandwidth monitoring FAQs What bandwidth monitoring is available? You can currently find out how much internet bandwidth you are consuming either via the UKCloud Portal or Portal API . Where can I view the internet usage reporting on the UKCloud Portal? Within the My VMs section on the UKCloud Portal, select the vOrg you are interested in. Then, click on the \"My VMs\" tab and then select the \"Bandwidth Monitoring\" option. You can then select the edge gateway you wish to retrieve usage metrics for. Alternatively, the Bandwidth Monitoring section can be accessed via the Compute dropdown and by selecting the appropriate vOrg. What information does the report provide? You will have visibility of usage per edge gateway, where you have the options for Hourly Average/Peak, Interval Average/Peak, Hourly Total Usage and Interval Total Usage. I clicked on the edge gateway and I can't see any usage information? If your edge gateway does not have a connection to the internet you will not be able to see any usage information. If your VDC has just been provisioned, it can take up to 4 hours to show utilisation metrics. If these cases do not apply to you, please contact us by raising a Service Request. Are other bandwidth monitoring types available? We have just released a new \"per internet-connected edge gateway\" internet bandwidth report through the UKCloud Portal and we're investigating bandwidth reporting for edge gateways connected to other networks such as N3 (HSCN) and PSN which are on our backlog. We have been using the bandwidth monitoring reporting for some time, what has changed? As part of our continued programme of platform upgrades, we have recently enhanced our internet bandwidth reporting capability, moving to a software- based solution to enable enhanced functionality and increased features for our customers. What regions is bandwidth monitoring available for? Regions 1,2,5 & 6 with edge gateways connected to the internet will show bandwidth usage. Can I use the application programming interface (API) to view my internet bandwidth usage? Yes, as well as viewing your internet bandwidth usage via the UKCloud Portal, we have also enabled the use of the API.

    "keywords": "How to install the GeoDrive Client 2.0 What is the GeoDrive 2.0 Client? The GeoDrive 2.0 Client is a free application that runs on Windows and Windows Server, exposing UKCloud Cloud Storage as file systems. It’s designed as an easy way to use object storage by enabling Windows applications to interface with Cloud Storage servers using the popular S3 REST API. If you require a fully-integrated cloud gateway appliance with features like advanced deduplication and location caching, you may want to consider CloudArrary as an alternative. Note Unlike The GeoDrive 2.0 Client, CloudArray is not a free application. Use cases You can use the GeoDrive 2.0 Client to: Expose UKCloud Cloud Storage for native access on Windows through a centralised server With the GeoDrive 2.0 Client installed on a centralised Windows Server installation. Present Cloud Storage as storage for applications, without additional development. Use Cloud Storage as a target for backups or long-term file retention. Before you begin The GeoDrive 2.0 Client offers a single caching option: Stub : files are initially stored locally and replaced with a stub, or shortcut, after a period of time. When you access a file that has been stubbed, it will be retrieved from the cloud. This offers the best scalability, as you can use a virtually unlimited amount of cloud storage. Installing the GeoDrive 2.0 Client Navigate to the following URL to download the ZIP file that contains the The GeoDrive 2.0 Client installer . Extract and run the setup launcher from the ZIP file. Step through the wizard, adjusting values to suit your environment. Note The Data Directory is used as a local cache for any content you place in the GeoDrive 2.0 drive, so you may want to put this on a non-system volume. When the installation is complete, click Add GeoDrive 2.0 Drive to open the Drive Parameters page. On the Drive Parameters page, select any available drive letter from the drop down menu to use as the GeoDrive 2.0 drive then click Next . Optional: give your ECS drive a description.

    "title": "Cross Domain Security Zone Blueprint | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Cross Domain Security Zone Blueprint Overview Our customers' requirements range from relatively low-security solutions that are natively accessible on the internet, to solutions that must be more restricted and accessible only over government community networks such as the PSN, JANET or HSCN. To meet these varying needs, we've implemented two security domains on our platform, both of which are accredited for hosting systems and data classified at OFFICIAL: Assured OFFICIAL security domain ― directly connected to our DDoS-protected internet, PSN, JANET and HSCN networks Elevated OFFICIAL security domain — natively connected only to the PSN and RLI, it benefits from increased security as all users and devices that can access this security domain are known and trusted The Government Digital Service (GDS) strategy of \"internet is okay\" is dividing opinion across government. On one hand, many applications that were initially PSN connected and only accessible by a closed community are now being connected to the internet, pushing security from the physical network layer to the services themselves, reducing cost and time to delivery. On the other hand, a lot of data is considered too sensitive to be stored in a directly internet-connected environment, where the attack vector of an internet connection creates too much risk. Where customers choose to host their sensitive data in a non-internet connected environment, but still require internet connectivity for some aspects of their service, they can connect their application components which are on Assured OFFICIAL to application components that on Elevated OFFICIAL. To connect these components, a customer must use a Cross Domain Security Zone (CDSZ), which provides a controlled interconnection between the lower-security domain (Assured OFFICIAL) and the higher-security domain (Elevated OFFICIAL). This Blueprint draws on our experience of working with government customers and NCSC to help architect cross-domain solutions. Key principles The role of the customer's accreditor We provide our Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL security domains. Our customers are responsible for the accreditation of the applications they run on either security domain, including any specific use of the UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone. The customer's accreditor is responsible for identifying, assessing and mitigating the specific risks to their individual solution that are created by the use of the UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone. As part of the customer's own assurance activities, we recommend engaging a CLAS or CCP Security Professional and have an IT Security Health Check carried out by a CHECK test provider. Effective risk mitigation When reviewing a UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone application document set, submitted for approval by a customer, UKCloud will expect to see a number of controls included in the solution to adequately mitigate the risks of exposing an application that uses particularly sensitive data to the internet. It isn't necessarily the case that all of these controls will be needed for a solution to be approved, but aiming to include as many of them as possible will help to ensure that the approval process requires less scrutiny, and that the solution can move to the implementation phase much more quickly. Listed below are the controls we believe UKCloud and customer SIROs will expect to see in place when they review a solution that requires the UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone capability. Controls Protective Monitoring and possibly a Security Operations Centre (SOC) Information Assurance Standard (IS) 1 and IS2 Technical Risk Assessment IS1 is a government standard for risk assessment IS2 is a government standard for risk management and accreditation Risk Management and Accreditation Documentation Set (RMADS) Host-based intrusion detection (HIDS) Agents installed within virtual machines (VMs) that collect log data and alert on unusual behaviour or potentially forward to a SOC IT Security Health Check (CHECK) test Penetration test performed by an NCSC CHECK-approved tester Content type checking Security policy defining which content types are permitted (binary/xml/json etc) Deep content inspection Inspection of an HTTP request/response body, including, for example, things such as XML Schema validation or field length checking Data loss prevention Software that prevents data leaving an organisation without permission Anti-virus Consider how definitions are downloaded and made available to VMs Cross Domain Security Zone service options The UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone enables customers to securely transfer data between the UKCloud Assured OFFICIAL security domain and the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL security domain using NCSC-approved cross-domain security patterns. There were three options available within the Cross Domain Security Zone product set, however the UKCloud Guard is due to be retired from sale so there are now two service options available: Secure Remote Access. We provide a self-service remote access solution so that customers who do not have a PSN or RLI connection to their business premises may have a method of managing their environments within Elevated OFFICIAL. Note that this is for management purposes only, and not for end-user access to the Elevated security domain. This service is not covered within this Blueprint. Walled Garden. Self-service management of a Cross Domain Security Zone Walled Garden, enabling customers to implement security applications of their choice. We provide an assurance wrap by ensuring customers use appropriate risk management to understand and mitigate identified risks. How the Walled Garden works UKCloud Walled Garden is a single-tenant walled garden architecture, within a separate zone of the UKCloud platform that customers can populate with VMs to allow communication between applications on the Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL security domains. Customers have full control of the services within their walled garden, enabling them to transmit communications between security domains using any protocols required. Protocols and traffic include RDP, SSH, binaries, and management protocols such as SNMP and NMI. When a customer implements a walled garden, they need to take precautions to ensure the integrity and availability of data across both security domains. These precautions must be documented in the Cross Domain Security Zone submission. Traffic through the walled garden can originate from either Assured or Elevated OFFICIAL. The walled garden can be a target for single or multiple application servers in either platform, and can contain as many virtual machines as are needed to service application requests across the walled garden. The figure below shows an example of a possible setup, but it should be used as a starting point only; customers may want to populate their walled garden with more services to meet their needs. It's important to highlight that there is no pre-defined architectural pattern that a solution must fit into. To help, UKCloud can make recommendations about the architectures that are likely to be approved by the customer accreditors. However, this will be guidance only — each solution will be approved by the end-customer data owner before UKCloud will allow the customer to build. Assured OFFICIAL security domain The Assured OFFICIAL security domain should have: Firewall rules to tightly control traffic to the applications which will talk across the walled garden Anti-virus Protective monitoring Additional techniques to further secure the solution should be used if possible: OS and application hardening to reduce services running on the server, decreasing the surface of vulnerability Logging of events on the server for auditing purposes, with logs included in the protective monitoring solution Content checking to ensure the integrity of data and provide a defence against content attacks It is recommended that it should have an anti-virus product that differs from other anti-virus products used in the overall solution. Walled Garden The Walled Garden consists of a single-tenant walled garden architecture which should include: A protocol break and re-creation, for example by using a reverse proxy Inspection of the data to validate the message structure or message content, to ensure the messages used to convey the application data are correctly encoded, and to confirm that the content within the messages are as expected IDS and logging of events on the VMs for auditing purposes, and alert generation for messages that fail the validation process as part of a protective monitoring solution Anti-virus Other considerations for the Walled Garden include: OS and application hardening to reduce services running on the server, decreasing the surface of vulnerability Implementation of release controls to enforce a whitelist of the data types and content permitted for release through the Walled Garden Direction control for data moving from either high-to-low or low-to-high domains; for example, best practice is to prevent 'pull' requests from the application in the low domain It's good practice to run non-SSL traffic so the Walled Garden doesn't need to decrypt and re-encrypt to inspect the messages. Customers can have different VMs within a single walled garden instance servicing different requests to span the two domains. For example, a customer could have software updates and protective monitoring traffic being serviced by the same VMs within the walled garden. Elevated OFFICIAL security domain The Elevated OFFICIAL security domain should have: Firewall rules to tightly control traffic to the applications that will talk across the Walled Garden Post-authentication to enable access control and auditing Anti-virus Protective monitoring with IDS Additional techniques to further secure the solution should be used if possible: OS and application hardening to reduce services running on the server, decreasing the surface of vulnerability Logging of events on the VMs for auditing purposes, with logs included in the protective monitoring solution Content checking to ensure the integrity of data and provide a defence against content attacks It should also be configured with an anti-virus product that differs from other anti-virus products used in the overall solution. Networking Applications that communicate across the Walled Garden should be placed on a dedicated network segment that can be securely segregated from other segments using firewall rules, managed through the cloud technology's virtual firewalls such as NSX edges, or customers' own virtual firewalls. The inter-environment connections between the firewalls, from Assured OFFICIAL to the Walled Garden, and from the Walled Garden to Elevated OFFICIAL are all controlled by UKCloud to ensure that correct connectivity is maintained. The networking within the customer's environments, within Assured, Walled Garden and Elevated are the customer's responsibility. Customers can choose between two ways of routing traffic to the walled garden, and must state their choice before implementation: To terminate the connection to the walled garden at the edge, and then NAT the traffic into the walled garden To route the traffic directly into the walled garden The figure below shows the network topography for a typical walled garden. High availability The UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone is highly available within a single site. If site-level resilience is required, customers must buy a second Cross Domain Security Zone, which will be configured with the same policy as the primary site. The two instances can then be used: Active/passive via application configuration updates (for example change Walled Garden target in the event of a failure) In active/active configuration, which is perhaps more useful If Cross Domain Security Zone instances will be used in an active/active configuration, the customer needs to implement a load balancer in the Assured or Elevated tier (depending on the direction of the traffic flow) to send requests to both Cross Domain Security Zones. The approval process Every UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone implementation requires customer Data Owner and UKCloud approval before the customer can carry out any implementation work. The approval process is shown below. More information is available in the UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone application process . Step Description 1 Initial Contact Customer contacts UKCloud to register interest in the CDSZ service. This can be through My Calls or direct contact with a Sales representative, Technical Account Manager (TAM) or Cloud Architect. 2a Self-Assessment Customer creates the document pack to illustrate the solution design and provide evidence that all necessary sign-offs and compliance have been obtained. 2b Assurance Wrap Review Customer creates the document pack with assistance from the UKCloud compliance team and Cloud Architect. 3 Design Review Customer presents the technical solution to the Cloud Architect for advice and feedback. 4 Application Submission Customer raises a Service Request and submits the document pack. 5 Service Implementation UKCloud provisions the service and the customer implements their solution. 6 On-Going Compliance Once the implementation is in operation, the customer is responsible for ensuring continuing compliance with Security Operating procedures (SyOps) and other security obligations. UKCloud annually prompts customers to review the existing document pack and provide updated information for any changes to design or approvals. Required documents When you apply for a Cross Domain Security Zone service, you must provide the following documents to show that you have identified and mitigated for any risks: Details of your proposed implementation that covers the intended design in the CDSZ, the Assured and Elevated VDCs you are connecting to and data flows. Evidence (for example, email or signed document) of acceptance of risk from the data owning organisation. This should also indicate if this acceptance is a Tell Us Once agreement that will also apply to future CDSZ implementations by the customer on behalf of the data owner. If a Tell Us Once agreement is already in place between the customer and the data owner, this evidence is not required, but the customer should indicate that such an agreement is in place so that UKCloud can confirm against our list of trusted partners for the data owner. An explicit statement, as part of the Service Request, that the solution has been reviewed by a named UKCloud Cloud Architect or that you do not require a review. The named Cloud Architect must provide review notes as evidence that the review took place. If you're connecting to a PSN Protected enabled VDC, proof of PSN compliance (a copy of PSN CoCo or PSN CoP).

    "keywords": "UKCloud for Microsoft Azure Service Scope About this document This document describes the boundaries of the UKCloud for Microsoft Azure service, along with the division of responsibilities between UKCloud and the customer, to facilitate the provisioning and ongoing use of the service. About UKCloud for Microsoft Azure UKCloud for Microsoft Azure harnesses the innovation of Microsoft’s Azure platform and we deliver this service from within our award-winning government-grade multi-cloud environment – addressing the service, connectivity and diversity requirements of UK public sector organisations and their industry partners. The service is based on the Microsoft Azure Stack product, which has been developed by Microsoft as an extension of the Azure public cloud. Service options You can build a tailored solution to meet your requirements by mixing and matching service options. The choice does not lock you to one service or size, enabling you to scale resources up or down as your requirements change. The options below are all currently available within the service: IaaS compute Virtual machines (VMs) provide the basic building blocks of compute resource within UKCloud for Microsoft Azure. Each standard machine has a pre-allocated number of vCPUs, amount of memory and a temporary disk. The available sizes and families of VMs are continually increasing. Broadly, the following machine families are supported: Basic and Standard A-Series. CPU performance and memory configurations best suited for entry level workloads like development and test. Standard D-Series and DS-Series. Optimised CPU-to-memory configuration, making them suitable for most general-purpose applications. A subset of the D-series VMs also sport higher memory per CPU making them suitable for applications that require higher amounts of memory. Basic and Standard F-series. Optimised for CPU-intensive workloads so have a higher CPU to memory configurations. You can find the full list of supported virtual machine sizes here . You can deploy VMs using the UKCloud Azure Stack portal and other tooling. Warning Each VM contains a temporary disk. The temporary disk provides short-term storage for applications and processes and is intended to only store data such as page or swap files. Data on the temporary disk may be lost during a maintenance event or when you redeploy a VM. Storage options There are several ways in which storage can be addressed in UKCloud for Microsoft Azure: Azure Blob Storage (Page) Page blobs are optimized for representing IaaS disks and supporting random writes that are up to 1 TB in size. An Azure Stack virtual machine attached IaaS disk is a Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) stored as a page blob. At present only unmanaged disks can be offered in the service. Azure Blob Storage (Block) Block blobs (generically known as object storage) are optimised for streaming and storing cloud objects, and are a good choice for storing documents, media files, backups, and so on. Azure Blob Storage (Append) Append blobs are optimised for append operations. An append blob can be updated only by adding a new block to the end. Append blobs are a good choice for scenarios such as logging, where new data needs to be written only to the end of the blob. Azure Queue Storage In designing applications for scale, application components are often decoupled, so that they can scale independently. Queue storage provides a reliable messaging solution for asynchronous communication between application components, whether they're running in the cloud, on the desktop, on an on-premises server, or on a mobile device. Queue storage also supports managing asynchronous tasks and building process workflows. A storage account can contain any number of queues, and a queue can contain any number of messages, up to the capacity limit of the storage account. Individual messages may be up to 64 KB in size. Azure Table Storage Table storage is Microsoft's NoSQL key/attribute store - it has a schemaless design, making it different from traditional relational databases. With a schemaless data store, it's easy to adapt your data as the needs of your application evolve. Table storage is easy to use, so developers can create applications quickly. Table storage is a key-attribute store, which means that every value in a table is stored with a typed property name. The property name can be used for filtering and specifying selection criteria. A collection of properties and their values comprise an entity. Since table storage is schemaless, two entities in the same table can contain different collections of properties, and those properties can be of different types. You can use table storage to store flexible datasets, such as user data for web applications, address books, device information, and any other type of metadata that your service requires. For today's internet-based applications, NoSQL databases like table storage offer a popular alternative to traditional relational databases. A storage account can contain any number of tables, and a table can contain any number of entities, up to the capacity limit of the storage account. Note All storage in Azure Stack is taken from a common pool. When designing your service for UKCloud for Microsoft Azure, consider the best usage of your storage. For example, if you have a large object storage requirement, consider using the UKCloud's Cloud storage platform as part of your solution. Service management API. Enables you to programmatically interact with UKCloud for Microsoft Azure resources. UKCloud for Microsoft Azure Marketplace – provides access to pre-created images, which help speed up application delivery. Azure Resource Manager – enables you to write templates to deploy, update and delete UKCloud for Microsoft Azure resources in a single coordinated operation. VM Extensions – UKCloud for Microsoft Azure supports virtual machine extensions that provide post deployment management for automation (for example, PowerShell DSC). Network UKCloud manages the physical firewalls that face public and secure networks. You can deploy multiple gateway devices and configure the following using either the UKCloud Azure Stack portal or API: Virtual networks – UKCloud for Microsoft Azure enables you to configure virtual private clouds, and create and manage your private address space within Azure. You can configure this via the UI, API or other tooling Load balancers (IPv4 only) – you can deploy basic load balancers VPN gateway – you can use the UKCloud for Microsoft Azure VPN gateway to create site-to-site VPNs to remote infrastructure Routing – basic custom defined routing can be configured on virtual networks Internet-facing solutions have 8 usable public IP addresses. You can ask for additional public IP addresses via a Service Request. We reserve the right to decline the request if you have spare capacity in your existing deployment. Advanced features Key Vault. UKCloud for Microsoft Azure provides cryptographic secret storage for applications and services. These services can be consumed via both portal and API. More information found here . Protection options You are responsible for designing your own disaster recovery and backup solutions as part of your adoption of UKCloud for Microsoft Azure. Service availability The availability of your virtual machines in UKCloud for Microsoft Azure follows the same principles of the Microsoft Azure Public Cloud, where customers achieve a higher service level availability based on how they architect the solution. The service levels are as follows: 99.90% (a single VM deployed as a single instance deployed inside a zone) 99.95% (a single VM with two instances deployed inside a zone) Tip To qualify for the higher service level, we advise that you use on-platform tools, like availability sets, that ensure your VMs are provisioned to different hardware in the zone. Service background VMs are fully provisioned. The system is configured to automatically balance resources, so your VMs may be moved between physical hosts. We actively capacity-manage the cloud platform to ensure you have access to the resources you request. You can specify the site where you would like to have your service provisioned (from sites where UKCloud for Microsoft Azure is available). The UKCloud for Microsoft Azure service is updated regularly with the latest code release from Microsoft - typically, this is once a month and notified via the UKCloud service status page and the UKCloud Portal . UKCloud aim to be within two updates from Microsoft, however, we will control the release of the patches into the live service. Through the UKCloud Azure Stack portal you can use availability sets so that VMs do not run on the same physical host. You can make additional configurations inside a VM (such as acting as a secondary hypervisor or implementing third-party software technologies), however, we do not support these customer implementations. Azure Marketplace UKCloud for Microsoft Azure includes access to a local version of the Azure Marketplace. The Marketplace contains a collection of services, applications, and resources customized for Azure Stack that you can deploy in your environment. Every Marketplace item has: An Azure Resource Manager template for resource provisioning Metadata, such as strings, icons, and other marketing collateral Formatting information to display the item in the portal We've pre-populated the Marketplace with a variety of images and templates that have been identified as the most useful services. You can request additional resources are added, provided they are approved for use on Azure Stack. A full list of available items can be found here . You are responsible for ensuring that you have appropriate licensing and support in place for any item deployed from the Marketplace not licensed by UKCloud. Operating systems Licensing We can provide: OS licensing for Microsoft Red Hat Enterprise Linux licensing For the latest available licences, check the Service Definition . You can bring your own licensing for Red Hat and certain Microsoft application licensing under Microsoft Mobility using software assurance. You should inform UKCloud via a Service Request if you're providing your own licensing for a retrospective discount. For non-UKCloud issued software, you must obey the licensing requirements of the software provider. This includes being aware of any constraints around using the software in a virtualised environment. VM server images We provide base VM images for the operating systems (OS) for which we provide licensing, along with images for various free Linux distributions (such as Ubuntu, CentOS & Debian). You can access these from the Marketplace available within the UKCloud Azure Stack portal. You can use your own images for non-Windows and RHEL services, where licensing stipulates that to use the VM on our platform it must be licensed (and reported back to the software vendor) by UKCloud. Anti-virus. We do not provide anti-virus software as part of the service. Protective monitoring We have implemented GPG 13-aligned Protective Monitoring across the Assured and Elevated security domains at the hypervisor level and below. We don't provide Protective Monitoring services above the hypervisor (for example, for your VM) - it is your responsibility to act at this level. In line with UKCloud's SISP, we provide notification of customer-impacting security incidents. It is your responsibility to report similar incidents to us. Platform management Users can access, manage and view the UKCloud for Microsoft Azure service, accessing only those features allowed by your role, in any of the following ways: Azure Stack API. Enables the programmatic creation and management of the services inside the platform. Azure Stack graphical UI. Provides a graphical interface to access the Azure Stack environment (depending on assigned permissions). UKCloud Portal. Access to service reporting and incident and request management. You cannot access the underlying infrastructure. This includes (but isn't limited to) the hardware. Service reporting Visibility. You can use the UKCloud Azure Stack portal to configure multiple views of your estate and monitor the health of your services in real time. This includes utilisation of individual components, alerts and recent operations. Reporting. We provide a monthly service report via the UKCloud Portal. This includes a summary of platform availability and a retrospective of the interactions with UKCloud support during the previous month. Maintenance notifications and Service Status reports are also delivered through the Portal and via the UKCloud status page . Billing. We provide you with monthly bills covering your monthly spend. Customer service Customer Success Manager (CSM). All new customers of the service have access to a UKCloud Customer Success Manager, who will help you with your adoption of the UKCloud for Microsoft Azure service, including finding relevant systems and using UKCloud tools and processes. Cloud Architects. Cloud Architects support you during the design of solutions for the cloud platform. Cloud Architects are ideally placed to help reconcile your requirements with the UKCloud platform. We recommend engagement with a Cloud Architect when implementing complex solutions, such as those using HybridConnect or a Walled Garden. Technical Account Managers (TAM). You will be allocated with an assigned point of contact who will provide ongoing assistance with reporting and incident escalation. Support. After the initial on-boarding and design phase, you can utilise the standard UKCloud support entitlement, which is documented in the Customer Engagement Factsheet . Customer responsibilities You are responsible for defining which Azure Active Directory (AAD) you want to link your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure service to. You can choose to link to your existing AAD, or ask UKCloud to create a new AAD solely for the use of this service. You are responsible for assessing whether the UKCloud platform can support the various requirements of your application. The control and management of access and responsibilities for end users including appropriate connectivity, security and accreditation if required. If access is required over government community networks (PSN, HSCN, Janet or RLI), you are responsible for adhering to the relevant Code of Connection (CoCo) and for providing evidence of your CoCo to UKCloud upon request. UKCloud is unable to provide access to secure networks where you have not provided the required evidence. Management and administration of layers above the hypervisor (OS patching, application performance monitoring, user administration). You are also responsible for ensuring only lawful data that supports the UK public sector is stored and processed by applications on this environment, and that you fully comply with the UKCloud Security Operating Procedures (SyOPs) and other information assurance requirements as specified in the UKCloud System Interconnect and Security Policy (SISP) and associated accreditation documentation sets. Service provisioning Within 4 hours of accepting an order (shorter deployment times are typically achieved and can be prioritised upon request), UKCloud will create the customer's Primary Administrator account and send a Welcome Pack which includes the URL for the UKCloud Customer Portal, and the getting started guide. We've created several articles, guides and FAQs to help you get up and running quickly and easily. These are available within our Knowledge Centre . In addition, you will be assigned a Customer Success Manager (CSM) to provide any assistance required during the first 90 days of the service. UKCloud also has a large ecosystem of partners who can deliver additional services, such as support and professional services. UKCloud would be pleased to introduce you to the right partner to suit your needs. Service constraints UKCloud will adhere to the following in terms of maintenance windows: \"Planned Maintenance\" means any pre-planned disruptive maintenance to any of the infrastructure relating to the service. Planned Maintenance activity may result in periods of degradation or loss of availability depending on the nature of the activity required. In such cases, UKCloud shall provide affected customers with at least fourteen (14) days' notice of the Planned Maintenance. If during Planned Maintenance there is a loss of availability outside the scope described in the planned maintenance notification to the service, an SLA event will be triggered. \"Emergency Maintenance\" means any urgent maintenance required to prevent or mitigate against any event compromising the infrastructure relating to the service. Whenever possible, UKCloud shall: a) provide affected customers with at least six (6) hours' advance notice and b) carry out the emergency maintenance between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Friday or between the hours of Saturday 00:00 to 06:00 (UK local time) on Monday, (including bank holidays) unless there is an identified and demonstrable immediate risk to customer environment(s). Emergency Maintenance may result in periods of degradation or loss of availability depending on the nature of the activity required.

    "keywords": "How to create a virtual machine using Terraform on Azure Stack This document explains how to create a VM using the azurestack Terraform provider with Service Principal Name authentication. Prerequisites Prerequisites from a Windows-based external client. Terraform executable Download Terraform An active Azure Subscription (required to create SPN if you want to use the same SPN for both Azure and Azure Stack) Service Principal Name How To create Service Principal Name for Azure Stack Official Documentation Azure Stack Provider Website Azure Stack Provider GitHub Repository How to use Terraform with Azure Stack Authentication In order to authenticate with Terraform you will need to have a valid Service Principal Name (SPN) - how to create one is described in Prerequisites . Note You only need your Service Principal Name (SPN) to be assigned to your Azure Stack subscription, despite what official Terraform documentation says. The process of authentication can be handled in one of two ways, either as Environment Variables or in the Provider Block . Environment Variables Option - you can create your terraform plan by putting only the plan itself into example.tf and then keep variables.tf separate. You have to declare the actual values in the terraform.tfvars file. This is the file that you will need to populate with your actual credential details. Note You can also put the content of variables.tf in the example.tf at the top of the file. Provider Block Option - you can create your terraform plan by putting everything in one example.tf file, which then contains your Provider settings explicitly in said plan. Official Variables Guide Example of Environment Variables variables.tf variable \"arm_endpoint\" {} variable \"subscription_id\" {} variable \"client_id\" {} variable \"client_secret\" {} variable \"tenant_id\" {} example.tf provider \"azurestack\" { arm_endpoint = \"${var.arm_endpoint}\" subscription_id = \"${var.subscription_id}\" client_id = \"${var.client_id}\" client_secret = \"${var.client_secret}\" tenant_id = \"${var.tenant_id}\" } terraform.tfvars # Configure the Azure Stack Provider arm_endpoint = \"https://management.{region}.{domain}\" subscription_id = \"xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxx\" client_id = \"{applicationId}@{tenantDomain}\" client_secret = \"{applicationSecret}\" tenant_id = \"xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxx\" Example of Provider Block example.tf # Configure the Azure Stack Provider provider \"azurestack\" { arm_endpoint = \"https://management.{region}.{domain}\" subscription_id = \"xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxx\" client_id = \"{applicationId}@{tenantDomain}\" client_secret = \"{applicationPassword}\" tenant_id = \"xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxx\" } Argument Reference arm_endpoint - The Azure Resource Manager API Endpoint for your Azure Stack instance. This will be https://management.{region}.{domain} . Note For UKCloud Region it is https://management.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com . subscription_id - The ID of your Azure Stack Subscription. client_id - The Application GUID that you configured your Service Principal Name (SPN) to use. client_secret - The Application password that you configured your Service Principal Name (SPN) to use. tenant_id - The tenant ID of your Azure Active Directory tenant domain. It can either be the actual GUID or your Azure Active Directory tenant domain name. Creating a VM The examples that follow show how to create a VM using Terraform. The code changes depending on whether you are creating a VM with an unmanaged disk or a managed disk. Select the the type of disk you want to use to update the examples below with the appropriate code. An unmanaged disk A managed disk </form> Create a VM with Public IP template - using Environment Variables option Important This is only the example.tf file.

    "keywords": "How to create a service principal name for Azure Stack using the Azure portal This document explains how to create a service principal name to manage Azure and Azure Stack using the Azure portal. It will guide you through the creation of: An Azure application A service principal name Role assignment Permissions What is a service principal name? An Azure service principal name (SPN) is a security identity used by user-created applications, services, and automation tools to access specific Azure resources. Think of it as a 'user identity' (username and password or certificate) with a specific role, and tightly controlled permissions. It only needs to be able to do specific things, unlike a general user identity. It improves security if you grant it only the minimum permissions level needed to perform its management tasks. To log in and manage your resources via SPN you'll need to create an Azure application and then assign an SPN to it. Only then will you be able to perform tasks against your environment. Prerequisites An active Azure subscription Create an SPN Log in to the public Azure portal . In the favourites panel, select Azure Active Directory . In the Azure Active Directory blade, select App registrations . On the App registrations page, click the + New registration button. In the Register an application blade, enter the following information: Name - The name of the application. Should have a minimum of four characters. Supported account types - Lets you decide who can use the service principal. Redirect URI (optional) - The URL which the authentication response is sent to. In this instance, you can leave it blank. Click Register . Gathering SPN credentials On the blade that has now opened, copy the Application ID and store it somewhere secure. This value is sometimes referred to as the SPN Client ID. On the blade menu, click the Certificates & secrets button. Under Client secrets , click the + New client secret button. Enter a description for the key, select a expiry duration, then click Add . Copy the displayed value for the key and store it somewhere secure. This value is referred to as the SPN Client Secret. Configure role-based access control for the SPN on Azure Stack Log in to the UKCloud Azure Stack portal. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for Microsoft Azure . Navigate to the resource you want to give the SPN access to. In this example we are adding the SPN to the subscription resource to give it permission to all resources.

    "keywords": "Journaling Protection Service Scope About this document This document explains what is and isn't included in the scope of the Journaling Protection service option. Journaling Protection is one of a variety of on‑platform protection options available from UKCloud. Use this Service Scope to understand Journaling Protection and whether it will meet your own recovery point (RPO) or recovery time (RTO) objectives. About Journaling Protection Journaling Protection (powered by Zerto) is a powerful, self-service replication and recovery tool that can improve organisational resilience and enable seamless migration of applications between UKCloud's enabled regions. You can protect your Virtual Machines(VMs) by adding Journaling Protection to the vApp that contains those VMs. When you add Journaling Protection to a vApp, every write operation to the VMs in that vApp is copied and stored in a journal on the recovery site. This means that in the event of a VM being compromised, (for example, by a virus attack or bad software update) you can quickly recover the VM to a point in time before the event. You can add Journaling Protection to a vApp by adding it to a virtual protection group (VPG). Each VM in the protected vApp is synchronised to the recovery site and a journal is created. After this initial sync, each subsequent write operation to the VM is processed as normal on the protected site and a copy is asynchronously sent to the recovery site and written to the journal. When the specified journal history is reached (for example, 14 days), as new journal entries are created, older entries are written to the recovery VM's virtual disks. Every few seconds a checkpoint is written to every journal for each VM in the VPG to ensure crash-consistency between the VMs. If you need to recover a VM, you select a checkpoint to recover to. For example, in the case of a virus, you could recover to a checkpoint from before the virus attack. During recovery, the vApp and its VMs are created on the recovery site and the recovery disks for each VM are attached to the recovered VM. Information in the journal is then promoted to the VM to bring it up to the date and time of the selected checkpoint. Frequency and timing UKCloud's Journaling Protection service is designed to provide customers with recovery points that are as little as seconds behind the running VM. UKCloud's standard journaling profile provides: Target RPO of 5 Minutes Journal history of 2, 7, 14 or 28 days At present, UKCloud have not enabled the ability for customers to configure custom profiles. If the target RPO is exceeded, the customer and UKCloud will be notified via the Zerto self-service portal. Factors that can affect the RPO are: Rate of change of the data on a VM. VMs with a large rate of change in the data will potentially achieve slightly longer RPO's than those VMs that have a lower rate of change Any network latency or storage performance challenges. UKCloud monitors its estate to ensure that network and storage performance are in line with platform expectations. Any deviations are alerted to our technical teams to resolve. Additionally, the service will also alert if a customer's journal exceeds 75% in size of the original VM. This alert is utilised to understand if the customer's solution is being protected adequately. Journaling Protection only works for VM's currently on the platform -- it will only capture data whilst a VM is turned on. If a VM is deleted in vCloud Director -- Journaling Protection will IMMEDIATELY delete the associated journal. What SLA do you offer on snapshot success? UKCloud do not offer an SLA around the VMs protected by UKCloud's Journaling Protection solution. However, the status of journaled VM's is monitored continuously, and the UKCloud support team investigates all failures or service degradation. Other The service is not backed by service credits. On occasion, planned maintenance may disrupt the operation of the Journaling Protection service. This may lead to the service being unavailable, or a temporary increase to the RPO a customer may be able to achieve on the platform. If there's a potential disruption, we'll highlight this to you via the service status page and UKCloud Portal notifications system. Journaling Protection management Customers of the Journaling Protection service are able to self-manage their protected environment via the self-service portal. This portal allows customers to: Configure virtual protection groups Opt vApps into the VPGs Monitor the performance of their platform View the current RPO of their applications and current available history Perform test failovers Perform live failovers UKCloud have disabled some areas of the self-service portal as they are for services we do not presently support. These include: Backup to external systems. At present, customers are unable to export their journal to external backup targets (such as UKCloud Cloud Storage). We have identified a compliance issue with this solution which we are working to address. Until this is addressed, the feature will remain unavailable. Additionally, the following scenario cannot be supported: Organisation network IP subnets can only be different in the protected and recovery sites if IP Pool or DHCP address assignment is used in both sites. If manually assigned IPs are used in the protected site, the configured recovery organisation network on the recovery site must have the same IP subnet as on the protected site. Alerting and reporting The self-service portal provides live real time reporting of your solution and the current level of protection being provided to your vApp. The self-service portal will also provide customers with alerts should the target RPO of their VPG exceed the threshold, or the associated journal size grows beyond the expected size. In both these scenarios, UKCloud will also receive a platform monitoring alert and investigate the cause. Additionally, the self-service portal provides visibility of an activity log of the actions against a particular VM and a list of any errors captured on the platform. Failover The Zerto self-service portal allows customers the ability to failover to their recovery site. When this is initiated, the Journaling Protection service will failover the VMs inside a vApp, restoring the data and state of the VMs to the desired point from inside the Journal. The Journaling Protection service can also replicate any internal networking rules. The customer will need to manually configure: External networking configurations - including configuring VPNs and making any external firewall or DNS changes Check for application consistency Licensing All licensing is provided by UKCloud. At present, customers cannot bring their own licensing. Feedback If you find an issue with this article, click Improve this Doc to suggest a change.

    "title": "Dedicated Compute Service Scope | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Dedicated Compute Service Scope About this document This document is for customers considering purchasing our Dedicated Compute service. It describes the boundaries of the service, along with the division of responsibilities between UKCloud and the customer to facilitate the changes required. About Dedicated Compute Dedicated Compute enables you to have a reserved, single-tenanted section of our cloud, where the physical CPU and RAM allocations are known. This service is designed for customers who: Are looking to run abnormal sized VMs - such as those larger than our standard T-shirt sizes Looking to meet specific software licensing requirements Have an increased security requirement that can be met by Dedicated Compute infrastructure Default setup We deliver Dedicated Compute by providing you with dedicated physical blades on which you control resource allocation. The initial Dedicated Compute purchase is a starter pack consisting of two physical blades. The standard blade consists of 20 physical cores (40 hyper-threaded cores) and 300 GiB of RAM. You can then scale your estate by purchasing expansion packs. After nine expansion packs, you must buy another starter pack. You choose between Tier 1 or Tier 2 storage for your VMs, both of which can include a backup service. Full details of service options and pricing are given in the Service Definition. The storage pool isn't a dedicated hardware resource: it is drawn from our Cloud Storage solutions. These resources are grouped in a private virtual data centre (pVDC) which is available only to the individual Dedicated Compute customer. Resilience and resource reservations We operate at least N+1 for hardware resilience on our Dedicated Compute service. However, we recommend sizing your resilience according to your workload profile. We will reserve at least one physical blade's worth of resources from your allocation to ensure that, in the event of a hardware failure, the service can continue to run and support your workload. During a failure scenario, VMs will be restarted on surviving hosts within the Dedicated Compute cluster. UKCloud is not responsible for any performance degradation of VMs in the Dedicated Compute cluster caused during a failure scenario due to over contention in the remaining hosts. The table below shows the configuration, the resources available to a customer, the number of physical blades in the configuration, and the UKCloud resources reserved to run it. Customer available resources Physical blades Resource reservation Starter pack 20 cores, 300 GiB RAM 2 50% (20 cores, 300 GiB RAM) Starter pack + 1 expansion pack 40 cores, 600 GiB RAM 3 33% (20 cores, 300 GiB RAM) Starter pack + 2 expansion packs 60 cores, 900 GiB RAM 4 25% (20 cores, 300 GiB RAM) Resource utilisation To improve performance, Dedicated Compute uses all physical resources available in the installation and balances the load across them, without consuming the reserved capacity mentioned above. This means that in general operation within the starter pack, there is a 50% utilisation of both physical blades: However, you can create VMs of any size and shape you require, up to the maximum size of the physical capacity of one blade - 20 physical cores (40 vCPU) and 300 GiB RAM. A VM cannot span across physical blades so, if you create a VM larger than 50% of the blade capacity, the Dedicated Compute installation may carry more of the contingency capacity of one physical blade than of the others: You can over-contend the resources on your Dedicated Compute as you see fit. Deployment options There are two deployment options for Dedicated Compute: UKCloud-defined - You select a workload type for your VDC based on UKCloud's Enterprise Compute Cloud VM types (ESSENTIAL, POWER or PRIORITY). Any VMs will inherit the characteristics and reservation levels of that service when deployed. Customer-defined - You can set reservation levels on a per-VM basis. Platform management Dedicated Compute is managed in the same way as our other cloud services, using vCloud Director, the UKCloud Portal, and APIs associated with both. The Dedicated Compute service will be maintained to the same software patch revisions as our main platform. It's not currently possible to see the level of provisioned/utilised resources against the Dedicated Compute service on the UKCloud Portal. (This is a development item on the UKCloud Portal roadmap.) In the meantime, we can provide this information on request. Service provisioning You can request Dedicated Compute via your account manager or using the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. The minimum commitment period to the service is 90 days. The notice period is 90 days. On receipt of all relevant information, we will deploy the service within 10 working days for standard configurations. Customer responsibilities You need to be aware of the following customer responsibilities relating to deployment of, configuration of and migration into the Dedicated Compute service, which are in addition to the usual responsibilities placed on customers of our UKCloud for VMware service: Creating VMs in the new environment Migrating VMs from existing environments by cloning and copying turned-off VMs, or by moving turned-off vApps to the new environment Ensuring you have the right licensing in place for the applications in use in your Dedicated Compute environment If you select the customer-defined deployment option, you must manage your own reservation levels It is your responsibility to purchase enough Dedicated Compute modules to ensure that there is enough resource available to your VMs in the event that one or more hosts fail. If you need any help ensuring you have enough resource in your Dedicated Compute cluster, contact your Cloud Architect.

    "keywords": "Bring Your Own Firewall Service Scope About this document This document is intended for UKCloud customers who might be considering an alternative virtual firewall or virtual appliance to the presently integrated VMWare vCNS firewall device within vCloud Director. The scope of the document is not to provide step by step detail on how to setup or install an alternative virtual firewall but rather the key points that a customer should consider when choosing an alternative product. The document describes the responsibilities of both UKCloud and the customer in order to facilitate the changes required. About Bring Your Own Firewall Bring your own firewall allows customers to customise their networking infrastructure by installing their own virtual firewall appliance in place of the vCNS device UKCloud includes as standard with its compute services. This can allow customers to leverage their own in-house expertise with a particular technology or can provide access to some higher level networking functionality not natively available in the vCNS device. Default setup Presently UKCloud only offers a \"bring your own firewall\" installation to new VDCs. In a BYOF implementation, UKCloud present an external network directly to the customer, who can then install the firewall instance of their choice. UKCloud responsibilities Upon a customer's request, UKCloud will: Deploy a new VDC without a vCNS device Present the external network to the customer for them to install their own firewall device Once the customer has installed their own firewall device, UKCloud will continue to: Manage platform availability Manage the external network Customer responsibilities By requesting to have the edge gateway device removed and their own firewall technology installed, the customer accepts that: Customers are responsible for sourcing their own licensing arrangement with the 3rd party firewall provider. Customers are responsible for installing and configuring the firewall device. Guidance on how this might be done can be found in the UKCloud Blueprint . UKCloud do not offer any support of customer installed firewall replacements. This includes but not limited to install, configuration and troubleshooting issues. UKCloud will not be able to perform any network diagnostic tasks on the customer side of the firewall (inside the VDC). Outages caused by the customers new firewall will not be liable to service credit claims. Customers lose the visibility of the IP address assignments which are currently easily referenced within vCloud Director. Customers lose the integrated functionality of configuring the edge gateway device through vCloud Director. Access to the new firewall replacement is only available via the console or from within the customer VDC (based on setup).

The process requests that the admin/user run the following steps: Launch command prompt with administrator rights Enter: C:\\>slmgr /skms kms.ukcloud.com:1688 If successful you'll be greeted with the following: If however, you see a response that gives the error “The activation server determined the specified product key is blocked”, you'll then need to run the following command, to verify the error and rectify the problem: C:\\>slmgr /dli The above command will display the current licensing information along with activation status. Once you have run this command you will see a similar message (The message should state “VOLUME_KMSCLIENT channel”) If the above message differs and references “RETAIL”, then the Windows license you have is not compatible and cannot be activated by the KMS server, and as such will require you to convert the current retail license to a volume activation license. To complete this process you'll need to have your exact version of Windows and cross reference the product key with the distribution on the Microsoft KB. http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff793409.aspx#E4IAC You can then update the key and re-activate the VM by typing: C:\\>slmgr /ipk “PRODUCTKEY” Once finished, simply follow the standard activation process. “Error: 0xC004C003 The activation server determined the specified product key is blocked” This error can usually be attributed to the software license key being assigned to software product itself. If you are intending to utilise a ‘retail’ version of Windows Server, within the UKCloud infrastructure, the license key will need to be modified in order for the UKCloud KMS server to recognise the version and activate the software. The steps in the attachment should help to successfully rectify the error being returned by the UKCloud KMS server but, before starting, please ensure: You must have full admin access to the Windows VM you are activating You must know the exact version of Windows you are running You reference the following Microsoft KB article: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff793409.aspx#E4IAC Feedback If you find an issue with this article, click Improve this Doc to suggest a change.

    "keywords": "UKCloud Portal API Reference Guide Overview This is an application programmer's guide designed for those wanting to interact with the UKCloud Portal via use of an application programming interface (API). We will update this document with API calls as they become available. Accessing the Portal API The entry point URL for the Portal API is: https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/api For information and examples about how to use the Portal API, see How to use the UKCloud Portal API . Response HTTP status codes Code Reason 200 All OK 201 Created resource OK 202 Accepted 400 Bad request 401 Authorization error 403 Forbidden 404 URL resource not found 422 Unprocessable entity 500 Error with operation POST /api/authenticate Authenticates your API session.

    "keywords": "Portal permissions Overview System administrators are presented with several options to control user permissions through the UKCloud Portal. The information below is intended as a brief guide to which permissions are applied using each setting. User is admin? User gets full administrative privileges across the entire account. This includes all of the permissions listed below. Permissions for Settings Update: A user can update all of the account settings. This includes changing the security methods applied to the account, such as updating security restrictions to require memorable word, password timeout and 2FA. These users can also change the details of the accounts primary and secondary contacts. All: Presently this offers the same capability the update permission. Leave these boxes unchecked to deny a user these capabilities. Permissions for Contacts Contact and user permissions dictate whether the user is able to make changes to who has access to the account, and their role inside of it. A contact is just contact details, they may not necessarily have an actual user account. To enable a contact to have User access, they must be marked as \"active\". Create Read Update Delete All Contact Can create a new contact for that account. Can view existing contacts in that account. Can edit existing contacts but cannot create new ones. Can delete existing contacts. All of the above. User Can create a user associated to a contact for that account and assign permissions. Can view existing users for contacts. Can edit existing users and their permissions. Can delete existing users from contacts. All of the above. Permissions for Support Support Permissions dictate whether a user can view and raise support tickets, and whether they can view other users support tickets. Create Read Update All User support tickets Can log their own support tickets in their name. Can view their own support tickets. Can update their own support tickets. All of the above. Account support tickets Can log their own support tickets. Can view all tickets logged by users across that account. Can update anyone’s support ticket across that account. All of the above. Permissions for UKCloud for VMware Compute service permissions are based on the vCloud director RBAC (role based access control permissions). These roles are applied on a service by service basis - for example someone might be a catalogue author of one service, and a console only user in a secondary service. The roles exposed are: Admin Catalogue Author vApp Author vApp User Console Only You can find further details of these roles in Chapter 11 of the vCloud Director Administrator's Guide. In addition, UKCloud have created an API Only role, that restricts users to accessing vCloud Director solely via the API - no GUI access. Permissions for Cloud Storage Users need to be granted access to the relevant namespace. Once access is granted, the user will be able to see the namespace, list the buckets in the namespace and reset the secret key. The user will also be able to see consumption data for namespaces and buckets. Permissions for UKCloud for OpenStack Users need to be granted access to the relevant OpenStack project. Once access is granted, the user can access the Horizon dashboard for the project. Permissions for Billing Users can see financial data for their compute services in My VMs. This includes spend to date and estimated spend for the month. Permissions for Monitoring Users with Read permissions can view showback information from the Protective Monitoring service on the My Security Events page.

    "title": "How to use the UKCloud Portal API | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to use the UKCloud Portal API Overview The UKCloud Portal API enables you to interact programmatically with your UKCloud environment. For example, you can use API calls to create, manage and monitor Service Requests and view information about the components of your environment. This guide shows you how to use the API by providing a worked example that steps through the process of creating a new virtual data centre (VDC). For more information about any of the API endpoints used in this guide, see the UKCloud Portal API User Guide . About the examples in this guide The examples in this guide use endpoints that are available only in regions 5 and 6 of the UKCloud platform. If your environment is in a different region, you won't be able to use these endpoints yourself, however you should still find the guide useful as a reference for how to use the Portal API. For more information about UKCloud regions, see Understanding sites, regions and zones . The examples in this guide are shown as curl commands, but you may find it easier to work with the API by installing a REST client (for example, Insomnia). Before reading this guide, you may find it useful to understand the following: Versioning - The Portal API uses a version scheme that you can specify in the Accept header: Accept: application/vnd-skyscapecloud-v1 The examples in this guide use V1 of the API. As V1 is the default version, the examples don't explicitly set the API version. Accept headers - Within your API call, set the Accept header for the type of response you'd like returned: Accept: application/json - for a response in JSON format Accept: application/xml - for a response in XML format The examples in this guide accept JSON responses. As JSON is the default format, the examples don't explicitly set the response type. If you require XML responses, you must include the appropriate Accept header. You can add .json or .xml to the end of the API endpoint URL to override the Accept header. Authenticating to the API The Portal API uses session authentication. Before calling any of the API endpoints, you must first authenticate to the API. Send a POST request to the authenticate endpoint. Pass the following parameters in the request body: email - the email address you use to log in to the UKCloud Portal password - the password you use to log in to the UKCloud Portal For example: curl -c cookies.txt 'https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/authenticate' -X POST -d '{ \"email\": \"user@example.com\", \"password\": \"password\" }' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' If the authentication is successful, the endpoint returns a cookie that provides authentication for the next 900 seconds (15 minutes) and a response that tells you how long the session will last: {\"expire_after\":900} If the authentication is unsuccessful, the endpoint returns a 401 status code (Authentication Error). Using the Portal API to create a VDC The steps for creating a VDC are: Requesting a list of accounts Requesting a list of vOrgs Creating a VDC Requesting a list of accounts To create a VDC, you need to know the ID of the account in which you want to create it. If you need to find your account ID, send a GET request to the accounts endpoint to return a list of all your accounts. For example: curl -b cookies.txt 'https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/accounts' | json_pp If you need to authenticate to the Portal API first, see Authenticating to the API . The response lists the accounts associated with the email address you authenticated against. Find the account you want to work in and make a note of the account ID. In our example, we want to create a VDC in the account called My Account . The list of accounts returned by the API includes My Account and we can see that the ID of that account is 676 . [ ..., // other accounts filtered out { \"name\": \"My Account\", \"id\": 676 } ] Requesting a list of vOrgs Each account can have multiple vOrgs associated with it, so you also need to know the ID of the vOrg in which you want to create your new VDC. If you don't know the vOrg ID, send a GET request to the vorgs endpoint. If you need to authenticate to the Portal API first, see Authenticating to the API . Pass the following parameter in the request URL: account_id - the ID of the account in which you want to create your VDC For example: curl -b cookies.txt 'https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/accounts/676/vorgs/' | json_pp This returns a list of vOrgs associated with the specified account. A vOrg ID is made up of two numbers separated by a hyphen: the ID of the account to which the vOrg belongs and a number to identify the vOrg within the account. In our example, we want to create our VDC in the vOrg, My Org . We can see from the response to our API call that the vOrg ID we need is 676-2 . { \"data\": [ { \"id\": \"676-2\", \"type\": \"vOrg\", \"attributes\": { \"name\": \"My Org\" } } ] } Creating a VDC When you have the account and vOrg IDs, you can go ahead and create your VDC. Send a POST request to the vdcs endpoint. If you need to authenticate to the Portal API first, see Authenticating to the API . Pass the following parameters in the request URL: account_id - the ID of the account in which you want to create your VDC vorg_id - the unique number that identifies the vOrg in the account in which you want to create your VDC Pass the following parameters in the request body: type - you're creating a VDC, so the type is VDC vmType - the workload type of the VMs in the VDC: ESSENTIAL - VMs can have contended resource allocation; automated rebalancing is enabled to ensure the workload receives the requested performance POWER - VMs have uncontended compute resource allocation; automated rebalancing is enabled to pre-emptively optimise performance and availability PRIORITY - VMs have uncontended compute resource allocation; automated rebalancing is configured to reduce workload movement around the platform name - a name for the VDC; the name can be up to 32 characters long and can include any character except + For example: curl -b cookies.txt 'https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/accounts/676/vorgs/2/vdcs' -i -X POST -d '{ \"data\": { \"type\": \"VDC\", \"attributes\": { \"vmType\": \"POWER\", \"name\": \"My VDC\" } } }' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' Note Use the -i option in the request to view response headers so that you can see the Location header in the response. A successful response to this call includes information about the status of the build and a Location header that provides an address you can use to monitor the build process. The following example shows that the current state of the build is approved , meaning that the request to build the VDC was successful but the VDC creation process has not yet started. HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted ... Content-Type: application/json Location: /api/vdc-builds/9 ... { \"data\": { \"type\": \"VDC-build\", \"id\": \"9\", \"attributes\": { \"createdAt\": \"2016-07-28T14:16:11+01:00\", \"createdBy\": \"user@example.com\", \"state\": \"approved\" } } } Send a GET request to the vdc-builds endpoint to monitor the progress of the build. Pass the following parameter in the request URL: build_id - the ID of the build process In our example, the build ID is 9 , so we can send the following request: curl -b cookies.txt 'https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/vdc-builds/9' | json_pp If the build has started and is still in progress, the state changes to running . For example: { \"data\": { \"type\": \"VDC-build\", \"id\": \"9\", \"attributes\": { \"createdAt\": \"2016-07-28T14:16:11+01:00\", \"createdBy\": \"user\\@example.com\", \"state\": \"running\" } } } If the build has been completed and the VDC has been successfully created, the state changes to completed . For example: { \"data\": { \"type\": \"VDC-build\", \"id\": \"9\", \"attributes\": { \"createdAt\": \"2016-07-28T14:16:11+01:00\", \"createdBy\": \"user@example.com\", \"state\": \"completed\" } } } You have now created your VDC. Using the Portal API to create an edge gateway After creating your VDC, you need to create an edge gateway so that your users can access it. The steps for creating an edge gateway are: Finding the VDC URN Creating an edge gateway Finding the VDC URN The first thing you need to do is find the URN of the VDC for which you want to create the edge gateway. If you don't know the URN, send a GET request to the vdcs endpoint. If you need to authenticate to the Portal API first, see Authenticating to the API . Pass the following parameters in the request URL: account_id - the ID of the account to which the VDC belongs To find an account ID, see Requesting a list of accounts . vorg_id - the ID of the vOrg to which the VDC belongs To find a vOrg ID, see Requesting a list of vOrgs . For example: curl --b cookies.txt 'https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/accounts/676/vorgs/2/vdcs' | json_pp This returns a list of VDCs associated with the specified vOrg. In our example, we want to create an edge gateway for the VDC we just created ( My VDC ). We can see from the response to our API call that the URN we need is urn:vcloud:vdc:1a7570ea-29d9-4090-9714-75c262a123ad . { \"data\": [ { \"id\": \"urn:vcloud:vdc:1a7570ea-29d9-4090-9714-75c262a123ad\", \"type\": \"VDC\", \"attributes\": { \"name\": \"My VDC\" } }, { \"id\": \"urn:vcloud:vdc:f204dc27-c832-4aa5-9abd-19ca83fcfff1\", \"type\": \"VDC\", \"attributes\": { \"name\": \"Another VDC\" } } ] } Make a note of the VDC's full URN. You'll use this in the next step. Creating an edge gateway Now that you have your VDC URN, you can use the Portal API to create your edge gateway. Send a POST request to the edge-gateways endpoint. If you need to authenticate to the Portal API first, see Authenticating to the API . Pass the following parameters in the request URL: account_id - the ID of the account in which you want to create your edge gateway vorg_id - the unique number that identifies the vOrg in the account in which you want to create your edge gateway vdc_urn - the URN of the VDC for which you want to create the edge gateway Pass the following parameter in the request body: type - you're creating an edge gateway, so the type is EdgeGateway connectivityType - the type of connectivity the edge gateway provides into the VDC: Internet - in the Assured security domain External - in the Elevated security domain For example: curl -b cookies.txt -i 'https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/accounts/676/vorgs/2/vdcs/urn:vcloud:vdc:1a7570ea-29d9-4090-9714-75c262a123ad/edge-gateways' -X POST -d \\'{\\ \"data\": { \"type\": \"EdgeGateway\", \"attributes\": { \"connectivityType\": \"Internet\" } } }' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' As when you created your VDC, the response to this call includes a Location header with the build ID so that you can monitor the progress of the build. For example: HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted ... Content-Type: application/json Location: /api/edge-gateway-builds/10 { \"data\": { \"type\": \"EdgeGateway-build\", \"id\": \"10\", \"attributes\": { \"createdAt\": \"2016-07-28T16:41:47+01:00\", \"createdBy\": \"user@example.com\", \"state\": \"approved\" } } } After leaving some time for the edge gateway to be created, send a GET request to the edge-gateway-builds endpoint to check the progress of the build. Pass the following parameter in the request URL: build_id - the ID of the build process For example: curl -b cookies.txt 'https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/edge-gateway-builds/10' | json_pp when the edge gateway has been successfully created, the state changes to completed. For example: { \"data\": { \"type\": \"EdgeGateway-build\", \"id\": \"10\", \"attributes\": { \"createdAt\": \"2016-07-28T16:41:47+01:00\", \"createdBy\": \"user@example.com\", \"state\": \"completed\" } } } You have now created your edge gateway.

Areas of monitoring responsibility The diagram below shows a typical application stack and identifies the areas that can be monitored. The services below the red line on the diagram are monitored by us for both availability and performance (at a platform level). Incoming data is scanned and assessed, and any results outside of a defined threshold generates an alert inside our monitoring platform. Additional monitoring above the red line is the responsibility of the customer organisation. How does UKCloud monitor platform availability? We use a mixture of availability checks and synthetic transactions to monitor the availability of our platform. The platform level monitoring is provided at an aggregate level and does not check the availability of individual customer solutions. Technologies used We use single pane views of multiple technologies to monitor our platform. These include best of breed monitoring applications to: Monitor our cloud estate, including all core services and underlying hosts (in summary, all non-network devices). Monitor the underlying internal UKCloud infrastructure and core network devices. Monitor for potential Security Incidents 24 hours a day (Protective Monitoring, or ProMon), enabling us to benefit from industry leading detection and protection against security related incidents. This service is fully GPG13 (Good Practice Guide 13) compliant and is UK Government recommended. Details of systems and services monitored We monitor each individual component of the platform and then roll this data up into a single concise dashboard. This provides us with both RED and GREEN alerting systems at the component level and enables us to understand the overall health of a system. The list below provides a quick overview of how some of the key components of the UKCloud platform are monitored, which takes place across all services and both security domains (Assured and Elevated). UKCloud Portal UKCloud Portal (including transaction and performance tests) Synthetic login tests through the GUI and the Portal API. In depth monitoring of the web application layer, including page render and database access times. Multi-cloud services Cloud estate (including all core services and underlying hosts) Host CPU/memory stats Host connectivity status Host bandwidth throughput Host storage connectivity and throughput Core service status Underlying storage (including storage pools and storage performance) LUN capacity LUN status Data store connectivity Data store throughput Cloud management platform (including transaction and performance tests) Creation/deletion/modification of instances or groups of instances Multi-cloud enabling services Cloud Storage Infrastructure (including transaction and performance tests) What UKCloud monitors in your environment We do not monitor any individual component inside your environment. The table below outlines what we monitor inside and outside your environment, and what you can and should monitor: External connectivity (internet, PSN, HSCN, etc.) Network gateway Instance Storage Customer monitors Application performance Gateway state Gateway rules and activity VPN Instance management Instance performance Instance state Storage profiles UKCloud monitors Connection availability Bandwidth throughput Customer gateway availability and responsiveness Network availability Platform bandwidth Host availability Platform availability Platform performance Management plane availability Some management plane performance Platform availability Platform responsiveness and performance What can UKCloud provide, and what can you gain yourself?

    "keywords": "Upgrade to vCloud Director 8.20 Introduction This guide outlines the improvements UKCloud's upgrade to vCloud Director 8.20 will deliver. vCloud Director 8.20 new features After the upgrade to vCloud Director 8.20, you'll benefit from the following new features: Upgrade to NSX Edge - You'll be able to upgrade existing vCNS Edges to NSX Edges to take advantage of improved stability. Any new edge gateways will be NSX Edges by default. Convert to Advanced Gateway - You can convert your NSX Edges to advanced gateways, which provide access to additional functionality, such as the ability to manage SSL VPN users, as well as: New API NSX management - vCloud Director 8.20 introduces a new proxy API that enables vCloud API clients to make requests to the NSX API. Unlike the NSX API, which is designed to address NSX objects in a global scope, such as a vCenter database, the vCloud Director API for NSX is designed to address NSX objects within the scope of a vCloud Director tenant organisation. Note The API endpoint for configuring edge services will change, so any tooling that you use to amend the edge service configuration, such as adding firewall rules, will no longer work in its current state. NSX Tenant Portal - The Tenant Portal is a pure HTML5 user interface that you can use in conjunction with the legacy vCloud Director Web Console. This portal provides an initial set of controls to configure advanced gateway NSX Edges. Enable SSH on edge - If you enable SSH, you can perform your own packet captures and troubleshoot your edge gateway yourself, without having to contact UKCloud Support. Hardware version - vCloud Director 8.20 increases hardware version support. Guest OS support - vCloud Director 8.20 provides the first formal support for Windows 2016 64-bit. Changes to APIs For information about the changes to the vCloud API used by vCloud Director 8.20, see the vCloud API Schema Differences document in the VMware Documentation Center. For more information about using the advanced gateway API, see the vCloud Director API for NSX Programming Guide . vCloud API testing sandboxes UKCloud provides sandboxes to enable you to test the next two versions of the vCloud API so that you can prepare for future vCloud Director upgrades. If you require access to one of our vCloud sandboxes, raise a service request via My Calls on the UKCloud Portal. Known issues For a list of known issues with vCloud Director 8.20, see the vCloud Director 8.20 for Service Providers Release Notes .

    "title": "TW_REUSE and TW_RECYCLE settings | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "TW_REUSE and TW_RECYCLE settings Recent releases of the VMware edge gateway networking component have the TW_REUSE and TW_RECYCLEe settings enabled on all interfaces by default. When an edge is redeployed, the configuration reverts to these default settings. These settings are designed to reduce the amount of time TCP connections states are left open, following the cessation of user data traffic flowing across the socket. The reuse and recycle options differ slightly in their operation, with the recycle option being more problematic for devices behind NAT rules. Both of these settings involve a mechanism by which the TIME-WAIT state of the TCP connection is shortened, allowing the server in the client-server relationship (for example, your edge gateway load balancer) to regain ephemeral ports at a faster rate. TW_REUSE uses server-side time-stamps to allow the server to use a time-wait socket port number for outbound communications once the time-stamp is larger than the last received packet. The use of these time-stamps allows duplicate packets or delayed packets from the old connection to be discarded safely. TW_RECYCLE uses the same server-side time-stamps, however it affects both inbound and outbound connections. This is useful when the server is the first party to initiate connection closure. This allows a new client inbound connection from the source IP to the server. Due to this difference, it causes issues where client devices are behind NAT devices, as multiple devices attempting to contact the server may be unable to establish a connection until the Time-Wait state has aged out in its entirety. For a further explanation of the reuse and recycle settings, refer to the following link: http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/2014-tcp-time-wait-state-linux.html Due to the implementation of both of these settings by default, there are instances where TCP sockets are closed prematurely. This is particularly noticeable where a large amount of NAT rules or Load balancers are configured on the edge gateway, with moderate to high traffic throughput. Depending on how the client application layer is designed to handle such interruptions in network layer communications, this may manifest to end users as application hangs or crashes. These settings can be configured by customers with the appropriate permissions through My VMs > Edge Gateway > System Control Settings.

    "keywords": "UK keyboard layout not supported in Web Console Issue The web-based console available in the vCloud Director 9.1 HTML5 UI (tenant portal) does not provide support for a UK English keyboard layout, only US English. This means that when interacting with the console using a UK keyboard, the keys you press on the keyboard may not work as expected in the console. For example, if you press the @ key on your keyboard, this may appear in the console as a \" symbol. Solution VMware are aware of this issue and currently plan to address it in vCloud Director 9.7. We will continue to monitor the issue and will let you know if it is addressed any sooner. In the meantime, the lack of support for the UK keyboard should not cause issues with entering commands in the console. However if you do encounter issues, you can use the VM Remote Console instead. To use the console you'll need to download an application (available for Windows, Linux and Mac) to the local PC client (requires VMware account). Note The VM Remote Console in vCloud Director 9.1 is different from the VMRC used in previous versions of vCloud Director and does not require the client integration plugin, which previously caused issues with browser limitations. In the vCloud Director Virtual Datacenters dashboard, select your VDC. In the left navigation panel, click Virtual Machines . In the card for your VM, select More , then Download VMRC . Click the Download button for the version of the console you want to download (Windows, Mac or Linux). At this point, you'll need to login to your VMware account. Note If you do not have a VMware account, they are free to create, or you can contact UKCloud Support and we'll make the VMRC installer file available to you. Run the VM Remote Console installer then restart vCloud Director. In the card for your VM, select More , then Launch VM Remote Console . The VM Remote Console works correctly with a UK keyboard. Note There is a current bug that occasionally reports that the VM Remote Console is not installed. If you see this message, and you have installed the console, it should still open normally.

    "title": "Private Cloud for Compute FAQs | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Private Cloud for Compute FAQs Service What is the service? Private Cloud for Compute is a single-tenant UKCloud for VMware service, where your compute requirements are hosted either in one of our data centres, to gain the benefits of our Assured and Elevated cloud platforms; or in your Crown Hosting Data Centre (CHDC); powered by VMware vCloud Director or OpenStack. How does Private Cloud for Compute differ from UKCloud for VMware? Private Cloud for Compute provides you with dedicated infrastructure - the compute infrastructure is designed for the exclusive use of each customer, and provides the highest levels of separation and isolation from other customers. This service differs from UKCloud for VMware in that it also allows you to have more flexibility in the size of your VMs. What backup/disaster recovery options do I get? You can choose between two protection levels: Automated VM backup - providing protection in one data centre Site replication and failover - providing remote protection in a second data centre Where will my data be physically stored? Your data will be stored in our highly resilient, UK-sovereign tier 3 data centres, which are separated by over 100km. How much data can I store? A core benefit of Private Cloud for Compute is that it can scale to meet the most demanding compute requirements. Management How do I access my environment? You can access your VMs using: The remote console through the UKCloud Portal Remote access protocols (such as RDP/SSH) over a VPN or secure network Documentation on ways to interact with the platform is available from the UKCloud Knowledge Centre. Support How do I raise a support ticket? UKCloud's secure online Portal provides the most common service management functionality. Alternatively, you can contact support by phone or email. How do I manage my services? Private Cloud for Compute on the Assured OFFICIAL (formerly IL2) domain can be managed over the internet via the UKCloud Portal. For the Elevated OFFICIAL (formerly IL3) domain, the security requirements are much stricter and require either a PSN-approved connection, UKCloud Secure Remote Access, or CAPS-approved encryption. What are your service maintenance windows? As far as possible, planned maintenance of UKCloud's infrastructure takes place between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Sunday, or between the hours of 08:00 and 12:00 (UK local time) on a Saturday or Sunday. We provide customers with at least 14 days' advance notice of planned maintenance. As far as possible, emergency maintenance of UKCloud's infrastructure takes place between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Sunday, or between the hours of 08:00 and 12:00 (UK local time) on Saturday or Sunday, unless there is an identified and demonstrable immediate risk to a customer's environment. Whenever possible, we provide customers with at least six hours' advance notice of emergency maintenance. Onboarding How can I get started with the service? On acceptance of your order, we'll work with you to create a detailed design for your Private Cloud - Compute service. The design will formalise the dedicated components required for your solution. If this is a new service for you, we will create your primary administrator account and send you a welcome pack, which includes the URL for the UKCloud Portal for access to the Knowledge Centre and service management function. Billing and legal What is the smallest unit of time I will be billed for? Billing depends on the packaging option chosen - the smallest option for this service is monthly. Please note, this service is offered under a 24-month minimum term commitment. How can I pay for the services? Service charges are billed monthly in arrears. In addition, there will be initial upfront charges, which vary depending on the pricing model selected. Payment can be made by direct bank transfer (BACS/CHAPS). How can I view billing information? Billing information is available via the UKCloud Portal. What are the termination fees? An early exit charge will be payable if the contract is terminated before the end of its original term. Customers are responsible for extracting their data from the platform if required. UKCloud may make an additional charge for transferring data out of the service. Is there a free trial? Owing to the dedicated, single-tenant nature of this service, no trials are available. Security What data is suitable for our cloud? The service is hosted in the UK and operated by SC-cleared staff. It has extensive independent validation (including CESG design reviews) that it is fully aligned with NCSC Cloud Security Principles, and is therefore ideal for all data classified at OFFICIAL (including OFFICIAL SENSITIVE). Can systems on different UKCloud platforms communicate with one another? UKCloud's Cross Domain Security Zone allows customers to use the UKCloud-defined and managed Guard, or a customer-designed and managed Walled Garden, to enable communication between platforms.

    "keywords": "Portal user access For all customers in the UKCloud Portal there is a concept of companies, business accounts and services, which allows for different levels of segregation. When a customer starts using UKCloud's Portal, we create the initial administrator username that enables access prior to any customer data or systems being provisioned on our platforms. Security of our services is paramount and we provide the facilities to enable customers to manage user access; this is also because we have no means of verifying the identity, roles and access rights of an individual user. Administrator responsibilities Customers need to allocate administrators who are responsible for: Adding and deleting new user accounts Maintaining the appropriate permissions and access for users Activating and locking individual user accounts where required Resetting passwords and memorable words Ensuring that only appropriate users are listed as administrators To avoid a situation where all administrators are unable to access services, UKCloud recommends that each customer assigns multiple administrators and ensures that memorable words are maintained. UKCloud Support There are a number of Access Management activities which UKCloud can assist with. These are: Enabling access to multiple business accounts for individual users. This can be provided through a Service Request raised by a user from the business account for which access will be enabled. VPN set up on a secondary vShield Edge. Customers are able to configure and manage an edge gateway VPN on their primary edge gateway; however where a secondary edge gateway is used, UKCloud will assist in establishing the VPN and administering VPN accounts and passwords. Customers can also choose to install and self-manage an alternative VPN product. Password reset and account unlock for an administrator. In this scenario the administrator will need to provide details from their memorable word. UKCloud Support will send credentials to the telephone number registered to the administrator's user account. Provide a listing of user account permissions. We recognise that customers may wish to undertake an audit of the permissions of Portal users. Permission for each user are visible under Contacts and we can also provide an extract of these. Password reset In the event that you need to reset your password: For the Assured OFFICIAL Portal, a self-service facility is available from the log on page. Alternatively your administrator can change your password or memorable word. For the Elevated OFFICIAL Portal, your password or memorable word will need to be changed by your administrator.

    "keywords": "Making the most of your UKCloud for OpenShift trial Overview Welcome to your UKCloud for OpenShift trial. Your trial OpenShift cluster is a secure, single-tenant private deployment on UKCloud's Assured OpenStack cloud, avoiding any noisy neighbour issues. During an OpenShift trial the OpenShift cluster is typically only connected to the internet, however connectivity to many other government community networks is available in OpenShift clusters after the trial phase. The purpose of an OpenShift trial is for you to get hands-on experience with Red Hat™ OpenShift container orchestration technology to see if this is the correct technology for you. Intended audience This article is intended for developers who have signed up for an OpenShift trial with UKCloud. Developers are expected to have a good understanding of containerisation and container orchestration technologies to maximise their benefit from an OpenShift trial. Introduction to UKCloud for OpenShift trials OpenShift provides a platform-as-a-service, which means that you don't need to worry about the underlying hardware or operating system. Instead, you can focus on developing, deploying, scaling and monitoring your applications in OpenShift, maximising your return on investment in terms of money and time. With UKCloud for OpenShift, you have administrator access to your cluster, giving you the control you need to create, deploy and administer your environment as you see fit. All OpenShift deployments get a Foundation Pack, which includes the management and orchestration planes. These are essentially three master nodes, two infrastructure nodes and load balancers for the control and data planes. During a trial, each cluster is also provisioned with two small Runtime Packs. These are essentially two OpenStack VMs running RedHat Atomic OS with 16GB RAM, 2vCPUs and 100GB disks each. This is also the minimum number of Runtime Packs UKCloud recommends in each OpenShift deployment in order to provide minimal resilience and enable interruption free patching. After the trial phase it is possible to deploy larger and more nodes for your cluster. OpenShift documentation: Architecture GUI and CLI Access To access the OpenShift cluster GUI, you need an internet-enabled device running an HTML5-capable browser. You will also be set up for access to the UKCloud Portal and given the relevant access to your OpenShift deployment. OpenShift documentation: Web Console Walkthrough In addition to GUI access, you can also access OpenShift through the CLI. To do this, you need to install the oc client on your machines. To avoid any compatibility issues please install the same version of the oc client as your OpenShift cluster. OpenShift documentation: Installing the OC CLI Storage Each trial deployment has a block storage quota of 2TB across either Tier 1 or Tier 2 storage. This is enforced at the OpenStack project layer. This storage is available to the projects you create within OpenShift and you can consume the storage by creating Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) for your applications. It is good practice to use PVCs for any persistent storage requirements as any data stored within local volumes will be lost when pods are moved from one node to another; for example as a result of node evacuations during patching. You can increase your storage quotas by creating a service request in the UKCloud Portal. OpenShift is deployed with an internal image registry making use of UKCloud's object storage service for persistence. This includes 60GB of free storage capacity which does not consume your 2TB block storage quota; rather this is in addition to the 2TB data limit. UKCloud do provision an Elasticsearch, Fluentd and Kibana stack which uses 40GB, Hawkular Metrics backed by a Cassandra database which uses 10GB and the Prometheus Operator which uses 106GB of Tier 2 storage (which consumes some of the 2TB storage limit). Image Security You should take care when creating your container images to ensure the images do not run as root. You should set up containers to run as a user who has just enough rights to run the container workload.

    "keywords": "How to obtain usage metrics to use for OpenShift capacity management Overview This article provides examples of the self-service commands you can execute against your UKCloud for OpenShift cluster to gain usage metrics and statistics to help manage your ongoing capacity requirements. A UKCloud deployed OpenShift cluster comprises a single Starter Pack, plus a number of Runtime Packs as required by your workload demands. Starter Pack - Provides the foundation OpenShift services to support the orchestration and management of the container runtime environments, along with additional infrastructure nodes to support services such as log aggregation and metric collection. Each customer environment requires only a single Starter Pack. Runtime Pack - Nodes on which your containerised applications and services run. You have the choice of difference size Runtime Packs. You can call off Runtime Packs individually, however, we strongly recommend the initial deployment of two or more Runtime Packs for production environments to provide resilience to your workloads in the event of the failure of a single Runtime Pack. To add or remove Runtime Packs, raise a Service Request via the UKCloud Portal. The sections in this guide, show you how to obtain various statistics about the platform, including: Overall status of each node in the cluster Uptime per node CPU usage Memory usage Block storage consumption (used by persistent volumes) Object storage consumption (used by the registry) Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have access to and a working knowledge of oc , the OpenStack command-line client (CLI). For more information, see OpenShift's Get Started with the CLI . Identifying capacity statistics The OpenStack CLI provides the ability to list the nodes in your cluster and then retrieve status information about a specific node. You can use this information to determine if the nodes in your cluster have enough available disk space and memory. To obtain the list of nodes that make up the OpenStack cluster, enter the following command: oc get nodes The results show you the overall readiness of each node and how long they've been running. For example: To find the detailed status of a node, enter the following command: oc describe node <nodename> The results show a large amount of information about disk status (pressure and out-of-disk), memory pressure and usage, CPU usage and resource consumption from any running pods. For example: You can also obtain some of the above information via the REST API, by using something like: curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $token\" -H 'Accept: application/json' https://ocp.\\$clustername:8443/api/v1/nodes For more information about accessing this data, see How to monitor your OpenShift cluster . Identifying block storage consumption For capacity management, it's also useful to know much block storage your cluster is using. To obtain block storage consumption (persistent volumes) information, enter the following command: oc get pv The results will look similar to the following, where we can see there is one item consuming 50 GB of storage. Identifying object storage consumption Object storage is used only for the OpenShift registry, therefore, you can calculate how much object storage your cluster is using by adding up the resources in the registry. To obtain information about resources in the registry, enter the following two commands: oc adm top imagestreams oc adm top images The output from these commands will look something like the following: Note For the oc adm top command to work, Hawkular must be running in your cluster. This command can also report on nodes and pods. The appendix at the end of this guide provides some sample Python code to sum the sizes of resources from these two oc adm top commands. Other monitoring options You can find a simple example of a custom monitoring application, using the REST API described above, in How to monitor your OpenShift cluster and as a UKCloud blog post . You can also perform monitoring using Hawkular, which is built into the product. You can access Hawkular from the browser-based console at: https://ocp.<your-deployment-name>.cna.ukcloud.com:8443 Or directly at: https://hawkular-metrics.<your-deployment-name>.cna.ukcloud.com/hawkular/metrics Next steps Further cluster capacity management options are discussed at: https://blog.openshift.com/full-cluster-capacity-management-monitoring-openshift Appendix - Example code for adding up storage contents You can use the following code to add up the values from oc adm top . #!/usr/bin/env python3 \"\"\" Add up storage values. oc adm top imagestreams gives us storage usage for each storage use for each imagestream, and oc adm top images gives us the same for images Storage is suffixed with 'MiB' or 'GiB', so each value needs converting to a number before we can add them up.

    "keywords": "How to monitor your OpenShift cluster Overview UKCloud for OpenShift enables you to develop, deploy, and manage digital and container-based applications seamlessly across local physical or virtual environments, with full portability to and from UKCloud. This guide explains how you can set up a simple system to monitor an OpenShift cluster. Intended audience This guide assumes familiarity with the Linux command line, and with the oc command set to manage an OpenShift cluster. Prerequisites To complete the steps in this guide, you must have the oc command installed and have a suitable account on your OpenShift cluster. Specifically, it is assumed you know the authentication credentials that need to be supplied to oc login. Generating an authentication token The first step is to create a service account within your OpenShift cluster that your monitoring system can use, and create an authentication token for it. Tip The token may have already been created, so it's worth checking first. Log in to OpenShift on the command line: oc login ... oc project openshift-infra Check if a monitoring account already exists: oc get serviceaccount --all-namespaces | grep infra | \\ grep monitoring If the account exists, the command above prints the name, and you can move on to Reading the authentication token . If it prints nothing, you need to create the account as described in the remaining steps below. Create the monitoring account if it does not exist: oc create serviceaccount monitoring Add the role cluster-reader to the account: oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-reader \\ system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:monitoring Reading the authentication token Next, you need to retrieve the authentication token that you created in the previous step. If you haven't already done so, ensure you are logged in to OpenShift and connected to the right project: oc login ... oc project openshift-infra Find the name of the monitoring account's token IDs: oc describe serviceaccount monitoring This lists the IDs of one or more token names, for example, monitoring-token-1abc2 . Find the actual authentication token by querying the secret by the name given in the previous step, for example: oc describe secret <monitoring-token> Where monitoring-token is the token name you found in the previous step. This lists a few values, including the 179-character authentication token. Using the authentication token The OpenShift API provides a way of determining the health of the cluster; the data required to do this is obtainable by requesting the API at /api/vi/nodes . You must supply the authentication token in the HTTP Authorization header. The following example shows how to query this data from a shell command using curl. $ token=\"<authentication_token>\" $ endpoint= https://ocp.<my-cluster-url>.ukcloud.com:8443 $ curl -k -H \"Authorization: Bearer ${token}\" \\ -H 'Accept: application/json' ${endpoint}/api/v1/nodes You'll need to customise the query above by providing the correct values for endpoint and token. This API call returns a reasonable amount of JSON-encoded data, which may be hard to parse using shell commands. It's also necessary to fetch items from various places within this data. The Python program in the following section shows you how to accomplish this. Using the OpenShift API to obtain cluster status The code example below uses the OpenShift API to obtain information about the health of the cluster, and prints a summary showing if each node is healthy. #!/usr/bin/env python3 import urllib.request import json import ssl def get_all_nodes(endpoint, token): \"\"\"Fetch the nodes data from the openshift cluster\"\"\" request = urllib.request.Request(endpoint + \"/api/v1/nodes\") request.add_header('Authorization', 'Bearer ' + token) request.add_header('Accept', 'application/json') ssl_context = None # or ssl._create_unverified_context() result = urllib.request.urlopen(request, context=ssl_context) return result.read() def get_status_from_node(data_item): \"\"\" Extract the status conditions from the data\"\"\" addresses = data_item['status']['addresses'] address = None for addr in addresses: if addr['type'] == 'Hostname': address = addr['address'] return {'hostname': address, 'conditions': data_item['status']['conditions']} def find_faults(cond_data): \"\"\" find whether each node is in a failed state\"\"\" cells = [] for node in cond_data: hostname = node['hostname'] state = 'OK ' for cond in node['conditions']: if cond['status'] != \"False\" and cond['type'] != \"Ready\": state = 'FAIL' elif cond['status'] != \"True\" and cond['type'] == \"Ready\": state = 'FAIL' cells.append('{} {} '.format(state, hostname)) return cells def main(): all_nodes = json.loads(get_all_nodes(ENDPOINT, TOKEN)) all_conditions = [] for node in all_nodes['items']: all_conditions.append(get_status_from_node(node)) print(\"Status of Cluster at {}\".format(ENDPOINT)) for node in find_faults(all_conditions): print(node) ENDPOINT = 'https://ocp.my-cluster-url.ukcloud.com:8443' TOKEN = 'eyJhb...the.179.char.token' main() Tip If you encounter problems copying and pasting the source code above, we also provide the code in the following blog post: https://ukcloud.com/hub/news/simple-openshift-monitoring/ Next steps For more information about UKCloud for OpenShift service, see: Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for OpenShift UKCloud for OpenShift FAQs Feedback If you find an issue with this article, click Improve this Doc to suggest a change.

    "title": "Troubleshooting Migration to the Cloud | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Troubleshooting Migration to the Cloud (powered by Zerto) Overview This guide describes some of the issues you may encounter when using UKCloud's Workload Migration to the Cloud service: Starting a test failover takes a long time RPO alerts and bitmap syncing Recovery storage errors and journal size alerts during test failovers Test failover VMs do not perform as expected Live failover does not perform the same as test failover Important During the failover process, any change in the configuration or state of the live or failed‑over VMs (for example, power on or power off) will cause failure of the failover and may corrupt the VPG. This could make a full resync necessary. Starting a test failover takes a long time Cause When you initiate a test failover, Zerto creates VMs in vCloud (referred to as testing recovery VMs) and then performs further tasks to provide the correct data for those VMs to boot from. VM creation and other operations in vCloud unavoidably take some time, therefore when performing a simultaneous failover of many VMs, it can be a while before the VMs are powered on and ready for use. Zerto automatically powers on the testing recovery VMs when it has completed the operations necessary to make the correct data available to the VMs. Powering on a VM prematurely will cause it to be corrupted and will impact live replication. Additionally, manually powering-off a testing recovery VM will cause live replication to stop; testing recovery VMs must remain powered on for the duration of the test failover. Solution If you're failing over many VMs simultaneously, you should anticipate that it will take some time before the VMs are powered on and ready for use. Important Do not manually power on or power off recovery VMs during a failover. Doing so will corrupt the VPG. RPO alerts and bitmap syncing Cause Some application and database servers have a high change rate. Limited VPN bandwidth from the on-premises sites means that often changes to the live VMs occur faster than the rate of replication. Solution For workload migration, the increased recovery point objecting (RPO) is not a concern. We recommend that, unless there are specific reasons otherwise, you set the priority of your Workload Migration to the Cloud VPGs to Medium to ensure that all VPGs replicate fairly compared to each other. Recovery storage errors and journal size alerts during test failovers Cause Due to the way that testing recovery VMs are instantiated, Zerto is unable to flush the oldest journal entries into the base recovery disks while a test failover is in progress. This means that the journal size continuously grows while the test failover is in progress, at a rate dependant on the change rate of the live VM. This will cause alerts when the journal reaches 75% of its maximum size. When the journal reaches 100% of its maximum size, replication of the live VM stops since there is nowhere to place new checkpoints. At this point, the VPG will show a state of Recovery Storage Error and will be required to perform a lengthy sync when the test failover is stopped. Solution For workload migration, the gaps in replication that result from this problem may be acceptable, so it is likely that you can ignore these alerts during test failovers. Additionally, you will see Recovery Storage Error and other transient errors in the Zerto console while a test failover is in the process of starting; you can ignore these in all cases. Test failover VMs do not perform as expected Cause Testing recovery VMs (and live failed-over VMs before they are committed) do not run from normal virtual disks. To remove the need to fully clone all data, when Zerto does a test failover (or a live failover before committing), it creates a simulated view onto the VM's disks at the checkpoint time you select. All reads from the disks are intercepted by Zerto's ESXi kernel driver and then processed with reference to the journal to ensure that the correct data for that checkpoint's point-in-time is returned. Additionally, any writes made to the testing recovery VM are diverted to a temporary file. While the test failover is in progress, Zerto is unable to flush the oldest journal checkpoints into the base VMDK disks in order to preserve the integrity of the replicated base disks and journals. Solution Zerto test failovers are intended to give confidence that the data on the VM disks is being correctly replicated. We recommend that you should not use test failover VMs for detailed application testing for the following reasons: If the test failover goes on too long, new changes from the live VM will cause the journal to fill, halting replication of the live VM A large volume of writes to the testing recovery VMs will cause those VMs to fail Storage performance of the testing recovery VMs is very poor, potentially up to 50% slower than native performance These issues are also applicable to live failovers that have not yet been committed. When the commit operation is completed, the resulting VMs are running from normal VMDK files and are no longer subject to these problems. When performing a live failover, we recommend that: You stop the applications on the on-premises site VMs before triggering the failover. This ensures that the application state is consistent at the point of failover and will avoid Recovery Storage Errors due to the journal filling while the VPG is in a live Failover Before Commit state. Do not perform any application testing on the failed-over VMs that might cause too much new data to be written to the VM's disks before commit. Plan to complete the commit operation during the outage window for the migration. Additionally, you should consider the following during a live failover: We do not recommend the use of auto commit; this option causes the commit to occur automatically after the failover is initiated. Do not enable reverse replication unless you fully understand all the potential implications of doing so. Enabling reverse replication causes the VMDK disks of the source VMs to be altered to seed the reverse replication. The VPGs in Zerto enter a Needs Configuration state after the failover is committed. We recommend that you delete the VPGs from Zerto at this stage to ensure reverse replication cannot be configured accidently. If reverse replication isn't enabled, the source VMs will remain untouched (even post-commit) to serve as a worst-case recovery option if the migration doesn't go to plan. It's likely that the live failover (excluding the commit operation) will take a similar length of time as a test failover. The commit operation converts the failed-over VMs into normal vCloud VMs not subject to the limitations inherent to test failover (or live failover before commit) VMs. The commit operation is performed while the VMs (on the UKCloud side) remain running and will take several hours (dependant on the size and change-rate of the live VM). Live failover does not perform the same as test failover Cause In the current version of Zerto, live failovers typically take longer to start that test failovers. Also, features such as guest customization behave differently during a live failover. Solution Before a migration, we recommend that you trigger a live failover as a practice ahead of time so that you can accurately predict timescales and behaviour. When you can confirm that the failed-over VPGs are in a Failover Before Commit state, you should roll back this failover (rather than commit it). If Shutdown [live] VMs and Auto Commit are not selected (and you do not manually commit the failover), the practice failover should not affect live VMs. In all cases, you should take care to understand any networking implications of performing a practice live failover ahead of time.

    "keywords": "How to migrate your workloads to the UKCloud platform Overview UKCloud makes it easy for you to seamlessly migrate your existing workloads from a local VMware or Hyper-V powered data centre to our cloud platform. Our workload migration service is powered by Zerto, a leading provider of disaster recovery software for the cloud. Intended audience This guide is intended for users who want to migrate their workloads onto the UKCloud platform. Before you begin When you request Workload Migration, UKCloud provides you with: The IP address (from the IP range you provided to UKCloud) of the Zerto Cloud Connector (ZCC) deployed in your target VDC; you'll need this to complete the setup of the site-to-site VPN between your local environment and your UKCloud target VDC A link to the appropriate version of the Zerto Virtual Manager (ZVM) for you to deploy in your local environment A ZORG ID to identify your Zerto environment within the UKCloud platform Access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal (ZSSP) in the appropriate UKCloud zone You should consider the following: VMs must be powered on to be synchronised The operating system used by the source VMs must also be supported in the target site System requirements To use our Workload Migration service, you must have a valid, centrally managed vSphere or HyperV estate. A single hypervisor is not sufficient. The following table lists the minimum requirements for Workload Migration, based on the currently deployed version of Zerto Virtual Replication (4.5U4) on the UKCloud platform: Product Supported version Management plane VMware vCenter 4.0U1 -- 6.0U2 Microsoft SCVMM 2012 R2 and Server Core: Update Rollup 6-11 (recommended) 2012 R2 and Server Core: RTM Hosts VMWare ESX/ESXi 4.0U1-4.0U3, 4.0U4 , 4.1-6.0U1, 6.0U2 Microsoft Hyper-V 2012 R2 and Server Core Virtual Machines Hardware Version VMware Up to Version 10 Hyper-V Generation 1&2 VM migration service Connectivity Full Duplex internet connection 5Mb/s minimum IPsec VPN NA For a complete list of hypervisor features supported when using Workload Migration, see: http://s3.amazonaws.com/zertodownload_docs/4.5U4/Zerto%20Virtual%20Replication%20Operability%20Matrix.pdf Migrating workloads to UKCloud Create a target VDC Set up your local environment Configure networking on the target site Create a virtual protection group Migrate your workloads Create a target VDC To migrate your workloads to the UKCloud platform, you must have a VDC in the intended target site. If you already have a compute service in the UKCloud site, you can use an existing VDC or you can create a new one using: The UKCloud Portal (for more information see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware ) The UKCloud Portal API (for more information see the How to use the UKCloud Portal API ) If you don't already have a compute service in the UKCloud site or you'd prefer UKCloud to create the VDC for you, you can request this as part of your Workload Migration Service Request. Set up your local environment Before you can start migrating your workloads to UKCloud, you need to prepare your local environment by: Installing the appropriate version of Zerto Virtual Manager (ZVM) in your local environment Creating a secure site-to-site VPN between your local environment and the UKCloud platform For more information, see How to install and configure Zerto in your local environment . Configure networking on the target site You must configure any internally and externally routed networks in your UKCloud target VDC to duplicate those in your local environment. You must also configure the edge gateway with the same firewall, NAT and other rules. You'll create the mapping between these networks when you create your VPG. When you migrate your workloads, external access to the UKCloud VDC will be via a different IP address. You'll need to account for any required DNS changes and external connectivity configuration (such as VPNs), to ensure continued external access. Utilising UKCloud's VMware cloud, you can configure this in advance. Alternatively, you can use load balancing technologies to manage a seamless switch between environments. Create a virtual protection group A virtual protection group (VPG) is a collection of VMs that are grouped together for migration. When you create a VPG, a replica of each VM disk is created on the target UKCloud site. These replica virtual disks are then populated with the data in the source VMs by synchronising the source VMs with the target site replicas. For more information, see How to create a virtual protection group . Migrate your workloads Within Zerto, you have two options for migrating your workloads: Move the VPG to the target site. This method performs an end-to-end migration, including removing the VMs from the source site after they have been moved. For more information, see the steps below. Perform a live failover. This method provides more flexibility for you to control what happens on the source site after you move the VMs to the target site. For more information, see How to perform a failover . To move a VPG: Login to ZSSP. If you need more detailed instructions, see How to access the Zerto Self-Service Portal . Use the ZSSP login link for the zone in which your target VDC is located. From the ACTIONS menu at the bottom of the page, choose MOVE VPG . In the Move wizard, on the Select VPGs page, select one or more VPGs that you want to move then click NEXT . On the EXECUTION PARAMETERS page, the commit policy gives you the opportunity to check the integrity of the migrated VMs before committing the move. To change the commit policy, select the Commit Policy field and choose: Auto-Commit if you want to automatically commit the move after a specified amount of time if there is no user interaction. Set the amount of time in the After field, up to a maximum of 1440 minutes (24 hours). If you want the move to be immediately committed, enter 0. Auto-Rollback if you want to automatically roll back the move after a specified amount of time if there is no user interaction. Set the amount of time in the After field, up to a maximum of 1440 minutes (24 hours). If you want the move to be immediately rolled back, enter 0. None if you do not want to apply a commit policy. You must manually commit or roll back the move. The source VMs must be powered off before they can be migrated. If the VMs cannot be gracefully shut down, you can force a shutdown. To force shutdown, select the Force Shutdown check box. If you do not select this option and the VMs cannot be gracefully shut down, the move process fails. Reverse protection ensures that when the source VMs are migrated to the target site, the source site becomes the new target site. Reverse protection is enabled by default, but you can disable it by clicking the Reverse Protection field and deselecting the REVERSE check box. Click NEXT . On the MOVE page, review the diagram to see the number of VPGs and VMs included in the move and where they will be moved to, then click START MOVE . The move process creates the VMs in the target site. Note If a VM already exists on the target site with the same name as one of the source VMs, a number is added to the end of the target VM name to ensure that it is unique. If you set a commit policy with a time greater than zero, you can check the integrity of the migrated VMs before committing (or rolling back) the migration. When you've finished testing, you can either wait for the time to elapse before the auto commit or auto rollback, or on the VPGs tab, click the VPG Name and then click the Commit or Rollback icon as required. After the migrated VMs are up and running and committed in the target site, the powered off VMs in the source site are removed from the source site and data from the journal is promoted to the migrated VMs. If you enabled reverse protection, the migrated VMs are protected on the source site. Next steps To see what you can do with your application now that it's on the UKCloud platform, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware . If you used failover to migrate your workloads, when you've determined that the migration has been successful, you should remove the original VMs from the source site to remove any workloads that are no longer required.

    "keywords": "Disaster Recovery as a Service Service Scope About this document This document explains what is and isn't included in the scope of our Disaster Recovery as a Service service. Disaster Recovery as a Service provides a seamless way to failover from your own data centre to the UKCloud for VMware service. You can use this service as part of your own business continuity or disaster recovery processes. With this service, you're charged for the amount of data that you're protecting and are only charged for VMs when they are powered on during a live or test failover. About Disaster Recovery as a Service Disaster Recovery as a Service is a powerful, self-service replication and recovery tool that can improve organisational resilience and enable seamless migration of applications between your local VMware or Hyper-V powered data centre and UKCloud's disaster recovery enabled regions. This means that, in the event of a VM being compromised such as a local hardware failure, a power outage or security incidents such as theft or WAN connectivity disruption, you can quickly recover your VMs to the UKCloud platform and ensure that the disruption to your service is minimised. Once configured, you can protect VMs by adding them to a virtual protection group (VPG). Each VM in the VPG is synchronised to your recovery site on UKCloud, and a journal is created. After this initial sync, each subsequent write operation to the VM is processed as normal on your site and a copy is asynchronously sent to the recovery site and written to the journal. When the specified journal history length is reached (for example, 14 days), as new journal entries are created, older entries are written to the recovery VM's virtual disks. Every few seconds, a checkpoint is written to every journal for each VM in the VPG to ensure crash-consistency between the VMs. If you need to recover your VMs, you select a checkpoint to recover to. For example, in the case of a virus you could recover to a checkpoint from before the virus attack. During recovery, the VMs are created on the recovery site and the recovery disks for each VM are attached to the recovered VM. Information in the journal is then promoted to the VM to bring it up to the date and time of the selected checkpoint. Note that each VPG recovered into the recovery site will appear as a vApp within UKCloud. Customers Responsibilities Given the nature of this service, with part of the solution hosted on your site, you are responsible for the following: Your environment must meet the minimum specification required by the solution (that you can find here ). This covers software versions, limitations around the types of VMs that can be protected and the minimum WAN connectivity speeds Installation and configuration of Zerto components including the ZVM (Zerto Virtual Manager) and ZRA (Zerto Replication Appliance) Creation of a VPN to connect to UKCloud Ensuring that the local instances of Zerto are upgraded to remain compatible with the current version utilised by UKCloud. You will be notified via the notifications section on the UKCloud Portal when the version is upgraded on the UKCloud platform Local network tuning and firewall configurations We'll work with you to help you identify if any issues encountered are within your estate or on the UKCloud platform. You are responsible for troubleshooting issues within your own estate. If you require support managing your local Zerto installation, we have a wide ecosystem of partners that can assist. Frequency and timing UKCloud's Disaster Recovery as a Service is designed to provide recovery points that are as little as seconds behind the running VM. Our standard profile provides: Target RPO of 5 minutes Journal history of 2, 7, 14 or 28 days At present, we've not enabled the ability for you to configure custom profiles. If the target RPO is exceeded, you and UKCloud will be notified via the Zerto Self-Service Portal. Factors that can affect the RPO are: Rate of change of the data on a VM. VMs with a large rate of change in the data will potentially achieve a slightly longer RPO than VMs that have a lower rate of change Any network latency or storage performance challenges. We monitor our estate to ensure that network and storage performance are in line with platform expectations. Any deviations are alerted to our technical teams to resolve. WAN network performance. Low throughput WAN connections are unlikely to be able to transfer large amounts of data to UKCloud. This can make initial sync challenging for larger VMs. Additionally, the service raises an alert if the size of a VM's journal exceeds 75% of the original VM. This alert helps to understand if your solution is adequately protected. Disaster Recovery as a Service captures data only while a VM is powered on. If a VM is deleted in vCloud Director, it will IMMEDIATELY delete the associated journal. What SLA do you offer on Disaster Recovery as a Service? We don't offer an SLA around the VMs protected by our Disaster Recovery as a Service. However, the status of VMs is monitored continuously, and the UKCloud support team investigates all failures or service degradation. Other The service is not backed by service credits. On occasion, planned maintenance may disrupt the operation of the Disaster Recovery as a Service. This may lead to the service being unavailable, or a temporary increase to the RPO you may be able to achieve on the platform. If there's a potential disruption, we'll highlight this to you via the service status page and UKCloud Portal notifications system. Disaster Recovery as a Service management You can self-manage your protected environment via the Zerto Self-Service Portal. This portal enables you to: Configure virtual protection groups Opt VMs into the VPGs Monitor the performance of your platform View the current RPO of your applications and current available history Perform test failovers Perform live failovers We've disabled some areas of the Zerto Self-Service Portal as they're for services we don't presently support. These include: Backup to external systems. At present, you cannot export your journal to external backup targets (such as UKCloud Cloud Storage). We've identified a compliance issue with this solution which we're working to address. Until this is addressed, the feature will remain unavailable. Additionally, the following scenarios cannot be protected: VMs with virtual disks with individual disks greater than 3TB VMs which are clustered using shared virtual disks Alerting and reporting The Zerto Self-Service Portal provides live real-time reporting of your solution and the current level of protection being provided to your VMs. The portal also raises alerts if the target RPO of your VPG exceed the threshold, or if the associated journal size grows beyond the expected size. In both these scenarios, UKCloud also receives a platform monitoring alert and will investigate the cause. Additionally, the portal provides an activity log of the actions against a particular VM and a list of any errors captured on the platform. Failover The Zerto Self-Service Portal enables you to failover to your recovery site. When this is initiated, Disaster Recovery as a Service fails over the VMs inside a VPG, restoring the data and state of the VMs to the desired point from the journal. Disaster Recovery as a Service can also replicate any internal networking rules. You need to: Manually configure external networking configurations, including configuring VPNs and making any external firewall or DNS changes Check for application consistency Licensing UKCloud provides licensing for VMs protected by Zerto that utilise UKCloud as their recovery site. At present, you cannot bring your own licensing. Feedback If you find an issue with this article, click Improve this Doc to suggest a change.

    "keywords": "PSN flattening Overview The Public Services Network (PSN) has been flattened to converge PSN Assured and PSN Protected into a single network. Traffic can now flow between VMs in our Assured and Elevated security domains over the flattened PSN network. The flattened PSN network enables better collaboration between local government, blue light services and central government departments, allowing for more joined-up services, including counter-terrorism initiatives and centralised intelligence, to improve the lives of UK citizens. The information in this article is also available in our PSN flattening - an update blog post. PSN and CDSZ Although it may now be possible to bypass the Cross Domain Security Zone (CDSZ) to communicate between Elevated and Assured environments using the flattened PSN, you should consider the following: The connection isn't a short hop in the way that you would create a connection between two environments in the same security domain, where communication uses private links to remain within the UKCloud boundary, even over an external network. Instead, traffic needs to leave UKCloud, go through the service provider gateways and then come back into UKCloud. This introduces multiple hops and increases latency. You also need to consider the security implications of traffic leaving the assured environment of the UKCloud platform. You can only use the PSN for specific functions, as approved by the PSN Authority by way of the different PSN Codes of Connection. If you want to use the PSN to communicate between Elevated and Assured, you would need to fully document the use case and request approval by the PSN Authority before you could implement it. You must have a PSN connection in your Elevated environment. Restricting access to PSN Protected services It is possible to make your PSN Protected addresses unreachable to PSN Assured, if required. To do this, send a request via the PSN team contact centre . If your request is successful, the PSN team will notify all PSN Protected providers. In the event of your PSN Protected addresses being on the same subnet as another customer, the PSN team will decide what needs to be done to meet your request.

    "keywords": "Understanding PSN core services Overview This document outlines the responsibilities between you and UKCloud with regards to Public Services Network (PSN) core services, such as DNS and email filtering. The intended audience is organisations who are either consuming or presenting a service over the PSN --- both PSN Assured and PSN Protected. To be connected to the PSN, you must have a PSN compliance certificate. For more information, see https://www.gov.uk/guidance/public-services-network-psn-compliance . In this article, we use PSN to represent both PSN Protected and PSN Assured unless otherwise specified. PSN core services While you can procure PSN connectivity from multiple service providers, PSN core services are provided by Vodafone only. Traditionally, this was through the GSI Convergence Framework (GCF), whereby all core services were bundled into a single contract, regardless of whether you used them all. Core services include: DNS Network Time Protocol (NTP) Email filtering and relay Gateways to other networks, both government and public UKCloud has procured PSN connectivity on your behalf, giving you access to the PSN through a shared bandwidth model. We'll supply you with PSN IP addresses, enabling you to present and consume services over the PSN. PSN connectivity does not grant you access to PSN core services. Access to these must be purchased as a separate contract with Vodafone, and is available through Government Digital Marketplace (G-Cloud) or via Direct Award through the Network Services Framework with Vodafone. If you are a commercial organisation then you can take a contract out directly with Vodafone for core services. Making changes to PSN core services When you have a contract with Vodafone for PSN core services, you can add and change these to suit your service. To add or change the core services, complete the appropriate forms and send them to Vodafone for approval to raise a change. Depending on the contract you have with Vodafone, you will need to raise these changes differently. GCF contract customers If you have a GCF contract still in place with Vodafone, complete and submit the GCF change form: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gcf-customer-change-form G-Cloud, direct award or commercial contract customers If you have contracted through G-Cloud, have been directly awarded a contract or have a commercial contract with Vodafone, complete and submit the PSN change forms: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/psn-dns-change-forms Responsibilities When completing the change forms, it's important that you complete the correct forms and that they are submitted by the correct people. As per GDS guidance, requests for new PSN domain names must be accompanied by the PSN domain name authorisation form. This needs to be completed by the domain contract owner. All requests for changes to the core services must come from the core service contract owner. If anyone else requests changes then they will be referred to the contract owner, which could cause a delay. Customer responsibility When you're given PSN connectivity by UKCloud, we'll provide you with all the IP information you require to submit a PSN core service change request to Vodafone. You are responsible for the creation of domain names and additional information that may need to be submitted in the change form. You are responsible for completing and submitting the PSN core service change forms. UKCloud's responsibility UKCloud has no responsibility for facilitating a contract between Vodafone and our customers or partners for PSN core services. You must approach and contract with Vodafone directly. UKCloud has no responsibility for completing or submitting any change forms for changes to PSN core services on behalf of customers or partners. We may help you complete the form but you are ultimately responsible for validating and submitting the forms. UKCloud does not accept responsibility for incorrect information supplied within the change forms. Complex responsibility In certain circumstances, there may be complex aspects to responsibility: Scenario 1 - If a non-government organisation has not got a direct contract with Vodafone, but is contracted through a managed service provider, then responsibilities may be shared between the organisation and MSP. Both parties may need to complete the form, however as per GDS guidance, it is ultimately the domain contract owner who owns the validation and submission of the forms. The domain contract should sit with the non-government organisation and not the managed service provider. Scenario 2 - If a non-government organisation is currently hosted on a different hosting provider, and is thinking about moving to UKCloud, then they need to consider their current contracting relationship for core services with Vodafone. If the non-government organisation has no direct contract with Vodafone but is contracted through the hosting provider, then when they move to UKCloud they may need to take out a new contract directly with Vodafone for PSN core services. Another consideration is the domain contract ownership. As only the domain contract owner can validate and submit change requests, it's important to ensure that the domain is owned by the non-government organisation, and not the hosting provider. If the hosting provider is the current domain contract owner, then the non-government organisation should work with the hosting provider to change the ownership before moving services to UKCloud. New PSN DNS A new PSN DNS is being developed that will be free at the point of use for PSN users, relieving them of the responsibility to contract with Vodafone for DNS services. This is currently not fully operational so should not yet be relied upon, however it may be worth signing up to have early access to it upon availability.

    "keywords": "HybridConnect vs CrownConnect (Private Connectivity) Overview This article outlines the difference between HybridConnect and CrownConnect and explains when each should be used. What is HybridConnect? HybridConnect enables you to bring private connectivity into service provider locations within UKCloud's core network locations in ARK data centres. UKCloud will then arrange onward connectivity from the termination point into your cloud service. The service provider locations must be within UKCloud's core network locations for HybridConnect to be used. The current core network locations are: Farnborough A9 and Corsham SQ17. Known Service Providers with presence* within A9 and SQ17: BT Vodafone CenturyLink Virgin Media Interoute GTT * This does not necessarily mean your private connection will be terminated within these locations. You should check the planned termination location with your provider. UKCloud is not responsible for procuring the private connection or arranging any service provider activity on your behalf. You may want to implement encryption on your private connection. You can use Cloud Enablement to host physical devices for termination of this encryption if required. What is CrownConnect? CrownConnect has two flavours: Private Connectivity and Private Infrastructure. This article focuses on Private Connectivity. CrownConnect (Private Connectivity) enables you to bring private connectivity into service provider locations anywhere in the ARK data centre campus. UKCloud will then arrange for onward connectivity from the termination point into the your cloud service. The service provider locations can be anywhere within the ARK Crown Campus and are not limited to UKCloud's core network locations. UKCloud is not responsible for procuring the private connection or arranging any service provider activity on your behalf. You may want to implement encryption on your private connection. You can use Cloud Enablement to host physical devices for termination of this encryption if required. Pricing There are different pricing models for both products. These charges are applied per installation. HybridConnect CrownConnect (Private Connectivity) One-off charge £2000 £1000 Monthly charge £0 £200 (1Gb port) £500 (10Gb port) Lead times Lead times vary depending on product. HybridConnect can normally be delivered within a couple of weeks due to the locality of the termination points to UKCloud's core network, however CrownConnect is dependent on fibre installation from the termination point into UKCloud's core network location. The lead time of delivery of this fibre depends on the distance from the termination point to the core network location, but typically customers should expect 3 to 4 weeks from order to delivery.

    "keywords": "How to view storage profile usage Overview Before allocating more disk space in your UKCloud for VMware account, it is useful to check how much of your allocated space has been used. Viewing your storage usage (vCloud Director 8.20) In vCloud Director, select the Administration tab. Right-click your virtual data centre and select Open . Select the Storage Policies tab. The Requested/Limit column shows how much storage has been used as well as your storage limit. Viewing your storage usage (vCloud Director 9.1) In the vCloud Director Virtual Datacenters dashboard, go to the card for your data centre. The Storage section shows how much storage you're currently using as well as the amount of allocated storage. Viewing your storage usage (vCloud API) To check your storage profile usage programmatically, you need to call the appropriate vCloud REST API endpoint. Note Before calling this endpoint, you must first authenticate your session as described in How to access vCloud Director through the vCloud API . We've provided some sample code to show how to make this call on our GitHub repository . The using_curl.md page provides an example of how to use CURL to call the REST API. The example assumes that you have set up the following three environment variables to hold your user credentials: VCD_ORG VCD_USERNAME VCD_PASSWORD The example makes two calls to the API. The first call authenticates the session: curl -u %VCD_USERNAME%@%VCD_ORG%:%VCD_PASSWORD% -H \"Accept: application/*+xml;version=5.6\" -X POST -i https://api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/sessions Tip On Linux, use $VCD_USERNAME instead of %VCD_USERNAME% . Having authenticated successfully and received an x-vcloud-authorisation header in the response, the second call passes the authentication token as a header on the request: curl -H \"x-vcloud-authorization: a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6\" -H \"Accept: application/*+xml;version=5.6\" -i https://api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/query?type=orgVdcStorageProfile This call returns an XML structure, in which you can see an OrgVdcStorageProfileRecord element containing the following properties: storageLimitMB=\"512000\" storageUsedMB=\"65536\" The GitHub repository also provides a ruby example. Again, the script assumes the above environment variables have been set up with your user credentials. You can use the ruby script by running: ruby storage_profile.rb The output will look similar to the following: Name Used GB Total GB Percent VDC BASIC-Any 192 500 38.5% XXXX Feedback If you find an issue with this article, click Improve this Doc to suggest a change.

Adding users To add users to the SRA service offered by UKCloud, you'll need to raise a Service Request within the UKCloud Portal. This Service Request should include Certificate Requests generated by the clients you wish to add to the service. UKCloud will then send Certificates back via an email or via the Service Request. These certificates should then be copied into the devices' certificate stores. You'll also need to install the Cisco AnyConnect Client application and connection policy to each of the devices. You can find more information about this in the Getting Started Guide for Secure Remote Access . Removing users To remove a device from the SRA service offered by UKCloud, you'll need to raise a Service Request within the UKCloud Portal. This service request should contain the certificate ID for the device that needs to be revoked and can be found in the subject line of the certificate. We'll then revoke the certificate to prevent any further access. You can also delete the certificate and private key from the device you wish to stop access from. Important As part of the assurance wrap process, you'll be required to show that the devices used for remote access can be managed remotely, including revoking access in an emergency situation by disabling the device or the user account. You should not rely on UKCloud's support team as the only route for removing the ability to remotely access your environment.

    "title": "Getting Started Guide for Secure Remote Access | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for Secure Remote Access Overview Intended audience This document is for customers who have: Completed the UKCloud Assurance Wrap Been approved to use the Secure Remote Access (SRA) service to manage services in the Elevated OFFICIAL security domain on the UKCloud platform Post approval Once the SRA Assurance Wrap has been approved, we'll raise a service request for the implementation of the SRA virtual data centre (vDC) and, if needed, an Elevated (formerly IL3) vDC. (If a service request for this vDC implementation already exists, a new one won't be raised.) You can track the progress of the service request using the UKCloud Portal. During creation of the UKCloud SRA vDC, we'll ask you for some additional information via the service request: Confirm the customer account number in Elevated as a new Org will be created under the account to contain the SRA vDC. The Org number will be used as an identifier when signing certificates. The preferred IP pool you want to use for your client devices. If the IP Pool you'd prefer is in use by another customer then another will have to be chosen. We'll inform you if this is the case. If you want to specify an IP from the IP pool for each device, we'll need you to supply the mapping. Any specified DNS servers. The Elevated Network Firewall Tenant (NFT) number and the Elevated organisation containing it for connection into Elevated. A certificate signing request for each remote access device. Certificate signing request generation To enable SRA access, we'll need the certificate-signing request (CSR) from each remote access device you'll be using. The certificate-generation process will vary depending on the OS of the client device. Windows Follow the steps below to generate the CSR for a Windows device. Open the Certificates MMC snap-in (click Start , click Run , type mmc and then press Enter ) select Certificates and then Computer Account . In the console tree, double-click Personal and then click Certificates . On the Actions menu, point to All Tasks , point to Advanced Options and then click Create Custom Request to start the Certificate Enrolment wizard. Click Next . On the Custom request page, in the Templates list, we recommend using the Custom Request option as your domain policy may be incompatible with the SRA service. Select Proceed without enrolment policy and click Next . Select (No template) CNG key and ensure the PKCS#10 radio button is selected, then click Next . At the Certificate Information page, click the down arrow next to Details then click the Properties button. Click the Private Key tab, then the down arrow to the right of Key options . Change the Key size to 2048 and click Apply . Optional: If you want to back up the certificate (to protect against client device failure) click the check boxes for the private key . You'll be asked for a password. For the file format, select Base 64 and then save the CSR. Linux For Linux, an equivalent OpenSSL command would be the following: openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout myserver.key -out server.csr Ensure that the key file is preserved for the later installation steps below, as withouth this the AnyConnect client will not be able to connect the SRA service. CSR submission to UKCloud We request that you paste the contents of the CSR file directly into a ticket for us to generate the associated certificate(s), but you can also email it to us if you cannot access the Portal. VPN Cisco AnyConnect client setup To access your SRA VDC you need to download the Cisco AnyConnect client and install it on your remote access devices (requires UKCloud Portal login). For each OS there is the main Cisco AnyConnect client software install and an additional executable to enable the FIPS capability. You need to run both. Download link https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/support/knowledge_centre/a0e452d8-cd7b-49a4-a3ca-f791620cb084 Linux Install the AnyConnect client tar zxvf anyconnect-linux-64-<version number>-k9.tar.gz cd anyconnect-<version number>-/vpn sudo ./vpn_install.sh Enable FIPS tar zxvf anyconnect-linux-64-<version number>-enableFIPS.tar.gz ./ anyconnect-linux-64-<version number>-enableFIPS Windows Install the AnyConnect client The windows installation has the option of .msi or .iso (that contains the .msi ) for the AnyConnect client image. The following installs may need to be run as administrator depending on the local policy of your Windows device. Right click on the anyconnect-win-<version number>-pre-deploy.msi and select Install. Enable FIPS Double click anyconnect-EnableFIPS-win-<version number>.exe and then enter y when asked at the command prompt. Mac No further instructions required. AnyConnect client software We'll make the latest Cisco AnyConnect client software available via the Knowledge Centre using the link above. Using the latest version of the AnyConnect client will probably be a requirement of your ITSHC or service assurance wrap so it will be worth checking the above articles periodically. If a client is upgraded from a previous install then the following post installation steps will need to be performed again to ensure the client configuration isn't reverted to the default. Post-installation configuration Once you've installed the AnyConnect software and certificates on your device, you need to install the connection profile which is available in the Knowledge Centre ( https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/support/knowledge_centre/25a7111c-139e-4fd2-a52c-3412689bf1d3 ). Unzip the file and copy the xml to the following location: OS type CPA XML location Linux/Mac /opt/cisco/anyconnect/profile Windows C:\\ProgramData\\Cisco\\Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client\\Profile For Linux only In addition to the AnyConnect profile, you also need to install a local policy which is available in the Knowledge Centre: https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/support/knowledge_centre/2effd0b2-1eda-4999-87a6-6140e5fc07ea Unzip the file and copy it to: /opt/cisco/anyconnect/AnyConnectLocalPolicy.xml . Once you've copied the connection profile and local policy to the correct locations, you need to restart the AnyConnect service (using the command service vpnagentd restart ) or reboot the VM. SRA certificates Once the SRA vDC has been set up (and Elevated vDC, if needed), we'll send you an email containing the certificates we've generated (based on the CSR sent to us as above) which you need to install onto your remote access devices. For each customer SRA service a unique IssuingCA certificate is generated and used to sign each individual device certificates. The IssuingCA certificate along with the specific certificate for the device will be emailed. Both the certificates need to be installed. The certificates sent through will named as below: IssuingCA – clientcert.pem Device Certificate - E51FFC7D50C<HEX VALUE>.pem Windows certificate store Follow the steps below to import the certificates into the Windows certificate store. This assumes that you have the certificates we sent accessible to the MMC: Open the Certificates MMC snap-in (click Start , click Run , type mmc , and then press Enter ) select Certificates and then Computer Account . In the console tree, open Trusted Root Certification Authorities , right click Certificates and select All tasks – Import - Next . Click Browse , change the filter from **X.509 Certificate ( .cer, .crt) to All files . Find the IssuingCA sent to you, double click clientcert.pem and click Next . Ensure that the Place all certificates radio button has Trusted Root Certification Authorities selected then click Next then Finish . In the console tree, open Personal , right click Certificates and select All tasks – Import - Next . Click Browse , change the filter from **X.509 Certificate ( .cer, .crt) to All files . Find the device certificate sent to you, double click E51FFC7D50C .pem and click Next . Ensure that the Place all certificates radio button has Personal selected then click Next then Finish . Using the example customer SRAS-1-1-2 you should now see the client certificate in the Personal store. Double click it and as in the examples pictures below: In the General tab it should say \"You have a private key that corresponds to this certificate\". The UID should be displayed the Details tab in the Subject line in the format SRAS-1-1-2- The certification path listed in the Certification Path tab as highlighted in the example below should show the IssuingCA Linux certificate store The Linux certificate store is just a file structure under the root or user account depending on how you use Linux OS. For the Linux client to work the following must be true: All certificate files must end with the extension .pem All private key files must end with the extension .key A client certificate and its corresponding private key must have the same filename. For example client.pem and client.key Using the example customer issued certificate SRAS1-1-2-001.pem the files would be stored in the following locations for root. The key file generated above needs to moved and renamed appropriately. PEM file certificate store folders Type of certificates stored ~/.cisco/certificates/client/private/SRAS1-1-2-001.key Private keys ~/.cisco/certificates/client/SRAS1-1-2-001.pem Client certificates ~/.cisco/certificates/ca/clientcert.pem Trusted CA and root certificates Connecting to SRA Once connected to your SRA VPN, you can access your SRA walled garden via IP address or DNS name (if you have a DNS set up). Client connection methods are listed below. Linux Once you've restarted AnyConnect and installed the certificates, you can use the client with the following command line: /opt/cisco/anyconnect/bin/vpn connect sra01.ukcloud.com Or if you use a Linux desktop the client software should be available as an icon. Windows When you open the AnyConnect client you'll see a small window appear and the location of the SRA service should be populated: Click the Connect button and after a couple of status checks the client should scan the certificate store and offer the relevant certificate to initiate access. Select the certificate and click OK . Accessing the UKCloud Portal using SRA There is no direct access to the Elevated portal once the AnyConnect client connects. In most instances we'll create a virtual machine (VM) within the SRA VDC that you can VPN into in order to log in to the Elevated portal to provision and manage your SRA and Elevated VDC. Once this VM is deployed, it becomes your responsibility to manage and maintain it. This VM will be billed according to standard UKCloud billing process. Addresses to hit the Elevated portal and vCloud Director API can be obtained by raising a support ticket through the UKCloud Portal.

    "keywords": "Secure Remote Access FAQs Service What is the service? The UKCloud Secure Remote Access (SRA) service: Is based on NCSC-approved CPA technology, including Cisco AnyConnect and Cisco VPN devices Provides secure two-factor authentication based on UKCloud-assured device certificates Has a walled garden architecture that enables you to deploy and manage appropriate systems in a DMZ, allowing secure, controlled onward access to workloads hosted on the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL security domain Is integrated with the UKCloud Protective Monitoring solution (aligned with GPG13) System administrators and mobile workers can securely access workloads running on Elevated OFFICIAL from locations that don't have alternative secure network connections such as PSN or HSCN. Do I have to buy other UKCloud services to use UKCloud SRA? Yes. UKCloud SRA is available only to customers purchasing other UKCloud services such as UKCloud for VMware, Cloud Storage or UKCloud for OpenShift. Is a free trial available for the service? The assurance requirements related to this service mean that we're unable to provide a trial for this service. Does UKCloud provide the managed devices for using the SRA service? No. We don't provide them, but we have partners who can provide the managed devices and other services if required. What is the process for applying for an SRA solution? You can find the information you need in the UKCloud Portal Knowledge Centre. If you're new to UKCloud, you should contact the UKCloud sales team to discuss your requirements. What information must the application form include? As a minimum the application form must include: A business case explaining why you require an SRA solution The technical architecture of the solution incorporating the UKCloud SRA An assurance plan - your proposed approach to ensuring that risks are correctly identified, appropriate mitigation is implemented and residual risks are accepted so that both the customer and UKCloud SIROs can make an informed decision about the risks of the solution What is likely to be included in the assurance plan? The assurance plan includes: Validation of requirements by the customer (department SIRO) Evidence from the customer that end-user devices are configured and managed in line with minimum requirements (for example scope of PSN compliance with IA requirements) Evidence from the customer that users of the SRA service are vetted and security-cleared in line with minimum requirements (scope of PSN compliance with IA requirements) Confirmation by the customer that an appropriate security incident management process applies to the solution Confirmation by the customer that the service will be accessed from the UK only Confirmation by the customer and each individual user of agreement to the UKCloud Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) Identification of data flows between the walled garden and the customer's solution (firewall access control list) What requirements are placed on the access devices? The service is compatible with customer-managed end-user devices that meet the following conditions: Mandatory use of Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client or an embedded IPsec client that is assured under the NCSC CPA scheme (or equivalent standard) against the IPsec VPN for remote working software client security characteristics Mandatory user-to-device authentication ensuring only authorised users can access the end-user devices Mandatory user-to-service authentication ensuring only authorised users can access the SRA service Mandatory device-to-service authentication ensuring only authorised end-user devices can access the SRA service Mandatory use of a platform that supports platform integrity and application sandboxing to reduce the risk of the end-user device being compromised Mandatory use of application whitelisting to reduce the risk of malicious code execution on the end-user device Mandatory use of regularly updated anti-malware software to reduce the risk of malicious code execution on the end-user device Mandatory use of enterprise-enforced security policies ensuring that end-users cannot override or reconfigure security-critical features Mandatory use of external interface protection such as host-based firewalls to limit exposure of the end-user device to untrusted networks Mandatory use of a device update policy to keep the end-user device regularly updated with security patches Mandatory implementation of an incident response plan by the customer organisation to respond to security incidents such as loss of the end-user device Configuration and management of end-user devices must be assured by the consuming organisation as being in line with NCSC end-user device guidance and compliant with PSN IA conditions Recommended use of a CPA-approved (or equivalent standard) data-at-rest encryption solution Recommended use of Secure Boot where available Recommended use of an enterprise audit and monitoring service by the customer organisation to ensure security events are centrally logged and reviewed How long will the assurance process take? Each business case and proposed solution will be assessed by the UKCloud team, and must be approved by the UKCloud SIRO. We aim to carry out the assessment within five days of receiving the business case and proposed solution, but we can't commit to timelines for approval. What is the assurance wrap review? If you need help gathering appropriate evidence, or effectively designing your SRA solution, we offer an assurance wrap review to guide you towards an effective design that will help to maximise your chances of meeting compliance requirements. The variable nature of the engagement means we charge for the assurance wrap on an SFIA rate card basis, depending on the number of days' support needed. What is the assurance process for approving an SRA solution? Broadly, the assurance process is as follows: Initial application UKCloud design review (with a cloud architect) Proposed evidence pack submission (by the customer) Full evidence pack submission (by the customer) UKCloud SIRO review and approval or rejection Full details of each stage are available in the Knowledge Centre or from your account director. Does the UKCloud assurance process replace the assurance requirements of any networks a solution may be connected to? No. The UKCloud SRA service is designed to facilitate connectivity to services hosted on the UKCloud platform only. If your solution needs to face an external controlled-access network, such as PSN or HSCN, you must complete the appropriate compliance for that network. What are the ongoing requirements? When the SRA service is in operation, you are responsible for ensuring continuing compliance with Security Operating procedures (SyOps) and other security obligations. Who makes the final decision to allow or deny the use of SRA? The UKCloud SIRO is ultimately responsible for deciding which solutions and configurations are allowed. If I plan to use SRA and a Walled Garden, can I use a single Walled Garden for both? It's best to use two separate Walled Gardens within the Cross Domain Secure Zone, to ensure compliance requirements are met. You can design a solution to use a single Walled Garden infrastructure, but you're likely to require a more intensive review during the assurance wrap process. You'll still be billed for both services. Can I connect to multiple virtual data centres (VDCs) from a single Walled Garden? Yes. You only need to implement a single instance of SRA, as a bastion host can provide gateway services to more than one VDC. The assurance wrap process will outline the scope of connected services. If you want to add additional services to your SRA service, you'll need to review your existing compliance documentation via the assurance wrap. Can I use the UKCloud's SRA solution from outside the UK? No. The nature of the UKCloud solution is that you must be using it from known endpoints inside the UK. If you have international access requirements, please contact your account manager to discuss alternative options. Certificates How long do SRA certificates last for? SRA certificates last for 12 months. You'll need to renew certificates no later than two weeks before the certificates expire to avoid any interruption to your service. How do I order additional SRA certificates? To add additional certificates, raise a service request via the UKCloud Portal , selecting the \"Request Additional SRA Certificate(s)\" option. How do I renew or revoke an old certificate? To renew or revoke your certificate, raise a service request via the UKCloud Portal , selecting the \"Renew and/or Revoke SRA Certificate\" option. For renewals, it's important you give us at least two weeks' notice to prevent a break in your service. Can I renew or revoke my certificates in bulk? Yes. To renew or revoke your certificates in bulk, raise a service request via the UKCloud Portal , selecting the \"Renew and/or Revoke multiple SRA Certificates\" option. Attach the Secure Remote Access bulk renewal/revoke form containing all the certificates you need renewing and/or revoking with details including User ID (UID) and certificate name. It would also be useful to provide host name or machine name. For renewals, it's important you give us at least two weeks' notice to prevent a break in your service. What are my responsibilities for this service? You need to maintain a list of your certificates and advise us if you need to request new or additional certificates as well as needing any to be revoked. Billing and legal How will I be billed? SRA has a minimum commitment period of three months and is billed monthly. The billing model has two parts: A per-user fee, bought in packs to cover your user base An hourly rental fee for each bastion host required to support your access requirements A small bastion host is provided free of charge each month per customer. If you decide to increase the size of this VM or provision additional VMs, you'll still receive the value of the first small VM free of charge per month and this will be deducted from the invoice if larger or additional VMs are used as bastion hosts. Is there a minimum term? The service is subject to a minimum term of three months. Termination within this initial term will incur an early exit charge. What does the cost of SRA include? SRA prices include: Access to managed NCSC-approved VPN gateways A Cisco AnyConnect licence for the end-user device Two-factor authentication using device certificates A walled garden virtual data centre, where you can deploy your application services A small VM to use as a bastion host (additional costs apply for larger or additional VMs) Security Why does use of CPA-approved solutions to access the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL environment via the internet require approval by the UKCloud SIRO? UKCloud offers two ways to connect to the UKCloud platform's Elevated OFFICIAL security domain via a CPA-approved (or equivalent standard) solution: By using the UKCloud-managed SRA service (covered in this FAQ) By hosting self-managed CPA-approved (or equivalent standard) VPN solutions (see below) CPA-approved (or equivalent standard) VPN solutions have undergone a less rigorous NCSC assurance process than CAPS-approved solutions. NCSC recognises that there is therefore greater risk associated with the robustness of these solutions. As some PSN-accredited solutions (such as the UKCloud solution) host multiple customers, UKCloud has a responsibility to ensure that these less assured solutions are used appropriately. Therefore, you must have a compelling business case to justify why the use of CPA-approved (or equivalent standard) solutions is necessary. This business case is reviewed by the UKCloud SIRO (and periodically inspected by the PSN Accreditor) who will approve its use if appropriate. For clarity, CPA-approved (or equivalent standard) VPN solutions may always be used to provide an encryption overlay on a CAS(T) compliant circuit. It's only the use of these solutions over non-CAS(T)-compliant circuits (for example, the internet) that require approval by the UKCloud SIRO. Can I use UKCloud SRA to connect to the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL security domain? Yes, subject to compliance with information assurance requirements. Our SRA service is designed to enable you to connect via the internet to your services hosted on the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL security domain, by using a CPA-approved VPN solution and other NCSC guidance such as Walled Gardens. All traffic between the end-user device and the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL security domain must be routed through a Walled Garden hosted within the UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone. UKCloud is required to validate your ability to comply with information assurance requirements, which is why use of this service is subject to approval by the UKCloud SIRO. Refer to the UKCloud SRA service description on the Digital Marketplace for more information. Can I use UKCloud SRA to connect to other PSN services? No. The UKCloud SRA service is designed to facilitate connectivity to services hosted on the UKCloud platform only. Consider PSN-compliant remote access services if you require access to the broader PSN. Feedback If you find an issue with this article, click Improve this Doc to suggest a change.

    "title": "Partitioning projects or end customers using UKCloud accounts | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Partitioning projects or end customers using UKCloud accounts Overview When you request your first service on UKCloud, you're given a single account. An account can represent an organisation, a customer contract or a specific project and contains one or more UKCloud services, such as UKCloud for VMware, Cloud Storage or UKCloud for OpenStack. Within an account, Portal administrators can set permissions for users so that they can access only those services and features that they are allowed to view and use. This is a simple way to manage smaller accounts, however the more projects or end customers you have, the more complicated and confusing the account can become without some degree of separation. Multiple accounts are very useful when managing separate customer workloads, for example billing and organisation. They can help when different teams are working on separate projects within the same business by separating the projects into different accounts enabling easier identification and management of projects and personnel. This gives the correct level of access to each team to ensure their view of the environments is specific to their work. If you decide that you would like to bring additional workloads to UKCloud, you should consider whether to stay with a single account or choose to have multiple accounts. UKCloud account options There are two options that you can choose from to manage your projects and end customers. The table below discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each option: Option 1: Multiple accounts Option 2: Single account Use cases Managed service provider with different end customers Organisation with more than one project Single customer, or partner with single customer Organisation with more than one project Advantages Enables administrators to set permissions for each account user so that they can access only the services that they are authorised to view and use. Enables easy identification of which services and users are associated with each account. Provides easy access to all your projects in one place. Facilitates greater visibility of users within each account and better security with multiple end customers by reducing the risk of human error, ensuring that each user has the correct permissions associated with their UKCloud services within the accounts. Enables easy tracking of billing for all your services in one place without the need to switch between accounts. Provides the ability to tighten and loosen security requirements based on the specifics of that workload. Reduces the risk of human error, for example, raising a ticket in the wrong account. Provides the ability to increase or decrease security requirements on an account by account basis. For example, with our Two Factor Authentication, Portal administrators can set the optional extra security for some or all accounts. Makes it easier to view individual account tickets without the need of a filter. Disadvantages Necessitates switching view in the Portal to see the services and tickets within each account. Shows all tickets in a single list, making it more difficult to locate tickets for a particular project. Similarly with users for different workloads. Introduces risk of human error, for example, raising a ticket in the wrong account. Limits granularity of authentication; cannot set individual authentication methods for different workloads. Creating multiple accounts When you bring a new workload to UKCloud, your Technical Account Manager (TAM) or Customer Success Manager (CSM) will discuss your requirements and whether you want to create an additional account. If you decide that an additional account is best for your setup, UKCloud will create it for you. Once the additional account is created, the Portal administrator for the account can then add existing UKCloud Portal users to the account by raising a Service Request via MyCalls or add new users to the UKCloud Portal onto the new account, which the administrator can add themselves.

    "title": "UKCloud response to Spectre and Meltdown | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "UKCloud response to Spectre and Meltdown Introduction This article explains the implications of Spectre and Meltdown for the UKCloud platform and describes what steps UKCloud are taking to mitigate against these vulnerabilities. What are Spectre and Meltdown? Meltdown and Spectre are attack methods that exploit speculative execution techniques, intended to improve performance, used by Intel CPUs. Meltdown and Spectre use the fact that speculative execution allows unsecured access to kernel memory to attempt to obtain protected information. For more detailed information, see: Spectre variant 1: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5753 Spectre variant 2: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5715 Meltdown: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5754 How does this affect the UKCloud platform? The main fear for cloud customers in multi-tenant environments is that processor-level vulnerabilities are shared with neighbouring customers on the same server. One advantage that UKCloud has as a specialist serving only UK Public Sector and healthcare organisations is that all clients are known to be upstanding organisations serving taxpayers and patients in the UK. This is like a gated community of neighbours that have all been vetted. Underlying platform Like most organisations, UKCloud's underlying infrastructure is susceptible to all three of these recently identified vulnerabilities. We're working with our infrastructure partners to ensure that we take the appropriate corrective actions to ensure that the vulnerabilities are mitigated. We've identified which parts of our infrastructure are at greatest risk of exploitation and will prioritise patches to those parts first, working backwards from the highest to lowest risk. Customer applications While UKCloud works to patch the underlying infrastructure, you should also be working to ensure that you're patching your virtual machines. You should also be aware that patches for all three vulnerabilities exist and UKCloud customers can self-serve these by downloading them from our on-platform patch repositories. We expect additional patches to land in the coming weeks and months, which we'll make available in our repository, so be on the lookout for updates from your vendors. Platform benchmarks There is a minor performance overhead caused by the patches supplied by hardware and software vendors used to address Meltdown and Spectre. All modern IT systems, including those platforms operated by cloud providers, are in the same situation --- needing to apply patches, and initial indications are that systems are having to accept the resultant performance hit. Recent benchmark reports show that the performance of our platform is market-leading; we don't expect this lead to be impacted by the changes required to mitigate Spectre and Meltdown. UKCloud for VMware As and when we receive, test and apply patches from VMware, we'll perform benchmark tests to assess the performance impact on the service. We'll update this article when the results of these tests are available. UKCloud for OpenStack UKCloud takes the performance of its UKCloud for OpenStack platform seriously, and has been benchmarking the possible effects of the Spectre and Meltdown patches. To perform these tests, we use Google's Perf Kit ( https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/PerfKitBenchmarker ) to run a set of repeatable benchmarks ( https://github.com/UKCloud/perfkit ). The benchmarks were run against our pre-production environment, with a zero workload. First, we ran the benchmarks with no patches applied and ran the tests for two days on a repeating cycle. We then applied the required patches to both the underlying infrastructure and the guest OS, and then reran the same tests. We ran the following workloads: storage_benchmarks: aerospike mongodb_ycsb sysbench_oltp fio block_storage_workload: workload_mode: logging database streaming network_benchmarks: iperf: copy_throughput: copy_benchmark_mode: scp dd cp compute_benchmarks: silo: hpcc: redis: platform: cluster_boot: You can find details of each of the individual workload types and how they are performed in the perfkit link above. As expected, we've seen some degradation in performance. Our hardest hit application was Redis, which suffered the largest drop in performance. MongoDB and aerospike saw decreases, but only of single digit percentages. Storage and network throughputs were also affected. Network throughput performance decreased by around 15%, and we saw an increase in IO load while running these benchmarks. However, we saw no noticeable increase in storage volume storage latency. Workloads that only utilise the CPU saw no change. In conclusion, you should be aware that the application of the mitigations of Spectre 1 and 2 and Meltdown will have an effect on currently running workloads. Note These workload tests are auto-generated and do not conform to real-world application usage. Customers running these workloads may experience a greater or lesser impact. Ongoing activities One of the advantages of moving to the cloud is the ability to roll out upgrades and security patches quickly and with ease across an entire estate. UKCloud assesses the security of our environment on a daily basis, in line with best practice and international standards, and are committed to reacting promptly and appropriately to investigate and address any threats or vulnerabilities which have been identified. Our partners and vendors release frequent patches to address security vulnerabilities. We've already allocated specialist UKCloud resources to work with our vendors on this matter given its context within our environments. When received, these patches are assessed for relevance, installed and undergo extensive integration testing. We'll provide regular updates via the UKCloud Portal and recommend that you subscribe to notifications. For more information about how to do this, see Signing up to Portal notifications . Best practices While we'll continue to assess the security of our platform and react promptly and appropriate to address the threat posed by these vulnerabilities, there are some things you can do to protect your own environment: Upgrade your edge gateway to the latest version (currently, 6.2.7). For more information, see How to upgrade your edge gateway . Ensure that you implement robust firewall rules, which are not too open, to control what traffic can get through to your virtual machines. For more information, see How to create firewall rules . Make sure that you're implementing strong password policies to prevent unauthorised access to your VMs. Keep checking the Cyber Security News page in the UKCloud Portal for the latest details on Spectre and Meltdown and advice on proactive actions you should take to mitigate and protect your environment. For more information, see Understanding the Cyber Security News page . Download any relevant vendor patches as soon as they are available and make sure your thoroughly test them in a pre-production environment before applying to your live environment. Summary UKCloud is working with our partners and vendors to ensure that the relevant patches to mitigate against the vulnerabilities raised by Spectre and Meltdown are applied in a safe and effective manner. We'll continue to update you on our progress via Portal notifications. As we apply patches, we're performing benchmark testing to determine the effect these changes may have on the performance of our platform. We recommend that you follow best practice advice to ensure that your own environments are protected as much as possible against these current threats, as well as any other potential threats that may arise in the future. All cloud providers are facing similar challenges to address these threats and deal with the resultant performance impact.

If the availability of the service is less than the associated Availability Commitment, the customer may request Service Credits for the service within 30 calendar days of the service being deemed unavailable. Unavailability and Service Level Agreement events Subject to the Service Level Agreement (SLA) limitations detailed below, the service will be considered unavailable (and an SLA event will be deemed as having taken place) if UKCloud’s monitoring detects that the service or component has failed for five consecutive minutes. The total number of minutes that the service is unavailable is measured from the time that UKCloud confirms the SLA event has occurred until the time that UKCloud resolves the issue and the service becomes available to the customer. If two or more SLA events occur simultaneously, the SLA event with the longest duration will be used to determine the total number of minutes for which the service was unavailable. Service Credits If the availability of the service for a particular month falls below the Availability Commitment specified in the applicable SLA (subject to the SLA limitations provided below), customers will be eligible to request Service Credits. Service Credits will be calculated as a percentage of the fees billed for the monthly period during which the SLA event occurred (to be applied at the end of the billing cycle, or of the subsequent cycle if a claim is made after an invoice has been paid). You will not be eligible to receive a Service Credit if your account has any undisputed payments outstanding beyond their due date or you are in violation of UKCloud’s Terms and Conditions including the UKCloud System Interconnect Security Policy (SISP). Service Level Agreement limitations The following will be excluded from any time-based calculations related to the service being unavailable: Service dependant — planned maintenance windows (as specified in the applicable service description) Emergency maintenance (as specified in the applicable service description) Your misuse of a particular service (as defined in the UKCloud Terms and Conditions and the UKCloud System Interconnect Security Policy (SISP)) A force majeure event Denial of service attacks, virus or hacking attacks for which there is no commercially reasonable, known solution; or any other events that are not within the direct control of UKCloud or that could not have been avoided with commercially reasonable care Packet loss, network or connectivity (for example, internet, MPLS) problems beyond UKCloud’s management boundary (for example, border router) supporting our connectivity to the public internet or government secure networks Any customer-defined/customer-controlled event (for example, unavailability of service resulting from inadequate customer-subscribed services, resources or configuration) The customer will not be eligible to receive a Service Credit if the service account has any undisputed payments outstanding beyond their due date, or you are in violation of UKCloud’s Terms and Conditions including the UKCloud System Interconnect Security Policy (SISP). Service level agreement claims To request a Service Credit, the customer must file a Support Request within thirty (30) calendar days of the relevant suspected SLA event. UKCloud will review the request and issue a Service Credit if applicable. Service Credits will be issued only to the customer that UKCloud invoices for the applicable instance of the service, as a separate credit note that can be applied towards a future invoice for that service only. If the customer’s contract term for the service expires or is terminated prior to a Service Credit being issued, the Service Credit will become void as of the date of the expiration or termination. UKCloud SLA monitoring UKCloud monitors various elements across the service to ensure that availability can be measured appropriately and realistically. Some elements are generic across all services others are service specific.

    "title": "Understanding sites, regions and zones | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Understanding sites, regions and zones Introduction This guide explains how we've designed the UKCloud platform using sites, regions and zones to enable you to design a highly-available and disaster-tolerant cloud solution that meets your specific requirements for resilience. The diagram below shows the relationship between sites, regions and zones and provides a broad indication as to the purpose of each. We've engineered our cloud platform to tolerate inevitable failures at or below the infrastructure layer (for example, hardware failures and power or cooling interruptions) to ensure that the platform remains available. To ensure your applications and the services they deliver are highly available, we encourage you to design for failure and build disaster recovery capabilities into your applications. Depending on the type of failure you are trying to mitigate, our platform enables you to use sites, regions and zones to implement appropriate resilience into your solution. For specific services, such as UKCloud for OpenStack or UKCloud for VMware, we provide more detailed design guides and blueprints to explore the design choices you have with our platform. Additionally, you can always engage a Cloud Architect who can work with you to deploy the right architecture on our platform. Understanding sites What is a site? A site is a geographically specific location. UKCloud has two UK‑based sites, separated by 100 km, in Farnborough and Corsham (see diagram above). Sites provide: Independent power, security, geography and infrastructure Independent WAN connections from multiple service providers Local maintenance and platform support teams Shared UKCloud service support and management teams How do sites help me mitigate against failure? Building your solution across multiple sites provides resilience against scenarios such as natural disasters, targeted terrorist attacks or mass WAN failure. If an event affects a particular site, your system can continue running on the other site. The separation of UKCloud's two sites aligns with CESG's published guidance on architecting for disaster avoidance. What else should I consider? Although we operate secure, high‑bandwidth and low‑latency interconnects between our sites, the latency of transporting data within the same site will always be lower. If you deploy your solution across sites, you should always perform thorough testing to ensure that any increase in latency (particularly storage latency) is within tolerable levels and does not impede the performance of your solution under heavy load. Understanding regions What is a region? Within each site, our platform provides a number of independent regions (see diagram above). Each region is a physically segregated part of the platform with its own power infrastructure, management services and networking components. This enables you to design resilient solutions that are contained entirely within a single site. Each region provides a particular subset of UKCloud services, for example UKCloud for VMware, UKCloud for OpenStack or Cloud Storage, so the regions that you can use for your solution depend on where your selected (and prospective) UKCloud services are available. For example, in the diagram below you can see that UKCloud for VMware is provided in regions 2 and 5, however UKCloud for OpenStack is provided only in region 5. How do regions help me mitigate against failure? By architecting for separate regions, you can improve resilience to outages that affect: The control and management of your VMs Network connectivity to your VMs The power infrastructure within the data centre. The impact of an outage on your environment depends on the services you consume and how you have architected your environment at the region level. For example, the impact of a region‑affecting outage for UKCloud for VMware may be different than for UKCloud for OpenStack. What else should I consider? Certain product features --- such as on-platform protection technologies like snapshot protection or journaling --- may be available only in certain regions. Check UKCloud services by region for further details. In addition, some common service features --- such as VM image catalogues, access to storage pools, and so on --- may be available only to solutions running within that region, and not replicated by UKCloud across multiple regions. This may require you to duplicate some of your management tools and services. You should consider which services are available across multiple regions when designing your solutions. Understanding zones What is a zone? A zone is a distinct hardware installation within a region, utilising common networking infrastructure but having independent server and storage infrastructure. Ordinarily, each zone hosts only one UKCloud service, but each service, for example UKCloud for VMware or UKCloud for OpenStack, may be provided in multiple zones in each site (see diagram below). Each zone is part of a particular security domain: either Assured OFFICIAL or Elevated OFFICIAL (see diagram below). How do zones help me mitigate against failure? You can utilise zones to provide additional confidence in your ability to tolerate outages and mitigate against: Cluster-wide component outages caused by logical configuration errors Significant hardware failures Issues occurring within the hypervisor or virtual SAN For example, you can load-balance across two zones to ensure that your service stays online in the event of a zone outage. What else should I consider? Designing your solutions to make use of zones rather than regions and sites achieves the lowest latency, helping to reduce the risk of data inconsistency while optimising the IO performance across your solution. Depending on the services you consume, each zone may have its own management interface, so the complexity of managing your environment potentially increases with each additional zone. You should also be aware that the zones within a region operate on a shared network, therefore any issues on that network affect all the zones in the region. If you want to mitigate against potential network outages, you should consider designing your solution across multiple regions, but you should carefully assess the risk that the highly unlikely event of a loss of region or site presents and how this may influence your overall solution.

    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for Cloud GPU Visualisation Introduction Cloud GPU enables you to supplement your on-platform compute resources with GPU capabilities. This service enables you to use UKCloud's main infrastructure platforms to meet the specialist requirements of some advanced applications, with the benefits of a cloud environment. It supports the following types of workloads: Compute workloads. GPUs have become prevalent in a world that needs a lot of data processing, fast. The parallel nature of GPU cores lends itself perfectly to supporting initiatives such as deep or machine learning and large-scale mathematical modelling. Visualisation workloads. Describes the traditional use cases for GPU processing --- these include simulation, powering desktop applications with graphics content (such as computer aided design), video encoding, rendering or streaming. This Getting Started Guide provides an introduction for how to use Cloud GPU for visualisation workloads and describes the tasks you need to perform to get the service up and running. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have access to the UKCloud Portal and vCloud Director. Cloud GPU overview We offer two GPU variants for use with our cloud platform: Use case Compute Visualisation Likely card NVIDIA® Tesla® P100 NVIDIA M60 Series Card with GRID™ Overview NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU accelerators are the most advanced ever built. Designed to accelerate the compute-intensive elements of applications, they are ideal if you're looking to deliver deep learning, analytics or HPC solutions. NVIDIA GRID is designed to share virtual GPUs (vGPUs) across multiple virtual desktop and applications instances. This enables you to deliver graphically intensive applications such as design software and video streaming. Precision Double precision Single precision Delivery model vGPU vGPU With Cloud GPU Visualisation, you can: Bring any application to the cloud --- Applications that have previously struggled to transition to the cloud because of GPU requirements can now be moved, improving manageability of your data and applications, while increasing collaborative opportunities. Centralise your applications --- Cloud GPU enables you to centralise your applications to improve access to them. By doing so, users can access the tools they need from anywhere, anytime on commodity devices. Visualise data in real-time --- Improved visualisation capabilities provided by Cloud GPU Visualisation enables you to visualise data in real-time to render virtualised environments when you need them. This helps you to: Design using Computer Aided Design applications in a centralised environment, enabling ease of collaboration Create and run simulations Render and analyse high resolution images and video Before you begin When using our Cloud GPU service for visualisation workloads, you should consider the following: Before requesting your Cloud GPU Visualisation service: You must create a virtual machine (VM) for the service. You can use any template for the VM, but bear in mind that the operating system must be compatible with the vGPU profile that you select for the service (see table in Provisioning your Cloud GPU service ). Your Cloud GPU VM must be in a PRIORITY virtual data centre (VDC). Your Cloud GPU VM should be using hardware version 11 (to upgrade the hardware version, right-click the VM and select Upgrade Virtual Hardware Version ). You must power off the vApp that contains your Cloud GPU VM so that UKCloud can migrate the VM to a GPU-enabled server. Snapshot Protection is not available for your VM, so you must implement your own backup solution. Currently, there is no high availability or disaster recovery option; your VM cannot be migrated to a different host in the event of host failure.

    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for Cloud GPU Compute Introduction Cloud GPU enables you to supplement your on-platform compute resources with GPU capabilities. This service enables you to use UKCloud's main infrastructure platforms to meet the specialist requirements of some advanced applications, with the benefits of a cloud environment. It supports the following types of workloads: Compute workloads. GPUs have become prevalent in a world that needs a lot of data processing, fast. The parallel nature of GPU cores lends itself perfectly to supporting initiatives such as deep or machine learning and large-scale mathematical modelling. Visualisation workloads. Describes the traditional use cases for GPU processing --- these include simulation, powering desktop applications with graphics content (such as computer aided design), video encoding, rendering or streaming. This Getting Started Guide provides an introduction for how to use Cloud GPU for compute workloads and describes the tasks you need to perform to get the service up and running. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have access to the UKCloud Portal and vCloud Director. Cloud GPU overview We offer two GPU variants for use with our cloud platform: Use case Compute Visualisation Likely card NVIDIA® Tesla® P100 NVIDIA M60 Series Card with GRID™ Overview NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU accelerators are the most advanced ever built. Designed to accelerate the compute-intensive elements of applications, they are ideal if you're looking to deliver deep learning, analytics or HPC solutions. NVIDIA GRID is designed to share virtual GPUs (vGPUs) across multiple virtual desktop and applications instances. This enables you to deliver graphically intensive applications such as design software and video streaming. Precision Double precision Single precision Delivery model vGPU vGPU With Cloud GPU, you can: Process large data sets --- The significantly improved computational power provided by Cloud GPU means that you can gain insight into your data by using the massively parallelised capabilities to process large data sets. This enables: Parallel processing of data in a fraction of the time of using just CPU Machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence Mathematical modelling and data sequencing Healthcare modelling Predictive threat analysis Bring any application to the cloud --- Applications that have previously struggled to transition to the cloud because of GPU requirements can now be moved, improving manageability of your data and applications, while increasing collaborative opportunities. Centralise your applications --- Cloud GPU enables you to centralise your applications to improve access to them. By doing so, users can access the tools they need from anywhere, anytime on commodity devices. Visualise data in real-time --- Improved visualisation capabilities provided by Cloud GPU enables you to visualise data in real-time to render virtualised environments when you need them. This helps you to: Design using Computer Aided Design applications in a centralised environment, enabling ease of collaboration Create and run simulations Render and analyse high resolution images and video Before you begin When using our Cloud GPU service for compute workloads, you should consider the following: Your Cloud GPU virtual machine (VM) must be in a PRIORITY virtual data centre (VDC). You should create your Cloud GPU VM using the appropriate UKCloud template from the GPGPU public catalogue. Your deployed Cloud GPU VM should be using hardware version 11. The shell VM in the Cloud GPU VM template uses hardware version 11. Snapshot Protection is not available for your VM, so you must implement your own backup solution. Currently, there is no high availability or disaster recovery option; your VM cannot be migrated to a different host in the event of host failure. In the event of a host failure, you must wait for the host to be returned to service. Creating your virtual machine Before you request your Cloud GPU service, you must create a VM for the service using the UKCloud GPU-enabled template. Log in to the UKCloud Portal. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal . If necessary, switch to the appropriate account. Click My VMs . Click the compute service (vOrg) that contains the VDC in which you want to create the VM. Important You must create your VM in a PRIORITY VDC. If you don't already have a VDC for this type of workload, you can create one using the steps in the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware . On the vCloud Director tab, enter your password and click Confirm . On the vCloud Director Home tab, click Add vApp from Catalog . On the Select vApp Template page of the Add vApp from Catalog dialog box, from the Look in list, select Public Catalogs . Select All Templates .

    "keywords": "How to use UKCloud's email service with your application Overview Many customers who use UKCloud's IaaS need to be able to send email from, or receive email into, their applications. Although we don't have an SMTP relay service dedicated to this purpose, you can use our Email and Collaboration service to meet your needs. This can be particularly valuable if you're using the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL (formerly PGA IL3) platform, as it doesn't connect directly to the internet, but to secure government networks such as PSN and HSCN, where few mail relay providers are available. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process for configuring your application to use our Email & Collaboration service. UKCloud Email and Collaboration as a Service The service provides enterprise-class functionality for end-users, on a per-mailbox, per- month pricing model. It offers several options for mailbox access, including POP3, IMAP4 and SMTP --- all with TLS (SSL) encryption --- as well as HTTPS. Exchange ActiveSync is also supported. Although the service was designed with end-users in mind, there's nothing to stop you using the supported protocols to allow an application to access a mailbox in order to send or receive email. This will generally be achieved via SMTP or POP3 over TLS. It's worth noting that there's a minimum commitment of 25 mailboxes with this service --- but they don't all have to be used. Email on the Elevated OFFICIAL platform The instructions in this document are written for the UKCloud Assured OFFICIAL (formerly PGA IL2) platform, which is internet facing. If you wish to send and/or receive mail on the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL platform, the same general instructions apply, but there are a few differences to be aware of: The Elevated mail platform is PSN facing, so you'll need a PSN- or GCF- registered domain name in order to use the service The hostname for UKCloud's mail server is different, and will be provided to you once your order has been processed By default, you'll only be able to connect to UKCloud's mail server using HTTPS --- you'll need to raise a service request in the Elevated portal to request access from your virtual data centre to the UKCloud mail server via SMTP, POP3 or IMAP as required Getting started with Email and Collaboration To start creating mailboxes on the Email and Collaboration service, you first need to decide on a domain name, which must be a real-world, registered domain name. You can use a new domain name, or simply delegate a sub-domain of your organisation's existing domain name. You'll need to configure your chosen domain's MX record as mail.skyscapecs.net . Once you've decided on a domain name and submitted your order form, the UKCloud team will configure your domain name on our platform and provide you with credentials for an administrator account. You'll be able to use this account to create mailboxes on the platform. A mailbox will be needed for each email address you want to be able to send from, or receive to. Configuring a mailbox for use with an application This section takes you through the process of configuring a mailbox on UKCloud's Email and Collaboration platform for use with an application. The first step is to create a mailbox for this purpose. Once your domain name and administrator accounts have been configured, you can do this by logging on to the Administrator console at https://mail.skyscapecs.net:7071 Create a new mailbox --- configure the account name and password as you normally would, but make sure you don't choose the option to force a password change: Configure the remaining options in the New Account wizard to suit, then click Finish to complete the mailbox creation. You're now ready to configure your application to connect to the mailbox to send and/or receive mail. Sending outbound email To send outbound email, your application needs to support SMTP authentication and TLS encryption. Provided this is the case, simply configure the following settings in your application: SMTP Server/Mail relay host: mail.skyscapecs.net Port number: 465 Use TLS*: Yes Username/Password: as configured From Address: as configured Note The mail server doesn't support upgrading from an insecure connection via the STARTTLS command. Your application will need to establish a secure connection before submitting SMTP commands. Receiving inbound email To receive inbound email, your application needs to support POP3 or IMAP4 over TLS. Provided this is the case, simply configure the following settings in your application: Mailbox server: mail.skyscapecs.net Protocol: POP3S or IMAPS Port number: 993 (POP3S) or 995 (IMAPS) Username/Password: as configured Applications without TLS support Unfortunately, not all applications support sending or receiving mail over TLS. Some older applications may not support TLS at all, and some require use of the STARTTLS command for sending mail. In this situation, you could consider using a 'wrapper' application, which will create the TLS tunnel independently of your application. A good example of such an application is stunnel: https://www.stunnel.org/index.html Stunnel can secure SMTP, IMAP4, POP3 (or any other protocol) as follows: A listener is created on your local system on a designated TCP port Applications open unencrypted connections to this port When an application connects, stunnel will open a secure connection to the UKCloud mail server All commands sent by the application will be proxied directly to the UKCloud mail server over the secure connection When the application terminates the insecure connection, stunnel terminates the secure connection The diagram below shows stunnel encrypting SMTP traffic. Note An example working stunnel config is below to send smtp traffic on port 25 to zimbra on TLS port 465 [smtp] accept = 25 client = yes connect = mail.skyscapecs.net:465 ;delay = yes You can get full documentation, how to and FAQ guides from the stunnel website.

    "keywords": "Troubleshooting Disaster Recovery as a Service Overview This guide describes some of the issues you may encounter when using UKCloud's Disaster Recovery to the Cloud service: Starting a test failover takes a long time RPO alerts and bitmap syncing Recovery storage errors and journal size alerts during test failovers Test failover VMs do not perform as expected Important During the failover process, any change in the configuration or state of the live or failed‑over VMs (for example, power on or power off) will cause failure of the failover and may corrupt the VPG. This could make a full resync necessary and, in a disaster recovery situation, could prevent failover completely. Starting a test failover takes a long time Cause When you initiate a failover, Zerto creates VMs in vCloud (referred to as testing recovery VMs) and then performs further tasks to provide the correct data for those VMs to boot from. VM creation and other operations in vCloud unavoidably take some time, therefore when performing a simultaneous failover of many VMs, it can take a while before the VMs are powered on and ready for use. Zerto automatically powers on the testing recovery VMs when it has completed the operations necessary to make the correct data available to the VMs. Powering on a VM prematurely will cause it to be corrupted and will impact live replication. Additionally, manually powering-off a testing recovery VM will cause live replication to stop; testing recovery VMs must remain powered on for the duration of the test failover. Solution If you're failing over many VMs simultaneously, you should anticipate that it will take some time before the VMs are powered on and ready for use. Important Do not manually power on or power off recovery VMs during a failover. Doing so will corrupt the VPG. RPO alerts and bitmap syncing Cause Some application and database servers have a high change rate. Limited VPN bandwidth from the on-premises sites means that often changes to the live VMs occur faster than the rate of replication. Solution We recommend that, unless there are specific reasons otherwise, you set the priority of your Disaster Recovery to the Cloud VPGs to Medium to ensure the necessary VPN bandwidth. You can set the priority of VPGs for which a short RPO is essential to High, however, this will cause the other VPGs to have a higher RPO. If your environment includes virtual disks that are used purely as log or temporary file systems, you can designate these disks as Temp Disks. This will mean that the data is synced during the initial sync (to bring over the partitioning/formatting), but ongoing changes that that disk will not be replicated. This can reduce the WAN bandwidth required to keep acceptable RPOs. This will also prevent rapidly changing transaction log file systems from filling up the journal. However, you should carefully consider and test this configuration to make sure that this data is not required in a disaster recovery situation. Recovery storage errors and journal size alerts during test failovers Cause Due to the way that testing recovery VMs are instantiated, Zerto is unable to flush the oldest journal entries into the base recovery disks while a test failover is in progress. This means that the journal size continuously grows while the test failover is in progress, at a rate dependant on the change rate of the live VM. This will cause alerts when the journal reaches 75% of its maximum size. When the journal reaches 100% of its maximum size, replication of the live VM stops since there is nowhere to place new checkpoints. At this point, the VPG will show a state of Recovery Storage Error and will be required to perform a lengthy sync when the test failover is stopped. Solution If it is essential that the journal is continuous, then you should avoid long failover tests, or make arrangements for the live applications to be shut down or quiesced during the failover test. Additionally, you will see Recovery Storage Error and other transient errors in the Zerto console while a test failover is in the process of starting; you can ignore these in all cases. Test failover VMs do not perform as expected Cause Testing recovery VMs (and live failed-over VMs before they are committed) do not run from normal virtual disks. To remove the need to fully clone all data, when Zerto does a test failover (or a live failover before committing) it creates a simulated view onto the VM's disks at the checkpoint time you select. All reads from the disks are intercepted by Zerto's ESXi kernel driver and then processed with reference to the journal to ensure that the correct data for that checkpoint's point-in-time is returned. Additionally, any writes made to the testing recovery VM are diverted to a temporary file. While the test failover is in progress, Zerto is unable to flush the oldest journal checkpoints into the base VMDK disks in order to preserve the integrity of the replicated base disks and journals. Solution Zerto test failovers are intended to give confidence that the data on the VM disks is being correctly replicated. We recommend that you should not use test failover VMs for detailed application testing for the following reasons: If the test failover goes on too long, new changes from the live VM will cause the journal to fill, halting replication of the live VM A large volume of writes to the testing recovery VMs will cause those VMs to fail Storage performance of the testing recovery VMs is very poor, potentially up to 50% slower than native performance These issues are also applicable to live failovers that have not yet been committed. When the commit operation is completed, the resulting VMs are running from normal VMDK files and are no longer subject to these problems. When performing a live failover, we recommend that: You stop the applications on the on-premises site VMs before triggering the failover. This ensures that the application state is consistent at the point of failover and will avoid Recovery Storage Errors due to the journal filling while the VPG is in a live Failover Before Commit state. Do not perform any application testing on the failed-over VMs that might cause too much new data to be written to the VM's disks before commit. If possible, you should complete the commit operation before the failed-over VMs serve production workloads. Additionally, you should consider the following during a live failover: We do not recommend the use of auto commit; this option causes the commit to occur automatically after the failover is initiated. Do not enable reverse replication unless you fully understand all the potential implications of doing so. Enabling reverse replications causes the VMDK disks of the source VMs to be altered to seed the reverse replication. The VPGs in Zerto enter a Needs Configuration state after the failover is committed. We recommend that you delete the VPGs from Zerto at this stage to ensure reverse replication cannot be configured accidently. If reverse replication isn't enabled, the source VMs will remain untouched (even post-commit). It's likely that the live failover (excluding the commit operation) will take a similar length of time as a test failover. The commit operation converts the failed-over VMs into normal vCloud VMs not subject to the limitations inherent to test failover (or live failover before commit) VMs. The commit operation is performed while the VMs (on the UKCloud side) remain running and will take several hours (dependant on the size and change-rate of the live VM).

    "title": "Getting Started Guide for Disaster Recovery as a Service | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for Disaster Recovery as a Service Overview UKCloud's Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS) is a powerful, self-service replication and recovery tool that can improve organisational resilience and enable seamless migration of applications between your local VMware or Hyper-V powered data centre and UKCloud's disaster recovery enabled regions. This means that in the event of a VM being compromised, for example, a local hardware failure, power outage, security incident (such as theft) or WAN connectivity disruption, you can quickly recover your VMs to the UKCloud platform and ensure that the disruption to your service is minimised. DRaaS is powered by Zerto, a leading provider of disaster recovery software for the cloud. This guide covers the tasks you need to perform to get DRaaS up and running in your environment. Intended audience This guide is intended for any user who needs to set up DRaaS. Introduction to Disaster Recovery as a Service If you provide services from your own data centre or on-site servers, DRaaS can help you achieve a robust and flexible replication and recovery service, with the UKCloud platform as the recovery site. When you have set up DRaaS for your VMs, every write operation to the protected VMs is copied and stored in a journal on the recovery site. This means that in the event of a VM being compromised, you can quickly recover the VM to a point in time before the disaster took place. You add disaster recovery protection to your VMs by adding them to a virtual protection group (VPG). Each VM in the VPG is synchronised to the recovery site on the UKCloud platform, and a journal is created. After this initial synchronisation, each subsequent write operation to the VM is processed as normal on the original site and a copy is asynchronously sent to the UKCloud site and written to the journal. Each journal entry exists in the journal for 14 days (the journal history). When the journal history is reached, as new journal entries are created, older entries are written to the recovery VM's virtual disks. Every few seconds, a checkpoint is written to every journal for each VM in the VPG to ensure crash-consistency between the VMs. If you need to recover a VM, you select a checkpoint to recover to. For example, in the case of a security incident, you could recover to a checkpoint from before the incident. During recovery, the VMs are created in a vApp on the recovery site and the recovery disks for each VM are attached to the recovered VM. Information in the journal is then promoted to the VM to bring it up to the date and time of the selected checkpoint. Two terms you may hear in connection with disaster recovery are recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO). The RPO indicates the amount of data you can afford to lose in the event of a disaster. For example, if your application data changes fairly infrequently, your RPO can be higher as the data remains fairly static. However, if your application data is constantly changing, you'll need your RPO to be smaller to avoid significant loss of data in the event of a disaster. The RTO is the amount of time you can tolerate your application being unavailable in the event of a disaster. For example, if your application provides critical functionality, you'll need to bring it back online very quickly. However, for a less critical application, you may be able to tolerate a longer outage. Because of the use of regular checkpoints (every few seconds), our Zerto-powered DRaaS provides a minimal RPO. The ability to use recovered VMs even before all the journal data has been promoted provides a good RTO as well. Before you begin When you order DRaaS, UKCloud provides you with: The IP address (from the IP range you provided to UKCloud) of the Zerto Cloud Connector (ZCC) deployed in your recovery VDC; you'll need this to complete the setup of the site-to-site VPN between your local environment and your recovery VDC A link to the appropriate version of the Zerto Virtual Manager (ZVM) for you to deploy in your local environment A ZORG ID to identify your Zerto environment within the UKCloud platform Access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal (ZSSP) in the appropriate UKCloud zone, where you can trigger a failover You should consider the following: VMs must be powered on to be synchronised. The operating system used by the protected VMs must also be supported in the recovery site. Disaster Recovery as a Service captures every action. When a VM is deleted, the associated journal is also deleted. We provide a single default service profile. The details of this are available in the DRaaS Service Scope. We do not currently provide the option for you to create custom profiles. System requirements To use DRaaS, you must have a valid, centrally managed vSphere or HyperV estate. A single hypervisor is not sufficient. The following table lists the minimum requirements for DRaaS, based on the currently deployed version of Zerto Virtual Replication (4.5U4) on the UKCloud platform: Product Supported Version Management Plane VMWare vCenter 4.0U1 -- 6.0U2 Microsoft SCVMM 2012 R2 and Server Core: Update Rollup 6-11 (recommended) 2012 R2 and Server Core: RTM Hosts VMWare ESX/ESXi 4.0U1-4.0U3, 4.0U4 , 4.1-6.0U1, 6.0U2 Microsoft Hyper-V 2012 R2 and Server Core Virtual Machines Hardware Version VMWare Up to Version 10 Hyper-V Generation 1&2 Disaster Recovery as a Service Connectivity Full Duplex Internet connection 5Mb/s minimum IPSEC VPN NA For a complete list of hypervisor features supported when using DRaaSe, see: http://s3.amazonaws.com/zertodownload_docs/4.5U4/Zerto%20Virtual%20Replication%20Operability%20Matrix.pdf Getting Disaster Recovery as a Service up and running To get DRaaS up and running in your environment, follow the steps below: Create a recovery VDC Set up your local environment Configure networking on the recovery site Create a virtual protection group Perform a test failover Create a recovery VDC To recover your VMs to the UKCloud platform, you must have a VDC in the intended recovery site. If you already have a compute service in the UKCloud site, you can use an existing VDC or you can create a new one using: The UKCloud Portal (for more information see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware ) The UKCloud Portal API (for more information see the How to use the UKCloud Portal API ) If you don't already have a compute service in the UKCloud site or you'd prefer UKCloud to create the VDC for you, you can request this as part of your DRaaS Service Request. Set up your local environment Before you can start using DRaaS, you need to prepare your local environment by: Installing the appropriate version of Zerto Virtual Manager (ZVM) in your local environment Creating a secure site-to-site VPN between your local environment and the UKCloud platform For more information, see How to install and configure Zerto in your local environment . Configure networking on the recovery site You must configure any internally and externally routed networks in your UKCloud recovery VDC to duplicate those in your local environment. You must also configure the edge gateway with the same firewall, NAT and other rules. You'll create the mapping between these networks when you create your VPG (see How to create a virtual protection group ). In the event of a failover, external access to the recovery VDC will be via a different IP address. You'll need to account for any required DNS changes and external connectivity configuration (such as VPNs), to ensure continued external access. Utilising UKCloud's VMware platform, you can configure this in advance. Alternatively, you can use load balancing technologies to manage a seamless switch between environments. Create a virtual protection group A virtual protection group (VPG) is a collection of VMs that are grouped together for disaster recovery purposes. When you create a VPG, a replica of each VM disk is created on the recovery site. These replica virtual disks are then populated with the data in the protected VMs by synchronising the protected VMs with the recovery site replicas. For more information, see How to create a virtual protection group . Perform a test failover After you create your VPG, we recommend that you perform a test failover to confirm that your VMs will be recovered correctly in the event of a live failover. You should also run test failovers periodically to ensure that your VMs can still be recovered successfully. For more information, see How to perform a failover . Next steps You have now performed all the steps needed to set up DRaaS. If you experience a disaster, you can perform a live failover to recover your VMs on the UKCloud platform and continue operation as usual. For more information, see How to perform a failover .

    "keywords": "How to move resources between OpenStack regions Overview This article provides examples of how to move OpenStack resources (for example, instance images and volumes) between the different independent regions currently offered by UKCloud to help ensure the highest level of application resilience and availability. Intended audience Anyone responsible for the design and implementation of applications and services deployed on UKCloud OpenStack service, and should be familiar with using the OpenStack dashboard and API/CLI. Background UKCloud's OpenStack service has been engineered specifically for today's modern, digital, cloud based applications. Unlike our VMware service, OpenStack expects applications to be designed with resilience engineered at the application level, rather than relying upon the underlying cloud infrastructure. To cater for this, our OpenStack service offers the following two resiliency concepts: Regions - Where applications are served from a choice of multiple regions (for example, data centres) with each region having independent, isolated control (for example, dashboard, API), data (for example, compute workloads) and storage (for example, persistent block volumes) planes. Engineering your applications to span multiple regions offers the greatest level of resilience, however requires effort from a design and implementation perspective. Zones - Where applications are served from a single region (for example, data centre) and share a single control plane and resilient storage, however the data plane (for example, compute workloads) can be placed within different fault tolerant failure domains. Zones offer a lower level of resilience when compared to regions, however they require the least effort to utilise. UKCloud strongly recommends engineering across multiple regions for any production workloads. OpenStack regions & zones The following table outlines the regions and zones that are currently available on the OpenStack service: Site Region Zone Corsham 00005 (cor00005.cni.ukcloud.com) 0000c-1 0000c-2 Farnborough 00006 (frn00006.cni.ukcloud.com) 00021-1 00021-2 Details correct at date of publication. Current details can be found in the UKCloud Knowledge Centre. Migrating instances between regions UKCloud has deliberately engineered its regions to be fully independent to allow a high level of isolation and customer control as to which resources and data is shared/distributed. As a result, the only way to share instances between regions is to export them from the current region, then import them into the new region. The following provides a code example of how to achieve this export and import of an image using the OpenStack CLI: To identify the id of the source instance: Source the originating region's cred rc file Enter the following command: openstack server list Note the ID of your source instance as shown in the resulting output. To create the snapshot of the source instance, enter the following command: openstack server image create --name <snapshot-name> <id-of-server> Note the id shown in the resulting output. To check image has finished creating, enter the following command: openstack image show <id-of-image> Once complete, the status field should show as active . To download source image snapshot, enter the following command: glance image-download --file <output-location> --progress <id-of-image-to-download> To upload source image to the target region: Source the target region's cred rc file Enter the following command: glance image-create --progress --file <path-to-file-to-upload> --disk-format qcow2 --container-format bare --name <name-for-upload> You can now start the migrated instance from file you've just uploaded. Migrating volumes between regions As with instances, volumes have been engineered to be fully independent across regions. For moving volumes two options are available. Option 1 - Direct transfer between instances Once instances have been migrated (see above) and are running, data can be copied directly between the instances. To achieve this across different regions, the use of a VPN may be required. Details on how to deploy a VPN within the OpenStack platform can be found in Blueprint: Configuring IPsec VPN in UKCloud for OpenStack . Option 2 - Export and import of existing volumes Detach the volume to be migrated from all instances to ensure all writes are completed. a. To show a list of all volumes in your project: Source the originating region's cred rc file Enter the following command: openstack volume list If your source volume shows as being Attached to in the resulting output then note the ID of your source volume and proceed to step 1b, otherwise note the ID of your source volume and proceed to step 2. b. To detach your source volume from an instance, enter the following command: openstack server remove volume \\<server id\\> \\<volume id\\> Double check the volume has been detached by running the command in step 1a. Upload the source volume to the OpenStack Glance image repository using the following command: cinder --os-volume-api-version 2 upload-to-image <volume id> <name> Download the source volume image to your local device using the following command: glance image-download --file <output-location> --progress <id-of-image-to-download> To upload the source volume image to the target region: Source the target region's cred rc file Enter the following command: glance image-create --progress --file <path-to-file-to-upload> --disk-format qcow2 --container-format bare --name <name-for-upload> To create a new volume in the target region based upon the original source volume, enter the following command: openstack volume create --image <uploaded-image> --size <size-of-volume-to-create> --type <TIER1/TIER2> <Name> Next steps You can find more information about UKCloud's sites, regions and zones in the following Knowledge Centre articles: Understanding sites, regions and zones Sites, regions and zones map and reference table You can find full details for the OpenStack command-line interface (OpenStack CLI) at: https://access.redhat.com/webassets/avalon/d/Red_Hat_OpenStack_Platform-10-Command-Line_Interface_Reference_Guide-en-US/Red_Hat_OpenStack_Platform-10-Command-Line_Interface_Reference_Guide-en-US.pdf Feedback If you find an issue with this article, click Improve this Doc to suggest a change.

As of July 2015, UKCloud implemented an RHUI to provide automatic updates to our Red Hat customers on our Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL security domains. This provides benefits such as the reliable availability of patch updates and Red Hat approved OS templates. This update service replaces the previous repositories, which are no longer updated and were retired on the 31 August 2015. Prerequisites There are two pre-requisites for performing this operation: The host can resolve to the RHUI DNS records (contact Customer Support for the IP addresses and domain names for these records). You can achieve this by configuring an A record on your local DNS, or configuring an /etc/hosts file with the appropriate information. For Internet connectivity, the required domain name is in public DNS. All hosts using the service must be able to access the local RHUA server on port 443 (HTTPS). Ensure that the configured Security Groups allow outbound connectivity on port 443. If you have any questions on this, contact UKCloud Support. Installation You can find the installer RPM files in an ISO image. Before this can be mounted to an existing Instance, you will need to create a volume from the image. In the Horizon Web UI, locate the image UKCloud-RHUI-Standard-Assured.iso , click the action button and select Create Volume : Use the default settings presented by the dialog to copy the ISO to a 1GB TIER2 volume, and click Create Volume : Locate the Red Hat Instance where you wish to install RHUI support and select Attach Volume : Select the newly created volume and then click Attach Volume : Select the Instance name and check at the bottom of the Instance Overview to see that the volume is attached, and what its device name is: As root, mount the volume inside the VM, using the device name from step 5: Install the relevant RPM. For example, for RHEL7: rpm -ivh IL2-Client-RHEL7-Standard-2.0-1.noarch.rpm . Clean yum: yum clean all Test the RHUI is working: yum update The first time you update from RHUI you may be prompted to accept the following two certificates: The Red Hat entitlement certificate The Client entitlement certificate Troubleshooting The primary issues you may encounter are: DNS Failure Check the DNS lookup is working and you have the correct entry for Assured and Elevated. 443 not accessible Check your firewall configuration, including local firewalls ( iptables ) and edge gateway. Ensure you have the correct destination IP entry for Assured or Elevated. Incorrect version Ensure you have installed the correct RPM for your release.

    "keywords": "How to convert virtual machines to run in OpenStack Overview This article outlines the process for importing virtual machine (VM) images from other cloud or virtualisation platforms and run them on OpenStack's KVM hypervisor using the Linux virt-v2v tool. Intended audience This article is intended for operators who have the capability to download a VM image from their current hypervisor and upload images to UKCloud's OpenStack service. In addition, this article assumes that operators are familiar with Linux and its command line. Supported conversions You can use virt-v2v to convert VMs running the following operating systems to run on KVM: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.9 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 and later Windows XP Windows Vista Windows 7 Windows 8 Windows 8.1 Windows 10 Windows Server 2003 Windows Server 2008 Windows Server 2008 R2 Windows Server 2012 Windows Server 2012 R2 Windows Server 2016 Note virt-v2v may convert VMs running other Linux operating systems, such as Debian and Ubuntu, but these conversions are not supported. Conversions from the following hypervisors are supported: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 Xen VMware vSphere ESX / ESX(i) - versions 3.5, 4.0, 4.1, 5.0, 5.1, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 6.7 Note VMware appliances based on Photon OS are not supported and cannot be converted using virt-v2v . Converting virtual machines Download the VM image from your source hypervisor (please see your local instructions on how to perform this). Convert the source hypervisor image to an OpenStack KVM compatible image (QCOW2) using the following: For general instructions on how to use the virt-v2v tool, see the following page on the Red Hat Customer Portal: Converting Virtual Machines from Other Hypervisors to KVM with virt-v2v in RHEL 7 For specific instructions on how to export a guest VM from VMware as an OVA file and import it into KVM see the following page on the Red Hat Customer Portal: Export a guest virtual machine from VMware as an OVA file and import it into KVM Upload your new QCOW2 image to OpenStack (Glance) using the following steps: a. Log in to the UKCloud OpenStack region to which you want to upload your image. b. Expand the Compute menu on the left side of the Horizon dashboard and select Images . c. Click the Create Image button. d. In the Create Image page, browse for the image you want to import, complete the rest of the details on the page, then click Create Image. e. Depending on the size of the image, the import process may take up to an hour to complete. You can view progress of the import from the Images page of the OpenStack dashboard. When the import process is complete, you'll be able to use your newly imported image in the same way as any other image stored in OpenStack's image catalog (Glance). Note The above instructions assume you're using RHEL 7 to run the virt-v2v tool, however you can install the virt-v2v tool on other Linux operating systems. Next steps You can find more information about the virt-v2v tool on the official project page: http://libguestfs.org/virt-p2v.1.html If you're looking for a more managed migration service, you can engage with companies such as Cloudbase Solutions .

    "keywords": "How to configure an OpenStack instance using cloud-config Overview When you boot an instance in OpenStack you can pass configuration to the instance as cloud-config (sometimes called user-data). This enables you to quickly and easily make configuration changes at boot time. Use cases The following list provides some examples of how you can use cloud-config to configure an instance: Setting a default locale Setting an instance hostname Generating instance SSH private keys Adding SSH keys to a user's .ssh/authorized_keys so they can log in Setting up ephemeral mount points Configuring network devices Running config scripts at startup Example You can deploy cloud-config via the command line or via the OpenStack Horizon GUI. In this guide, we use the CLI, but you can use the same script via the GUI by pasting it into the Configuration tab. As an example, let's boot an instance and run some arbitrary commands at boot time. Create a new text file called user-data.txt . Add the following to the new file. #cloud-config runcmd: - mkdir -pv /root/cloud-config-test - touch /root/cloud-config-test/boottest - echo \"boot instance test\" >> /root/cloud-config-test/boottest Note You must include the #cloud-config line at the top of the file. Boot an instance using the CLI, adding --user-data user-data.txt to the end of the boot command. When the instance has booted, log into the instance, switch to root and look in the directory. You will see the new file, and it will contain boot instance test . This is a very simple example of what you can do with cloud-config, but you can see from this simple example that you can easily start to build fairly complicated setup scripts. Next steps You can find documentation for cloud-config at the following location: https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/examples.html Feedback If you find an issue with this article, click Improve this Doc to suggest a change.

    "title": "How to create a Service Fabric cluster using the UKCloud Azure Stack portal | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to create a Service Fabric cluster using the UKCloud Azure Stack portal Overview Azure Stack Service Fabric is a distributed systems platform that makes it easy to package, deploy, and manage scalable and reliable microservices and containers. Service Fabric also addresses the significant challenges in developing and managing cloud native applications. Developers and administrators can avoid complex infrastructure problems and focus on implementing mission-critical, demanding workloads that are scalable, reliable, and manageable. Service Fabric represents the next-generation platform for building and managing these enterprise-class, tier-1, cloud-scale applications running in containers. The following process shows you how to setup a Service Fabric cluster using the Azure Stack portal. Prerequisites To complete the steps in this guide, you must have appropriate access to a subscription in the Azure Stack portal. Creating a new key vault Before creating a Service Fabric cluster, it is necessary to create a key vault to store the certificates for the cluster. These certificates are used in Service Fabric to provide authentication and encryption to secure various aspects of a cluster and its applications. You can find more information about these certificates here . Log in to the Azure Stack portal. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for Microsoft Azure . In the favourites panel, select Create a resource . In the New blade, select Security + Identity . In the New blade, select Key Vault . In the Create key vault blade, enter the following information: Name - The name of the key vault. Subscription - This is your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure subscription. Resource Group - Select an existing resource group, or create a new one by typing a name for your new resource group. Location - This will be frn00006 , which is the location of the Azure Stack. Access policies - Configure who can access the key vault and what permissions they have. Click Create . You can monitor the progress of your Key Vault's deployment by clicking the Notifications icon. Adding a certificate to the key vault Once the key vault has been deployed, navigate to it by clicking All services in the favourites panel, then selecting Key Vaults under the Security + Identity section. Select your key vault from the list. In the Settings section of the key vault blade, select Secrets . On the Secrets page, click the + Generate/Import button. In the Create a secret blade, enter the following information: Upload Options - Select the Certificate option. Upload Certificate - Select the .pfx certificate to upload. Name - The name of the certificate to identify it within the Key Vault. Activation Date - Specifies when the certificate will become active. Expiration Date - Specifies when the certificate will become inactive. Enabled - Indicates whether or not the secret data can be retrieved. Click Create . Repeat as necessary, depending on how many certificates you require. Gathering key vault and certificate information During configuration of the Service Fabric cluster, you must provide several details relating to the key vault and certificates. You must also configure access to the key vault for virtual machines and the Azure Resource Manager. Once you have deployed the key vault, navigate to it by clicking All services in the favourites panel, then selecting Key Vaults under the Security + Identity section. Select your key vault from the list. In the Settings section of the key vault's blade, select Access Properties . On the Access policies page, click Click to show advanced access policies . Tick the top two check boxes, then click the Save button. In the Settings section of the key vault blade, select Properties . Copy the Resource ID and store it for later use. Select Secrets . On the Secrets page, select the certificate you added in the previous section. On the certificate's blade, select the current version. Copy the Secret Identifier . Repeat for each certificate that you are going to use for the Service Fabric cluster. You also need the thumbprint of the certificate(s). For information about how to find this information, see here . Create a Service Fabric cluster In the favourites panel, select Create a resource . In the search bar, search for Service Fabric Cluster . Select Service Fabric Cluster and click Create . In the Basics blade, enter the following information and click OK : Service Fabric Cluster Name - The name of your cluster. Node Type Prefix - Prefix for the name of each node (VM). Primary Node Type Size - Size of the VM scale set for the primary node type. Additional Node Type Sizes - For every additional node type, add an array with a count of the nodes in each node type. For example, if you want two additional node types with three nodes in each, enter 3,3 (separating the amount of nodes for each node type with a comma). Admin Username - The admin username for each node. Password - The admin password for each node. DNS Service - Select Yes to use DNS service, which is an optional system service that enables you to map DNS names to a service name and discover other services using the DNS protocol. If you have applications with existing URLs that you intend to use with Service Fabric, DNS service will help you use the standard DNS protocol (as an alternative to the Service Fabric Naming service) for resolving service names. Repair Manager - Select Yes to use Repair Manager to enable patch orchestration on node types with a durability of bronze, which helps keep your VMs up to date. Service Fabric deployment package URL - Specify the URL to download the Service Fabric deployment package from. For off-line scenarios, download the service fabric package from the URL specified and upload it to a blob and enable anonymous access and specify the URL here. Subscription - This is your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure subscription. Resource Group - Select an existing resource group, or create a new one by typing a name for your new resource group. Note that to create a Service Fabric cluster, the resource group must contain no other resources. Location - This will be frn00006 , which is the location of the Azure Stack. In the Network Settings blade, enter the following information and click OK : Service Fabric TCP Port - Service Fabric cluster TCP gateway port to use to connect using the Service Fabric client. Service Fabric HTTP Port - Service Fabric cluster HTTP gateway port to use to connect using the Service Fabric Explorer. Service Fabric Reverse Proxy Port - Service Fabric cluster reverse proxy port Custom Application Endpoints - Custom endpoints to open for connections to applications running on this cluster. Enter endpoints separated by commas, for example, 80,8080,8081 . Custom ports to open in the Network Security Group - Custom ports to open in the Network Security Group. Enter ports separated by commas, for example, 3389,80,8080,8081 . In the Node Configuration blade, enter the following information and click OK : Image SKU - The image template that each node is built from. VM Size - The size of each node. In the Security blade, enter the following information and click OK : Source Key Vault - The resource ID of the key vault that you gathered in the previous section. This should be in the format of /subscriptions/<SubscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<ResourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/<VaultName> .

    "keywords": "How to configure the Azure Stack user's Azure CLI environment In this article, we will guide you through the process of installing and using the Azure command-line interface (CLI) to manage Azure Stack. Azure CLI can be used to manage resources such as create virtual machines, deploy Azure Resource Manager templates, etc. Official Documentation Azure CLI command reference for 2018-03-01-hybrid profile Deploy templates with Azure CLI Important Azure Stack works with very specific API Profiles - you need to use 2018-03-01-hybrid in order to interact with it. The biggest caveat is that it only support as small subset of commands from the latest profile . Install CLI Sign in to your development workstation and install CLI. Azure Stack requires the 2.0 version of Azure CLI. You can install that by using the steps described in the Install Azure CLI 2.0 article. To verify if the installation was successful, open a terminal or a command prompt window and run the following command: az --version You should see the version of Azure CLI and other dependent libraries that are installed on your computer. Connect to Azure Stack Use the following steps to connect to Azure Stack: Register your Azure Stack environment by running the az cloud register command. To register the user environment, use: az cloud register \\ -n AzureStackUser \\ --endpoint-resource-manager \"https://management.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com\" \\ --suffix-storage-endpoint \"frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com\" \\ --suffix-keyvault-dns \".vault.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com\" \\ --endpoint-active-directory-graph-resource-id \"https://graph.windows.net/\" \\ To register the user environment - One Liner: az cloud register -n AzureStackUser --endpoint-resource-manager \"https://management.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com\" --suffix-storage-endpoint \"frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com\" --suffix-keyvault-dns \".vault.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com\" --endpoint-active-directory-graph-resource-id \"https://graph.windows.net/\" Set the active environment by using the following commands. For the user environment, use: az cloud set -n AzureStackUser Update your environment configuration to use the Azure Stack specific API version profile. To update the configuration, run the following command: az cloud update --profile 2018-03-01-hybrid Sign in to your Azure Stack environment by using the az login command. You can sign in to the Azure Stack environment either as a user or as a service principal . Sign in as a user : You can either specify the username and password directly within the az login command or authenticate by using a browser. You have to do the latter if your account has multi-factor authentication enabled. Example of username : Active directory global administrator or user account i.e. username@<aadtenant>.onmicrosoft.com or username@domain.com az login -u \"<username>@<tenantDomain>\" -p '<password>' Note If your user account has multi-factor authentication enabled, you can use the az login command without providing the -u parameter. Running the command gives you a URL and a code that you must use to authenticate. Sign in as a service principal : Before you sign in, create a service principal through the public Azure portal , PowerShell or CLI and assign it a role. Now, sign in by using the following command: az login \\ --tenant <Azure Active Directory Tenant name. For example: myazurestack.onmicrosoft.com> \\ --service-principal \\ -u <Application Id of the Service Principal> \\ -p <Key generated for the Service Principal> Verify that your environment is set correctly and that AzureStackUser is the active cloud. az cloud list --output table To list command subgroups run: az --help To list commands for specific subgroup run: az <subgroupname> --help Connect to Azure Stack - Quick Reference Guide # Create your environment az cloud register -n AzureStackUser --endpoint-resource-manager \"https://management.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com\" --suffix-storage-endpoint \"frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com\" --suffix-keyvault-dns \".vault.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com\" --endpoint-active-directory-graph-resource-id \"https://graph.windows.net/\" --profile 2018-03-01-hybrid # Set your environment az cloud set -n AzureStackUser # Log in to Azure Stack with user credentials az login -u \"<username>@<tenantDomain>\" -p '<password>' Test the connectivity Now that we've got everything setup, let's use CLI to create resources within Azure Stack.

Note You need to create your Resource Group first. admin-username and admin-password are given as examples above - these are the credentials which must be used to login to the VM once it is created. Known issues There are some known issues that you must be aware of when using CLI in Azure Stack: The CLI interactive mode i.e the az interactive command is not yet supported in Azure Stack. To get the list of virtual machine images available in Azure Stack, use the az vm images list --all command instead of the az vm image list command. Specifying the --all option makes sure that response returns only the images that are available in your Azure Stack environment. Virtual machine image aliases that are available in Azure may not be applicable to Azure Stack. When using virtual machine images, you must use the entire URN parameter (Canonical:UbuntuServer:14.04.3-LTS:1.0.0) instead of the image alias. This URN must match the image specifications as derived from the az vm images list command. Feedback If you find an issue with this article, click Improve this Doc to suggest a change.

    "keywords": "Access to virtual machines on the UKCloud platform What access does UKCloud have to our running virtual machines and the memory they are using? Our default policy is that no UKCloud personnel have access to any of our customer’s environments. We would need a specific, customer approved change ticket in order to gain access to a customers’ environment if we are to assist them with resolving any issues. UKCloud provides compute in line with the NIST defined IaaS cloud delivery model, which means that we manage the components up to and including the hypervisor, but we do not manage the virtual machine (VM) or anything within it (for example, the operating system or local disks). Each customer has complete autonomy in provisioning their VMs and therefore has exclusive control over the security credentials they use for each VM. As UKCloud does not have access to these security credentials, our personnel have no ability to authenticate and gain access to customer VMs. UKCloud personnel do have access to the vSphere hypervisors, physical servers and storage in which customer VMs run, so that they can effectively manage and maintain the cloud platform. This does not give them access to individual VMs, but rather the underlying resource pool. What controls do you have in place to prevent access to our data, either on disk or in memory? UKCloud was one of the first cloud service providers to achieve NCSC Pan Government Accreditation to host government data classified up to and including UK RESTRICTED (IL3 under the Government Protective Marking Scheme) and is one of the few cloud service providers who maintain PSN Accreditation, as well as the approval of the Health and Social Care Information Commission (HSCIC) to provide access to HSCN and Personally Identifiable Data. This heritage means that we have mature and well developed security controls throughout our organisation. This encompasses robust and multi-tiered physical, logical and technical security systems and controls. Given the low-level access that UKCloud personnel have to the cloud platform, we have implemented a variety of interconnected controls which include people, process and technology. We have a comprehensive Role Based Access Control (RBAC) system, which ensures that only authorised personnel can access appropriate elements of the cloud platform as required to undertake the authorised tasks of their role In addition, UKCloud is subject to regular ITSC CHECK Tests which provide a comprehensive and in-depth independent assessment of technical and security configurations, and check alignment of the assurance of UKCloud to Service Definitions, published RMADS and appropriate UK Government and industry standards. UKCloud maintains a protective monitoring service aligned with NCSC Good Practice Guidance GPG13 and the prescribed protective monitoring controls PMC1-12. This ensures that UKCloud has a comprehensive and detailed audit log, tracking which personnel have accessed and performed tasks on the cloud platform. All UKCloud personnel are appropriately vetted and security cleared so that customers can be assured that engineers with access to the underlying infrastructure are operating at the highest levels of trust (for example, through vetting and clearance frameworks including like BPSS, SC, DV and NPPV). UKCloud benefits from a full-time internal compliance function, which regularly audits company functions and processes to assess whether they are being correctly followed (for example by maintaining clear evidence where customers request and permit UKCloud to access their VMs). Any non-conformance is documented, reported to Board Level, and followed up to ensure that effective remedial actions are implemented. Finally, to complement the high levels of security inherent within the UKCloud platform, UKCloud recommends that customers use appropriate controls within the VM or application, such as data at rest encryption (for example, Bitlocker or Becrypt), session encryption (for example, HTTPS or VPN), and the implementation of appropriate protective monitoring. UKCloud has produced extensive security collateral to explain how we provide an assured cloud platform, including our Government Security Classification Policy whitepaper, relevant evidence packs and RMADS.

    "title": "How to perform a failover | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to perform a failover Overview You may want to perform a failover in the following circumstances: To recover virtual machines (VMs) after a disaster, if you're using Disaster Recovery as a Service or the UKCloud for VMware Journaling Protection option To migrate workloads from a local, on-premises environment onto the UKCloud platform With Disaster Recovery as a Service and Journaling Protection, you can also run a test failover to verify that, during recovery, your protected VMs are correctly replicated at the target site. Important During the failover process, any change in the configuration or state of the live or failed‑over VMs (for example, power on or power off) will cause failure of the failover and may corrupt the VPG. This could make a full resync necessary and, in a disaster recovery situation, could prevent failover completely. Intended audience To perform the steps in this guide you need access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal (ZSSP) in the target zone. Running a test failover If you use Disaster Recovery as a Service or Journaling Protection, you should periodically run test failovers to verify that, in the case of a live failover, your VMs can be recovered successfully. When you run a test failover, a test VM is created for each of your protected VMs in a sandbox on the target site, using the test network specified in the virtual protection group (VPG). During the test, your VMs' journals continue to be updated and new checkpoints generated, ensuring that your VMs remain protected and can be fully recovered in the event of an actual live failover. Note When the test failover has been instantiated, Zerto will automatically start up the test failover VMs. It is critically important that you do not power on (or power off) the VMs manually in vCloud Director before the failover is completely instantiated. Changing the state of the VMs in vCloud Director before the failover process is complete will result in corruption of the VPG. If you power off a failed-over VMs while a test failover is in progress, replication of live VMs will be affected. Log in to the ZSSP. For more detailed instructions, see How to access the Zerto Self-Service Portal . Use the ZSSP login link for the zone in which your target VDC is located. At the bottom of the page, make sure that the failover toggle is set to TEST and click FAILOVER . In the Failover Test wizard, in the SELECT VPGs page, select one or more VPGs that you want to test then click NEXT . The EXECUTION PARAMETERS page shows the most recent checkpoint added to the journal. If you want to use a different checkpoint for the test, click the Checkpoint time. In the Checkpoints dialog, select the checkpoint that you want to use: Latest to use the latest checkpoint Latest Tagged Checkpoint to use the latest manually added checkpoint Latest VSS to use the latest VSS snapshot (this option is applicable only for Disaster Recovery as a Service and if you've installed the Zerto VSS agent on the VM) Select from all available checkpoints to select a specific checkpoint from the list below Click OK then click NEXT . In the FAILOVER TEST page, review the diagram to see the number of VPGs and VMs included in the test and where they will be recovered to, then click START FAILOVER TEST . The test begins with an initialisation period, during which the VMs are created in scratch volumes on the target site. You can check the status of the test by clicking the VPG Name on the VPGs tab. To stop the test, on the VPGs tab, click the VPG Name and click the Stop test icon. In the Stop Test dialog, from the Result list, choose whether the test succeeded or failed, then click STOP . You can also provide additional Notes to describe the test scenario. After you stop the test, the test VMs are powered off and removed. Running a live failover In the event of a disaster, you'll need to run a live failover to recover your VMs. You can also use live failover to migrate your workloads to the target site. Note When the failover has been instantiated, Zerto will automatically start up the failover VMs. It is critically important that you do not power on (or power off) the VMs manually in vCloud Director before the failover is completely instantiated. Changing the state of the VMs in vCloud Director before the failover process is complete will result in corruption of the VPG and potentially the failure of the disaster recovery process. Log in to the ZSSP. For more detailed instructions, see How to access the Zerto Self-Service Portal . Use the ZSSP login link for the zone in which your target VDC (for recovery or migration) is located. At the bottom of the page, make sure that the failover toggle is set to LIVE and click FAILOVER . In the Failover wizard, in the SELECT VPGs page, select one or more VPGs that you want to failover or migrate then click NEXT . Tip The red border around the wizard provides a visual cue that you are performing a live failover, rather than a test. The EXECUTION PARAMETERS page shows the most recent checkpoint added to the journal. If you want to use a different checkpoint, click the Checkpoint time. In the Checkpoints dialog, select the checkpoint that you want to use: Latest to use the latest checkpoint Latest Tagged Checkpoint to use the latest manually added checkpoint Latest VSS to use the latest VSS snapshot (this option is applicable only for Disaster Recovery as a Service and Migration to the Cloud, and if you've installed the Zerto VSS agent on the VM) Select from all available checkpoints to select a specific checkpoint from the list below Click OK . The commit policy gives you the opportunity to check the integrity of the recovered or migrated VMs before committing the failover. To change the commit policy, select the Commit Policy field and choose: Auto-Commit if you want to automatically commit the failover after a specified amount of time if there is no user interaction. Set the amount of time in the After field, up to a maximum of 1440 minutes (24 hours). If you want the failover to be immediately committed, enter 0. Auto-Rollback if you want to automatically roll back the failover after a specified amount of time if there is no user interaction. Set the amount of time in the After field, up to a maximum of 1440 minutes (24 hours). If you want the failover to be immediately rolled back, enter 0. None if you do not want to apply a commit policy. You must manually commit or roll back the failover. The shutdown policy determines what happens to the source VMs in the event of a failover. To change the shutdown policy, select the VM Shutdown field and choose: No to leave the source VMs as they are before starting the failover. Yes if the source VMs have VMware Tools available so that they can be gracefully shut down before starting the failover or migration. If the VMs cannot be shut down, the failover fails. Force Shutdown to forcibly shut down the source VMs before starting the failover. Reverse protection ensures that when the source VMs are failed over to the target site, the source site becomes the new target site to ensure that the VMs are still protected. To enable reverse protection, select the Reverse Protection field and select the check box. Important Reverse protection uses the original source VM's virtual disks to pre‑seed the reverse replication, therefore enabling reverse protection will make changes to the source VMs. Click NEXT . In the FAILOVER page, review the diagram to see the number of VPGs and VMs included in the failover and where they will be recovered or migrated to, then click START FAILOVER . The failover process creates the VMs in the target site to the selected point in time. Note If a VM already exists on the target site with the same name as one of the source VMs, a number is added to the end of the recovered or migrated VM name to ensure that it's unique. If you set a commit policy with a time greater than zero, you can check the integrity of the recovered or migrated VMs before committing (or rolling back) the failover. When you've finished testing, you can either wait for the time to elapse before the auto‑commit or auto‑rollback, or on the VPGs tab, click the VPG Name and then click the Commit or Rollback icon as required. Note As soon as a live failover is committed, the journal is destroyed and you cannot go back and select a different checkpoint. However, provided reverse protection is not enabled, the original VMs on the source site remain in place. When the commit is completed, the VPG will show as being in Needs Configuration state. When in this state, editing the VPG configuration may cause reverse protection to begin. If this is not desired, then you should delete VPG as soon as it reaches the Needs Configuration state. Next steps Your VMs are now running in the target site, which is now your primary site. For Disaster Recovery as a Service and Journaling Protection, to return to the source site (or a different site) after the disaster has been resolved, perform a failover to move them to the source site. For Migration to the Cloud, as soon as you are happy with how your workloads are running in on the UKCloud platform, you can tidy up the source environment.

    "keywords": "How to migrate your workloads between UKCloud regions Overview Journaling Protection is a powerful, self-service replication and recovery tool that can help you improve your organisational resilience. However, you can also use UKCloud's Journaling Protection solution to migrate your UKCloud for VMware applications into another UKCloud for VMware-enabled zone. This enables you to move your workloads into the regions within the UKCloud platform that are best suited for their requirements. Our Migration service is powered by Zerto, a leading provider of disaster recovery software for the cloud. The migration of VMs within the UKCloud platform is very closely aligned to the disaster recovery of VMs within UKCloud; the small difference being that when you have failed-over the VMs from one region into another, you don't then failback to your primary region. As such, you'll find that the articles linked to from this article refer to disaster recovery and failover, however the steps also apply to migration. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide, you need to have access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal. Before you begin When you request Journaling Protection to migrate a workload within the UKCloud platform, UKCloud provides you with: A ZORG ID to identify your environment within Zerto Access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal (ZSSP), where you can create and manage your VPGs You should consider the following: Migration is provided on a vApp basis (not for individual VMs). This is worth considering if you intend to migrate only some parts of your vApps. VMs must be powered on to be synchronised prior to migration. Our Journaling Protection service option captures every action. When a VM is deleted from your vApp, the associated journal is also deleted. This means if you delete a VM before migrating it, that VM will not exist in your target region. We provide a single default service profile. The details of this are available in the Journaling Protection Service Scope . We do not currently provide the option for you to create custom profiles Migrating workloads between UKCloud regions You begin the migration process for your VMs by adding Journaling Protection to the vApp that contains those VMs. This creates something called a virtual protection group (VPG). Each VM in the protected vApp is synchronised to the target migration region and a journal is created. After this initial synchronisation, each subsequent write operation to the VM is processed as normal on the source region and a copy is asynchronously sent to the target region and written to the journal. Each journal entry exists in the journal for a specified number of days (the journal history). When the journal history is reached, as new journal entries are created, older entries are written to the migration target VM's virtual disks. Every few seconds, a checkpoint is written to every journal for each VM in the VPG to ensure crash-consistency between the VMs. When you're ready to migrate a VM, you select a checkpoint to recover to. This isn't strictly necessary for workload migration, but is a feature associated with the Journaling Protection aspect of Zerto. It means that you'll have a known point at which the VM will be restarted from in the new region. During migration, the vApp and its VMs are created on the target region and the recovery disks for each VM are attached to the migrated VM. Information in the journal is then promoted to the VM to bring it up to the date and time of the selected checkpoint. The process for getting Journaling Protection up and running ready for workload migration within the UKCloud platform is as follows: Create a migration VDC Configure networking in the migration target VDC Create a virtual protection group in the primary region Perform a test migration Migrate your workloads Create a migration VDC To migrate your workloads to a different UKCloud region, you must have a VDC in the intended target region. If you already have a compute service in the target region, you can use an existing VDC or you can create a new one using: The UKCloud Portal - For more information see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware The UKCloud Portal API -- For more information see How to use the UKCloud Portal API If you don't already have a compute service in the target region or you'd prefer UKCloud to create the VDC for you, you can request this as part of your Journaling Protection service request. Configure networking in the migration target VDC You must configure any internally and externally routed networks in your migration target environment to duplicate those in the source region. You must also configure the edge gateway with the same firewall, NAT and other rules. You'll create the mapping between these networks when you create your VPG; see How to create a virtual protection group . When you initially migrate your workloads, external access to the target region will be via a different IP address. If you want to keep the same IP addresses for your new environment, you'll need to request an IP move from UKCloud. We'll move the IPs from your old edge to your new edge. Note that you should raise this service request in good time so we can move the IPs as soon as you need us to. Alternatively, you can use the new allocation of IP addresses in your new environment. You don't need to configure vApp networks in advance as they'll be replicated within the VPG. Create a virtual protection group in the primary region A VPG is a collection of VMs that are grouped together for migration. As workload migration within the UKCloud platform uses Journaling Protection, VPGs are created from vApps. When you create a VPG, you specify the vApp you want to migrate and all the VMs in that vApp are replicated. For example, in a standard three-tier application, you'll likely have three VMs: one for your application, one for the database and one for the web server. As best practice, you should create these three related VMs in a single vApp, which you can then add to a VPG so that all the VMs are migrated together. For more information, see How to create a virtual protection group . This guide is the same for both failovers and migrations. Perform a test migration After you create your VPG, we recommend that you perform a test migration to confirm that your VMs will be recovered correctly when you do the real migration. For more information, see How to perform a failover . This guide is the same for both failovers and migrations. Migrate your workloads If you are happy with your test migration, you can now choose when to migrate your environment from your primary region into your new region. You don't have to migrate everything in one go; you can choose which VPGs you migrate and you can perform a staged migration. Within Zerto, you have two options for migrating your workloads: Move the VPG to the target region. This method performs and end-to-end migration, including removing the VMs from the source region after they've been moved. For more information, see the steps below. Perform a live migration. This method provides more flexibility for you to control what happens in the primary region after you move the VMs to the target region. For more information, see How to perform a failover . To move a VPG: Log in to ZSSP. If you need more detailed instructions, see How to access the Zerto Self-Service Portal . Use the ZSSP login link for the zone in which your target VDC is located. From the ACTIONS menu at the bottom of the page, choose MOVE VPG . In the Move wizard, on the Select VPGs page, select one or more VPGs that you want to move then click NEXT . On the EXECUTION PARAMETERS page, the commit policy gives you the opportunity to check the integrity of the migrated VMs before committing the move. To change the commit policy, select the Commit Policy field and choose: Auto-Commit if you want to automatically commit the move after a specified amount of time if there is no user interaction. Set the amount of time in the After field, up to a maximum of 1440 minutes (24 hours). If you want the move to be immediately committed, enter 0. Auto-Rollback if you want to automatically roll back the move after a specified amount of time if there is no user interaction. Set the amount of time in the After field, up to a maximum of 1440 minutes (24 hours). If you want the move to be immediately rolled back, enter 0. None if you do not want to apply a commit policy. You must manually commit or roll back the move. The source VMs must be powered off before they can be migrated. If the VMs cannot be gracefully shut down, you can force a shutdown. To force shutdown, select the Force Shutdown check box. If you do not select this option and the VMs cannot be gracefully shut down, the move process fails. Reverse protection ensures that when the source VMs are migrated to the target region, the source region becomes the new target region. Reverse protection is enabled by default, but you should disable it by clicking the Reverse Protection field and deselecting the REVERSE check box. Click NEXT . On the MOVE page, review the diagram to see the number of VPGs and VMs included in the move and where they will be moved to, then click START MOVE . The move process creates the VMs in the target region. Note If a VM already exists on the target region with the same name as one of the source VMs, a number is added to the end of the target VM name to ensure that it is unique. If you set a commit policy with a time greater than zero, you can check the integrity of the migrated VMs before committing (or rolling back) the migration. When you've finished testing, you can either wait for the time to elapse before the auto commit or auto rollback, or on the VPGs tab, click the VPG Name and then click the Commit or Rollback icon as required. After the migrated VMs are up and running and committed in the target region, the powered off VMs in the source region are removed from the source region and data from the journal is promoted to the migrated VMs. You should have disabled reverse protection to stop your migrated VMs from being protected on the source region. Next steps After you've completed the migration, you can continue working with your applications as before. If you used failover to migrate your workloads, when you've determined that the migration has been successful, you should remove the original VMs from the source region to remove any workloads that are no longer required. You can use Journaling Protection to protect your newly migrated VMs by replicating to another region within UKCloud. Note While you can set up Journaling Protection for migration purposes in regions 1 and 2, the target environment for Journaling Protection for failover is available only in regions 5 and 6.

    "keywords": "How to install and configure Zerto in your local environment Overview If you want to use UKCloud's Disaster Recovery as a Service or Migration to the Cloud services, there are some tasks that you must perform to prepare your local environment. UKCloud's Disaster Recovery as a Service enables you to provide a secure, scalable disaster recovery solution for your on-premises environment by replicating your workloads on the UKCloud platform Migration to the Cloud enables you to move your workloads from a local, on-premises environment onto the UKCloud platform. Our Disaster Recovery as a Service and Migration to the Cloud services are powered by Zerto, a leading provider of disaster recovery software for the cloud, so you'll need to install Zerto software in your local environment to enable the replication of your workloads to the UKCloud platform. You'll also need to create a IPsec VPN to connect your local environment to the UKCloud. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide, you must have administrator access to the vCenter Server that hosts the VMs that you want to protect or migrate. Before you begin When you raise a Service Request for Disaster Recovery as a Service or Migration to the Cloud, UKCloud provides you with: A ZORG ID to identify your environment within Zerto A link to the appropriate version of Zerto Virtual Manager (ZVM) for you to deploy in your local environment as well as a site address and port for licensing purposes The IP address (from the IP range you provided to UKCloud) of the Zerto Cloud Connector (ZCC) deployed in your target VDC (for recovery or migration); you'll need this to complete the setup of the site-to-site VPN between your local environment and your target VDC Access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal (ZSSP) in the UKCloud zone where your target VDC is located Installing and configuring Zerto Virtual Manager in your local environment As UKCloud's Disaster Recovery as a Service and Migration to the Cloud services are powered by Zerto, you need to set up Zerto Virtual Manager (ZVM) in your local environment to enable your VMs to be replicated on the UKCloud platform. ZVM is responsible for all the Zerto configuration for a site and performs the replication tasks. UKCloud provides a version of ZVM that is compatible with the Zerto software on the UKCloud platform. Download and run the executable file from the link provided by UKCloud. Note Install ZVM on a Windows 2008r2 or 2012r2 server, ideally with nothing else running on it. On the Welcome page of the Zerto Virtual Replication Installation for VMware vSphere wizard, read the information provided then click NEXT . On the License Agreement page, accept the agreement and then click NEXT . On the Select Installation Folder/Directory page, change the location if necessary and then click NEXT . On the Choose Installation Type page, select Express installation and then click NEXT . On the vCenter Server Connectivity page, in the IP / Host Name field, enter the address of the vCenter Server that hosts the VMs that you want to protect or migrate. In the Username and Password fields, enter the administrator credentials for the vCenter Server. In the Site Name field, enter a name to identify the location of this installation of ZVM and then click NEXT . On the Validation page, fix any issues if necessary and then click RUN . After ZVM has finished installing, on the Install Complete page, select the Open the Zerto Virtual Manager interface checkbox and then click DONE . Log in to the Virtual Manager Web Client using your vCenter Server administrator credentials. The first time you log in, you'll need to enter licensing details. As you are using ZVM as part of a UKCloud service, select Pair to a site with a license and enter the Site Address and Port provided by UKCloud. Click START . In ZVM, select the SETUP tab. Click NEW VRA . The Virtual Replication Appliance (VRA) manages the replication of VMs across the two sites. In the Configure and Install VRA dialog, from the Host list, select the IP address of the server that hosts the VMs that you want to protect or migrate. In the Host Root Password field, enter the root password of the VM host server. Complete the other fields in the Host Details section as required. In the VRA Network Details section, enter a static IP address and the gateway details of the network for the VRA to use. Click Install . After the VRA has finished installing, you should be able to see your new VRA in the SETUP tab. Creating a VPN between your local environment and UKCloud As you'll be replicating your VMs from your local environment onto the UKCloud platform, you need to create a secure connection between the two sites. You can do this by creating a site-to-site VPN. For information about how to create a site-to-site VPN, see How to configure IPsec VPN . The following table lists the minimum firewall rules required for Zerto to pair and replicate with the UKCloud platform.

    "title": "Understanding UKCloud's Identity & Access Management API | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Understanding UKCloud's Identity & Access Management API UKCloud's Identity & Access Management API (IDAM) enables you to manage user access to products within your account. Adding a user to a group changes which permissions they have. Full documentation for the IDAM API is available on SwaggerHub . Typical usage To add a user to a permission group, you first need to list the users and permission groups to find the IDs for both. Then you can use those IDs to add the user to the appropriate group. Prerequisites This article provides examples using curl and jq . Authentication Before you begin, you'll need to retrieve a single sign-on token to authenticate with IDAM. For ease of use, this is saved to a variable token in your current shell session using the below command. token=$(curl -X POST \"https://idp.ukcloud.com/auth/realms/client-assured/protocol/openid-connect/token\" \\ -d username=\"<username>\" \\ -d password=\"<password>\" \\ -d grant_type=password \\ -d client_id=portal.ukcloud | jq -r '.access_token') This token is used in bearer authentication with IDAM. Requests to the IDAM API are prefaced with curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $token\" . Listing users The first step would be to find the ID of the user whose permissions you wish to edit. The below command lists all users you are entitled to manage with their IDs and usernames. Take a note of your target user's ID. curl -s -H \"Authorization: Bearer $token\" https://idam.ukcloud.com/v1/users | jq -r '.[] | .id + \" \" + .username' Listing groups The next step is to find the ID of the permission you would like to give or take from the user. These are known as groups internally to IDAM. The below command lists all groups you are entitled to manage with their IDs and names. curl -s -H \"Authorization: Bearer $token\" https://idam.ukcloud.com/v1/groups | jq -r '.[].subGroups[] | .id + \" \" + .name' Adding a user to a group To give a user a particular permission, use the IDs that you have found to make a request to grant the user that permission. You can add a user to a group with this PUT request. Expect a response code of 204 if this is successful. curl -X PUT -H \"Authorization: Bearer $token\" https://idam.ukcloud.com/v1/users/{{user_id}}/groups/{{group_id}} Removing a user from a group A DELETE request, as opposed to a PUT request, will remove a permission from a user by removing them from a group. You can remove a user from a group with this DELETE request. Expect a response code of 204 if this is successful. curl -X DELETE -H \"Authorization: Bearer $token\" https://idam.ukcloud.com/v1/users/{{user_id}}/groups/{{group_id}} Feedback If you find an issue with this article, click Improve this Doc to suggest a change.

    "title": "Understanding the difference between GB and GiB | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Understanding the difference between GB and GiB Overview This article provides information about disk capacity and explains when viewed by an operating system, why the capacity of a drive differs from what is reported by a vendor. Why is this important? When purchasing disk drives, 1 GB is often defined as 1,000,000,000 bytes. However, when viewed by an operating system, the capacity displayed is often less than this. For example, a new 1 TB hard drive would be reported by the OS as 931 GB (this is 931 GiB). GiB (Gibibytes) is a standard unit used in the field of data processing and transmission and is defined as base 1024 rather than base 1000. For example, 1 GB is defined as 1000³ bytes, whereas 1 GiB is defined as 1024³ bytes. Unit of measure Bytes Kilobyte (KB) 1000¹ = 1,000 Megabyte (MB) 1000² = 1,000,000 Gigabyte (GB) 1000³ = 1,000,000,000 Terabyte (TB) 1000⁴ = 1,000,000,000,000 Petabyte (PB) 1000⁵ = 1,000,000,000,000,000 Kibibyte (KiB) 1024¹ = 1,024 Mebibyte (MiB) 1024² = 1,048,576 Gibibyte (GiB) 1024³ = 1,073,741,824 Tebibyte (TiB) 1024⁴ = 1,099,511,627,776 Pebibyte (PiB) 1024⁵ = 1,125,899,906,842,624 How is this converted? GB to GiB Multiply by (1000³ / 1024³), equivalent to 0.931323 Divide by this value to go from GiB to GB TB to TiB Multiply by (1000⁴ / 1024⁴), equivalent to 0.909495 Divide by this value to go from TiB to TB GiB to TiB Divide by 1024 Multiply by 1024 to go from TiB to GiB GiB to TB Convert into GB by dividing by 0.931323, then divide by 1000 to get into TB Examples of conversions 1 GB = 0.93 GiB 1 TB = 0.91 TiB = 931 GiB 1 TiB = 1.1 TB = 1100 GB Full worked example Example customer has two disks in each server, with each disk capacity being 2.2 TB SSD. Therefore, the total drive size equals 4.4 TB or 4.001777 TiB which across 100 hosts would mean the capacity totals 440 TB or 400.1777 TiB. The monthly charge would therefore be 400.1777 TiB, which when multiplied by 1024 to convert into GiB is 409,781.9 GiB. At a rate of 10p/GiB, the monthly charge would be £40,978.19 per month, equating to £409.78 per server. To illustrate the difference between GiB and GB, if we charged at a rate of 10p/GB (instead of GiB) then you would be charged for 440,000 GB which equates to a total cost of £44,000 or £440 per server. This provides a significant price difference of £3,121.81 per month, a 7.6% increase in cost. By pricing our services at £/GiB you will be charged for around 93% of the total cost had prices been listed per GB.

    "keywords": "External security review testing Overview All UKCloud services, and their underlying infrastructure are suitable for supporting OFFICIAL and OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE data. We achieve this via a robust risk management system that meets stringent requirements and best practice industry standards. We also complete a comprehensive IT Security Health Check of the entire infrastructure, undertaken by an external assessment organisation, on a regular basis. UKCloud has implemented all 14 NCSC Cloud Security Principles. However, to ensure that you are able to meet your own legislative, regulatory and/or contractual requirements, UKCloud provides a service to assist customers in undertaking appropriate security reviews of the services above the underlying platform. In this way, we will co-operate with reasonable requests in arranging, conducting and reviewing the results of such reviews and/or tests. Important Within the terms and conditions of the service (full details included with the application form), you (and any third parties or agents you engage) must treat any results or information of these tests as confidential, safeguard it accordingly and not disclose any confidential information belonging to the other party. Further, any activities or testing performed outside of the agreed scope will be treated as malicious and/or unauthorised activity which may result in a breach of contract, service cessation and legal consequences. If you have any questions relating to UKCloud's policies and procedures in place to mitigate risk within the underlying platform, contact us for further information. Confidential information includes, but is not limited to all commercial, marketing, financial, technical, security, personnel, operational and similar information, including trade secrets, \"know how\", brand marks, trademarks and other proprietary information. This article provides useful information for undertaking appropriate security reviews of your services above the underlying UKCloud platform. It highlights the notice requirement for performing penetration tests, and provides access to the form that you must complete before arrangements can be made. Service scope As above, the underlying technology platform supporting UKCloud's services and customer management tools, for example the UKCloud Portal, are fully tested for our Assured and Elevated security domains. You will therefore be testing from a cloud consumer rather than a cloud management perspective. Within UKCloud for VMware, the platform extends to the perimeter of the your vCloud organisation with the edge gateway acting as the boundary. An example of this is depicted in the diagram below and therefore the edge gateway, along with everything to the right, is your responsibility and can be included within the scope of your security test. Engagement and operation of tests UKCloud will cooperate with you to support external penetration testing requirements, subject to four (4) working days' notice being given as long as the following activities have been completed. To request permission to perform a test, you must: Raise a Service Request within the UKCloud Portal for the test. Complete the External Security Review Test (ESRT) application form (UKC-FRM-231 - available on request) and attach the completed document ( in full ) to your Service Request. If you want to share any other relevant information (for example, a formal scope), you should also attach this to your Service Request. On receipt of the Service Request and ESRT form, UKCloud will review the submission at the next possible Change Advisory Board (CAB) and provide an update in the Service Request, either: Where the request is approved, to convey technical authority to proceed with the test at the date and time specified, and in accordance with the documented testing scope Where the request is not approved, to convey the result and the reasons for it, enabling you to decide whether to withdraw or resubmit the request Note If testing is to be conducted in both Assured and Elevated security domains, you must complete separate requests for each system. Important If the resultant ESRT form contains RESTRICTED content and cannot be emailed, contact our support team for alternative communication methods. Testing access points Customers may test from two locations: External (from outside the virtual environment) – Tests are to be carried out external to the UKCloud data centres and offices from the perspective of the internet or government networks. These tests will traverse UKCloud's physical network edge, and enter your vCloud organisation through the edge gateway. Internal (from inside the virtual environment) – Tests are to be carried out external to the UKCloud data centres and offices from the perspective of the internet or government networks. It is expected that you would provision a virtual machine (VM) within your vCloud organisation to act as a launch-pad for testing. Any testers would then upload relevant tools to this VM to execute tests within your organisation. If you don't have a compute service prior to testing to use for this purpose, you can provision a new compute service, which will be billed under as normal consumption. Pricing For a test to commence, UKCloud must complete a number of administrative tasks to facilitate the activity. This may result in a cost, chargeable as one day's work from the UKCloud SFIA rate card (Level 4 - Enable). In some circumstances, additional time may be required but this will be outlined prior to tests commencing.

    "keywords": "Cloud Economics Pricing for virtual machines (VMs) provided by UKCloud, is based on actual consumption (per VM, per hour, per GB per month). It's essential that you base your cloud solution on predicted usage rather than your predicted peak demand for example, as you might when specifying traditional solutions. To help you specify your cloud solution, you should consider the following: What's the ramp up period from zero to full utilisation? If your business-as-usual solution requires 50 servers and your go-live is in six months’ time, it's likely that you might only need five servers in month one and 15 in month two for example. Do all the servers have to run all the time? As VMs are charged by the hour, you can make significant savings by turning off your VMs when they are not needed (for example, overnight or during weekends). Would you benefit from an annual subscription? For those VMs that need to run 24/7, you should consider a 12-month subscription which would mean charges for those VMs will benefit from a discount. Some non-production environments might only be required during certain times of the project/year. So if you only need a UAT environment one week per month, be sure to factor that in when estimating your hourly costs. Are your servers right-sized? It's very easy to increase the processing, memory or storage resources of your servers; you may want to start small and scale up as and when you need more capacity instead of starting big and leaving those resources under-utilised. Do you need those redundant VMs? Our platform offers inherent resilience to mitigate hardware failure and even site failure. Be sure you need redundancy at the application layer before you add in the additional cost by provisioning redundant VMs. Do you need dedicated blades to comply with application licensing requirements? UKCloud offers a variety of service options for compute resources, refer to the relevant service definitions and pricing guide for more information.

    "keywords": "How to remove access rights from Single Sign-On (SSO) users Overview When you use the UKCloud Portal to remove a user from an account that includes SSO-enabled services, it's important to note that this does not remove access rights from the corresponding SSO user. To remove the SSO user's access, you must use the Identity & Access Management (IDAM) API to remove that user from all IDAM groups. SSO-enabled services are: UKCloud for OpenShift UKCloud for OpenStack For more information about the IDAM API, see Understanding UKCloud's Identity & Access Management API . Removing access rights from an SSO user The process for using the IDAM API to remove access rights from an SSO user is as follows: Authenticate with the IDAM API: token=$(curl -X POST \"https://idp.ukcloud.com/auth/realms/client-assured/protocol/openid-connect/token\" \\ -d username=\"<username>\" \\ -d password=\"<password>\" \\ -d grant_type=password \\ -d client_id=portal.ukcloud | jq -r '.access_token') This returns an SSO token to use for authenticating calls to the IDAM API. For example: { \"access_token\": \"eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCIgOiAiSldUIiwia2lkIiA6ICJUU0F1WERTWUt0SGVEWTI5ZHlPVFZVeHZUMWNhYmUyNUpEVVZzajhVRUhrIn0.eyJqdGkiOiI2YWJmYzkw...\", \"expires_in\": 300, \"refresh_expires_in\": 1800, \"refresh_token\": \"eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCIgOiAiSldUIiwia2lkIiA6ICJUU0F1WERTWUt0SGVEWTI5ZHlPVFZVeHZUMWNhYmUyNUpEVVZzajhVRUhrIn0.eyJqdGkiOiIyMDkyNjA0...\", \"token_type\": \"bearer\", \"not-before-policy\": 0, \"session_state\": \"342ab476-d286-41b9-8b3a-1a236cceefc1\" } For convenience, the token is saved to the token variable in your current shell session. Use this variable in the Authorization: Bearer header for all further calls to the IDAM API. List users and note the ID of the user you want to remove: curl -s -H \"Authorization: Bearer $token\" https://idam.ukcloud.com/v1/users | jq -r '.[] | .id + \" \" + .username' The jq filter on this request returns a list of SSO users and their IDs: 0744f665-2d7a-483c-adb3-72b0effe2356 acc1admin 1d9e52e6-f833-47b9-9cfa-be727510c910 acc1usr1 a089698b-8f32-4a32-ab71-790b015aa662 acc1usr2 Find the user that you want to remove and make a note of that user's ID. For example, to remove the user acc1usr2 , you would need the ID a089698b-8f32-4a32-ab71-790b015aa662 . Tip If you will have to remove the user from multiple groups, you may find it helpful to store this ID in a variable. List all the groups that you have permission to manage: curl -s -H \"Authorization: Bearer $token\" https://idam.ukcloud.com/v1/groups | jq -r '.[].subGroups[] | .id + \" \" + .name' The jq filter on this request returns a list of groups: 008d3512-54f9-439e-800a-7b0b5ef76438 idam:Account_101#User a4ebc856-222f-4686-a4bf-239c21ffa010 idam:Account_101#Admin Make a note of the IDs of all the groups. The example above lists two groups: idam:Account_101#User with the ID 008d3512-54f9-439e-800a-7b0b5ef76438 idam:Account_101#Admin with the ID a4ebc856-222f-4686-a4bf-239c21ffa010 Remove the user from each group by making a DELETE request for that user against each group. curl -X DELETE -H \"Authorization: Bearer $token\" https://idam.ukcloud.com/v1/users/{{user_id}}/groups/{{group_id}} For example, to remove the SSO user acc1usr2 , you would need to make two calls: curl -X DELETE -H \"Authorization: Bearer $token\" https://idam.ukcloud.com/v1/users/a089698b-8f32-4a32-ab71-790b015aa662/groups/008d3512-54f9-439e-800a-7b0b5ef76438 curl -X DELETE -H \"Authorization: Bearer $token\" https://idam.ukcloud.com/v1/users/a089698b-8f32-4a32-ab71-790b015aa662/groups/a4ebc856-222f-4686-a4bf-239c21ffa010 If you stored the user ID in a variable, you can use that in the request.

    "title": "Service Level Agreement FAQs | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Service Level Agreement FAQs General How does UKCloud determine if a service is available or not? UKCloud's approach to measuring service availability is to consider all the various elements and components (such as internal networks, the portal and the service technology stack) that can ultimately affect the availability of a service. These individual components are monitored and if one fails, the service may be deemed unavailable. We believe this approach gives a more representative and pragmatic view of service availability. More information about our services and the specific monitors for availability can be found later in this document. How does UKCloud calculate the availability of its services? UKCloud calculates availability by monitoring specific components and then using the following formula to determine the percentage that a service was available for: P = A-B x 100 A, where: P= Percentage availability A= Total number of minutes in month B = Total number of whole minutes that service is unavailable How often do you monitor your services to determine availability? UKCloud polls our services every minute using a variety of methods that range from a basic ping test to a synthetic transaction which replicates a user's journey. The method used will depend on the specific component or service being monitored. At what point is a service deemed unavailable? UKCloud deem a service to be unavailable if after five consecutive negative responses, normal service has not resumed. At this point, the downtime will start to be recorded. Are any periods of downtime excluded from the availability SLA? UKCloud excludes any time needed to complete planned or emergency maintenance from any time-based calculations related to service availability. In these events, you will be notified accordingly as described in the appropriate Service Definition. Other exceptions are outlined in UKCloud's Terms and Conditions. Are there any reasons why you wouldn't pay a Service Credit if it was due? You will not be eligible to receive a Service Credit if your account has any undisputed payments outstanding beyond their due date or you are in violation of UKCloud's Terms and Conditions including the UKCloud System Interconnect Security Policy (SISP). Can I use my own information to report downtime of a service? No, UKCloud's monitoring tools, data and records (including support tickets) will be the sole source of information used to track and validate service availability. How do I request a Service Credit? To request a Service Credit, customers must raise a support call on the UKCloud Portal within thirty (30) calendar days of the suspected SLA Event. UKCloud will review the request and issue a Service Credit if applicable either during that billing cycle or the subsequent one if the claim is made just after an invoice has been paid. Does UKCloud have an SLA that covers customer-owned hardware or appliances such as routers? If you wish to co-locate additional devices in UKCloud's data centre(s), this falls outside of UKCloud's responsibility and control, and therefore the devices will not be covered by a UKCloud SLA. If you are co-locating devices in our data centre(s), you should be aware that doing so could introduce single points of failure. Do you monitor your data centre networks and components? UKCloud monitors the data centre network between the physical hypervisor hosts or storage platform and the outside interface connecting the data centre network to any third-party networks (for example, PSN, Janet, internet, private circuits, and colocation environments). Portal How is the UKCloud portal monitored? What if I am unable to access my portal account? To confirm that the UKCloud Portal is available, UKCloud performs synthetic transactions by authenticating access to an account by a simulated user and retrieving a support ticket. This process demonstrates whether the UKCloud portal is accessible and that this element of the service is available. If you are unable to access your portal account to raise a support ticket, then you will need to call UKCloud on 01252 303300 and select option 2. Connectivity What SLA does UKCloud offer on connectivity? UKCloud does not offer any SLA covering the performance or availability of any external connection to the UKCloud platform, this includes internet, PSN or Janet, for example. Connections between services within UKCloud are covered by the SLA representing the services, including inter-DC connectivity between UKCloud's regions and sites. UKCloud for VMware How do you offer an SLA on UKCloud for VMware? UKCloud monitors three main components of the UKCloud for VMware service to provide the best overall measure of service availability. The first component is the physical host server that the VM is running on. This confirms that the VM has resources and can be available. The second component is the data store which ensures that the storage associated with the VM is accessible. The last component monitored is the UKCloud for VMware API (available on the UKCloud Portal ) which you may use to programmatically control your UKCloud for VMware environment. By monitoring these three components, UKCloud believes that we can provide the best overall view of the availability of the service. How do you monitor the availability of the physical servers? UKCloud will monitor the underlying physical servers every minute using internal systems and tools to verify that the server is responsive and available. How are the UKCloud for VMware data store(s) monitored? UKCloud monitors the UKCloud for VMware data stores every minute using internal systems and tools to verify the status of the UKCloud for VMware storage. Do you offer an SLA on the UKCloud-provided virtual firewall? Virtual firewalls are covered by the UKCloud management plane (IaaS layer or below) SLA. Customers can claim service credits for affected VMs in the event of an outage, where the fault is within UKCloud-controlled components. Further details are available in the Service Definition. Does UKCloud offer an SLA covering the performance of a VM or its storage? No, UKCloud does not offer an SLA covering the performance of the VM or its storage. However, server capacity and resources are managed by UKCloud to ensure you receive a consistent level of service. How many credits would I receive if there was an SLA Event? This would depend on how long the service was unavailable for and the Service Level selected when the VM was purchased. For example, if an SLA Event occurs and the percentage availability falls below the commitment stated in your SLA, then UKCloud will offer you a Service Credit as a percentage of the total amount billed during the month for the VM affected. Do I receive a Service Credit if the VM is turned off during an SLA Event? No, you will only receive a Service Credit if the service provided was affected. For example, the VM was powered on. Can you give me a worked example for the UKCloud for VMware SLA? Example factors Total hours in January = 744 Cost of a VM per hour = £1.00 Availability Commitment = 99.95% Service Credit Payment = 5% Service Credit Payment cap = 5% Scenario - A VM is running and available for the month of January except for a two-hour period when the service is deemed unavailable. Are Service Credits applicable? Total minutes in the month = 44,640 Total minutes service available = 44,520 The two-hour outage means Percentage Availability of service is 99.73% which is below the Availability Commitment of 99.95% - the customer is therefore eligible for a Service Credit. How much is payable? The bill for the customer at the end of the month would be £742 (before credits are applied) The Service Credit is 5% of the amount billed to that VM during the calendar month = £37.10 The amount billed to the customer is therefore £742 - £37.10 = £704.90 UKCloud for OpenStack How do you offer an SLA on UKCloud for OpenStack? UKCloud monitors three main components of the compute services within CNI to provide the best overall measure of service availability. The first component is the physical host server that instances are running on, this confirms that instances have resources and can be available. The second component is the data store which ensures that the storage associated with instances is accessible. The last component monitored is the control plane API which you may use to programmatically control your UKCloud for OpenStack environment. By monitoring these three components, UKCloud believes that we can provide the best overall view of the availability of the service. How do you monitor the availability of the physical servers? UKCloud will monitor the underlying physical servers every minute using internal systems and tools to verify that the server is responsive and available. How are the data store(s) monitored? UKCloud monitors the data stores every minute using internal systems and tools to verify the status of UKCloud for OpenStack storage services. Does UKCloud offer an SLA covering the performance of an instance or its storage? No, UKCloud does not offer an SLA covering the performance of instances or their storage. However, platform capacity and resources are managed by UKCloud to ensure you receive a consistent level of service. How many credits would I receive if there was an SLA Event? The calculation of service credits will also depend upon whether a customer has engineered their solution to utilise multiple availability zones and regions. For example, if an SLA Event occurs and the percentage availability falls below the commitment stated in your SLA, then UKCloud will offer you a Service Credit as a percentage of the total amount billed during the month for the instances affected. Do I receive a Service Credit if the instance is turned off during an SLA Event? No, you will only receive a Service Credit if the service provided was affected. For example, the instance was turned on. Can you give me a worked example for the UKCloud for OpenStack SLA? Example factors Total hours in January = 744 Cost of an instance per hour = £1.00 Availability Commitment - Data plane = 99.95% Availability Commitment -- Control plane = 99.95% Scenario A - An instance is running as part of a globally deployed solution and available for the month of January except for a two-hour period when the data plane is deemed unavailable. Are Service Credits applicable? Total minutes in the month = 44,640 Total minutes service available = 44,520 The two-hour outage means Percentage Availability of service is 99.73% which is below the Availability Commitment of 99.95% - the customer is therefore eligible for a Service Credit. How much is payable? The bill for the customer at the end of the month would be £744 (before credits are applied) The Service Credit is 10% of the amount billed to that instance during the calendar month = £74.40 The amount billed to the customer is therefore £744 - £74.40 = £669.60 Scenario B - An instance is running within a single region and available for the month of January except for a two-hour period when the data plane is deemed unavailable. Are Service Credits applicable? Total minutes in the month = 44,640 Total minutes service available = 44,520 The two-hour outage means Percentage Availability of service is 99.73% which is below the Availability Commitment of 99.95% - the customer is therefore eligible for a Service Credit. How much is payable? The bill for the customer at the end of the month would be £744 (before credits are applied) The Service Credit is 2% of the amount billed to that instance during the calendar month = £14.88 The amount billed to the customer is therefore £744 - £74.40 = £729.12 Cloud Storage Does UKCloud offer an SLA covering the durability of data stored? No. UKCloud only offers an SLA covering the availability of the service, not the durability of the data. How do you monitor the availability of Cloud Storage for the STANDARD Service Level? UKCloud performs a synthetic transaction that mimics a user authenticating and the \"posting\" of data on to the platform. An SLA Event will be deemed to have occurred and the service deemed unavailable (specifically, a failure of storage hosts and authentication sub-system) if the monitoring fails for five consecutive minutes. How do you monitor the availability of Cloud Storage for ENHANCED and ENHANCED Plus? UKCloud performs a synthetic transaction that mimics a user authenticating and the \"posting\" of data on to the platform. An SLA Event will have occurred and the service deemed unavailable (specifically, concurrent failure of storage hosts and authentication sub-system in both data centre locations) if the monitoring fails in both data centres at the same time for five consecutive minutes. Can you give me a worked example for the Cloud Storage SLA? Example factors Total hours in January = 744 Cost of 100GiB of storage per month = £1.00 per hour Availability Commitment = 99.95% Service Credit Payment = 10% Service Credit Payment cap = 10% Scenario - 100GiB of data is stored on the platform at an expected cost of £100 per month, however the UKCloud synthetic transaction monitor fails for two hours so the service is deemed unavailable. Are Service Credits applicable? Total minutes in the month = 44,640 Total minutes service available = 44,520 The two-hour outage means Percentage Availability of Service is 99.73%, which is below the Availability Commitment of 99.95% --- the customer is therefore eligible for a Service Credit. How much is payable? The bill for the customer at the end of the month would be £100 (before credits are applied) The Service Credit is 10% of the amount billed to that VM during the calendar month = £10.00 The amount billed to the Customer is therefore £100 - £10 = £90.00 UKCloud for OpenShift Does UKCloud offer an SLA covering the durability of data stored? No. UKCloud only offers an SLA covering the availability of the service, not the durability of the data. Data generated by UKCloud for OpenShift applications should be considered transient; as such any data which requires persistency and durability should be stored in an alternative storage solution such as UKCloud's Cloud Storage. How do you monitor the UKCloud for OpenShift service? UKCloud monitors the underpinning infrastructure and UKCloud for OpenShift services to ensure the highest levels of platform availability. In addition, we perform a synthetic transaction that mimics the publication \"push\" of an application which is accessible to a test consumer. An SLA Event will be deemed to have occurred and the service deemed unavailable if the monitoring fails for five consecutive minutes. Can you give me a worked example for UKCloud for OpenShift SLA? Example factors (Assured Public UKCloud for OpenShift) Total hours in January = 744 Cost of 100GiB of Application RAM per month £0.10 x 100 = £10.00 per hour £10.00 x 744 = £7,440 per month Availability Commitment = 99.50% Service Credit Payment = 3% of monthly spend Service Credit Payment cap = 3% of monthly spend Scenario - 100GiB of application RAM is consumed on the platform at an expected cost of £7,440 per month, however the UKCloud synthetic transaction monitor fails for five hours so the service is deemed unavailable. Are Service Credits applicable? Total minutes in the month = 44,640 Total minutes service available = 44,340 The five-hour outage means Percentage Availability of Service is 99.33%, which is below the Availability Commitment of 99.50% - the customer is therefore eligible for a Service Credit. How much is payable? The bill for the customer at the end of the month would be £7,440 (before credits are applied) The Service Credit is 3% of the amount billed to that UKCloud for OpenShift instance during the calendar month = £223.20 The amount billed to the Customer is therefore £7,440 - £223.20= £7,216.80 Cloud GPU What is the SLA for Cloud GPU? The SLA for Cloud GPU is 99.90%. How is the SLA measured? Unavailability applies to the inability to connect to a new GPU resource in the event of a failure of a GPU service within a single zone. Failure condition is following a hardware fault recognised at the IaaS layer or below, and within UKCloud-controlled components. How does this change the SLA of my UKCloud for VMware VMs? The SLA of 99.90% supersedes any other SLA relating to the VM that the GPU is associated with. Is maintenance included in this calculation? Emergency and planned maintenance is excluded from calculations. How do you monitor the availability of Cloud GPU? We use NVIDIA GRID to relay health information from each individual GPU to our Network Operations Centre (NOC) monitoring tools. If a GPU alert is generated that shows GPU failure we will attempt to move any workloads from that GPU onto a new GPU. If we are unable to move the VM to a new GPU, then an SLA event is triggered. Can you give me a worked example for Cloud GPU SLA? Example factors Total hours in January = 744 Cost of a GPU per hour = £1.28 Availability Commitment = 99.90% Service Credit Payment = 3% Scenario - A GPU enabled VM is running and available for the month of January except for a two-hour period when the service is deemed unavailable. Are Service Credits applicable? Total minutes in the month = 44,640 Total minutes service available = 44,520 The two-hour outage means Percentage Availability of service is 99.73% which is below the Availability Commitment of 99.90% - the customer is therefore eligible for a Service Credit. How much is payable? The bill for the customer at the end of the month would be £952.32 (before credits are applied) The Service Credit is 3% of the amount billed to that VM during the calendar month = £28.57 The amount billed to the customer is therefore £952.32 - £28.57 = £923.75 UKCloud for Oracle Software How do you offer an SLA on UKCloud for Oracle Software? UKCloud monitors two main components of the UKCloud for Oracle Software service to provide the best overall measure of service availability. The first component is the physical host server that the Oracle Virtual Machine (OVM) is running on. This confirms that the OVM has resources and can be available. The second component is the data store which ensures that the storage associated with the OVM is accessible. By monitoring these two components, UKCloud believes that we can provide the best overall view of the availability of the service. How do you monitor the availability of the physical servers? UKCloud will monitor the underlying physical servers every minute using internal systems and tools to verify that the server is responsive and available. How are the Compute data store(s) monitored? UKCloud monitors the Oracle data stores every minute using internal systems and tools to verify the status of the UKCloud for Oracle Software storage. Does UKCloud offer an SLA covering the performance of an OVM or its storage? No, UKCloud does not offer an SLA covering the performance of the OVM or its storage. However, server capacity and resources are managed by UKCloud to ensure you receive a consistent level of service. How many credits would I receive if there was an SLA Event? This would depend on how long the service was unavailable for and the Service Level selected when the OVM was purchased. For example, if an SLA Event occurs and the percentage availability falls below the commitment stated in your SLA, then UKCloud will offer you a Service Credit as a percentage of the total amount billed during the month for the OVM affected. Do I receive a Service Credit if the OVM is turned off during an SLA Event? No, you will only receive a Service Credit if the service provided was affected i.e. the OVM was turned on. Do you offer an SLA on the UKCloud-provided virtual firewall? Virtual firewalls are covered by the UKCloud management plane SLA. Customers can claim service credits for affected VMs in the event of an outage, where the fault is within UKCloud-controlled components. Further details are available in the Service Definition. Can you give me a worked example for the UKCloud for Oracle Software SLA? Example factors Total hours in January = 744 Cost of a VM per hour = £1.00 Availability Commitment = 99.95% Service Credit Payment = 10% Scenario - A VM is running and available for the month of January except for a two-hour period when the service is deemed unavailable. Are Service Credits applicable? Total minutes in the month = 44,640 Total minutes service available = 44,520 The two-hour outage means Percentage Availability of service is 99.73% which is below the Availability Commitment of 99.95% - the customer is therefore eligible for a Service Credit. How much is payable? The bill for the customer at the end of the month would be £742 (before credits are applied) The Service Credit is 10% of the amount billed to that VM during the calendar month = £74.20 The amount billed to the customer is therefore £742 - £74.20 = £667.80 Email and Collaboration as a Service How do you offer an SLA on Email and Collaboration as a Service? Unavailability applies to existing mailboxes that become unresponsive due to a fault recognised at the SaaS layer or below. That is, the fault is within UKCloud-controlled components, such as the messaging infrastructure, storage, power or internal networking (such as physical firewalls and routers). What is not included in the SLA? The following are examples of what is not covered by the SLA: Faults within your control, such as client applications and mailbox configuration Faults within external connectivity providers (for example DDoS protected internet, PSN, Janet or HSCN) and components collocated at UKCloud Can you give me a worked example for the Email and Collaboration as a Service SLA? Example factors (Email and Collaboration as a Service) Cost of 5,000 mailboxes all using 2GiB and archiving 1GiB, on Assured and using DDoS-protected internet as connectivity, per month Price per month + storage + archived + connectivity = total price per month £3.50 + (5,000 x £1.00) + (5,000 x £0.34) + £0.00 = £6,703.50 per month Availability Commitment = 99.99% Service Credit Payment = 10% of monthly spend for every 5% below SLA target Scenario - 5,000 mailboxes all using 2GiB of storage and archiving 1GiB, on Assured and using the DDoS-protected internet, at an expected cost of £6,703.50 per month. However, the UKCloud service monitoring reports unavailability for 2 days. Are Service Credits applicable? Total days in the month = 30 Total days service available = 28 The 1-day outage means Percentage Availability of Service is 93%, which is below the Availability Commitment of 99.99% - the customer is, therefore, eligible for a Service Credit. How much is payable? The bill for the customer at the end of the month would be £6,703.50 (before credits are applied) The Service Credit is 10% of the amount billed for the amount used on Email and Collaboration as a Service during the calendar month = £670.35 The amount billed to the Customer is, therefore, £6,703.50 - £670.35 = £6,033.10 Feedback If you find an issue with this article, click Improve this Doc to suggest a change.

    "title": "Protective Monitoring FAQs | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Protective Monitoring FAQs General What is protective monitoring? Protective monitoring is a term that comes from the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), CESG guidance, listed in the Good Practice Guide 13 (GPG-13). It provides a set of guidance as to what controls, and what depth of controls should be implemented to make sure that the data being stored or transported in an IT estate is protected against cyber threats. Does UKCloud utilise Protective Monitoring on their cloud platforms? Yes. As part of our security activity to maintain the security of our platforms, we adhere to protective monitoring best practice from the NCSC. What is the scope of UKCloud's Protective Monitoring? The scope of our Protective Monitoring activity covers all assets that provide our products to customers, including all hosting infrastructure, networking and management applications. In the case of our compute products (UKCloud for VMware, UKCloud for OpenStack and UKCloud for Oracle Software) we protectively monitor up to the hypervisor, the component that provides the virtual machines. Components above this infrastructure (for example, your own virtual machines, appliances and applications), are your own responsibility to provide an appropriate protective monitoring capability. The following demonstrates the scope of UKCloud's Protective Monitoring; External connectivity, for example, internet, PSN, HSCN, Janet, RLI, leased lines - responsibility of the Telecommunications provider. Perimeter Routes/Firewalls - UKCloud protectively monitors and regularly assesses any potential vulnerabilities at the perimeter, alongside other mitigations including DDoS^ and active vulnerability scanning. Customer VDC, vApps, VMs, Virtual Network Appliance and Customer Networks - This is your responsibility to monitor. Compute Hypervisor, UKCloud Networks and Physical Infrastructure - UKCloud protectively monitor and regularly assess vulnerabilities across all components of the hosting estate (for example, hypervisors, hosting infrastructure, servers, networking and management applications). ^ For more information about UKCloud's Volumetric DDoS Protection, please read our DDoS mitigation service FAQs . Is Protective Monitoring implemented on both the Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL platforms? Yes. We protect both Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL platforms with resilient, 24/7 enhanced protective monitoring, vulnerability scanning and assessment. Am I able to get a feed from the UKCloud Protective Monitoring system? No. We do not share a feed from our platform protective monitoring to customers. You can however get access to log data for all traffic traversing your virtual boundary firewall. Can I connect my Security Operations Centre (SOC) to your protective monitoring data? No. As we do not share a feed from our platform to customers, you are not able to connect your SOC to the Protective Monitoring data. You can however get access to log data for all traffic traversing your virtual boundary firewall. Are there any enhancements or changes planned to be introduced to UKCloud's Protective Monitoring? Yes. We have an active project working to expose some threat and intelligence information to customers both through the UKCloud customer portal and its associated API. This data will initially be focussed on general intelligence information about activity in the wild (for example, a new vulnerability) and subsequently where we have been able to specifically attribute information to an individual customer.

    "keywords": "Jumpstart FAQs General What is Jumpstart? Jumpstart is a service providing skilled engineers and architects, on an hourly or daily basis, who can help design and build UKCloud solutions for you. How is Jumpstart different from UKCloud’s standard support services? UKCloud’s standard support services are limited to ensuring the availability and performance of services such as UKCloud for VMware or UKCloud for OpenStack. For example, UKCloud engineers will not usually log in to a customer environment or configure services at the operating system level. In addition, UKCloud’s pre-sales resources, such as Cloud Architects, provide high-level design services only. Jumpstart provides you with dedicated resources to undertake low-level design work and is a hands-on implementation activity. What kind of things can Jumpstart help me with? Jumpstart is a flexible service that you can use for a wide range of projects. Some examples of recent projects where Jumpstart has helped include: Configuring IPSec connectivity to UKCloud Building a highly available SQL cluster Creating an Active Directory domain Building Terraform / Ansible templates for OpenStack Setting up global load balancing services Preparing applications for deployment to OpenShift Who will deliver the Jumpstart service? UKCloud have a team of consultants, with skill sets aligned to the services offered, which forms the Jumpstart service.

Jumpstart is designed to provide additional skills and resources during the build phase of a project. Note that Jumpstart does not provide an ongoing support service. You should either have, or plan to have, the relevant skills to support the service following the conclusion of the Jumpstart activity. How can I order Jumpstart? For existing customers, you can raise a ticket in the UKCloud Portal requesting access to Jumpstart services. If you are not already a UKCloud customer, you should first discuss Jumpstart with an Account Director or Cloud Architect. What do I need to do before my project can start? It's important that any prerequisites such as cloud environment deployment, connectivity and assurance activities are completed prior to a Jumpstart engineer commencing work. Your Jumpstart engineer will discuss these prerequisites during the initial kick-off call or meeting. We will create a pre-flight checklist to track progress against these activities. How do I know what my Jumpstart engineer is working on? Prior to commencing a Jumpstart engagement, the engineer will estimate the tasks involved and the time it may take to complete them. Once the engagement commences, the engineer will record actual time used against these estimates. Your Jumpstart consultant will happily share this information with you at any time during the engagement to keep you informed. How much does the Jumpstart service cost? Both the consultancy and engineering time for the Jumpstart service is sold in packs of four days at a price of £3500. This equates to 32 hours of Jumpstart time. When will I be billed? You will be billed for Jumpstart hours consumed during the month at the end of each month. What happens if I don’t use up all of the time I purchased? It is common to have some time remaining at the end of a Jumpstart engagement. You can use this time on-demand for up to one year following the initial Jumpstart order. Common uses for this time include help, advice and modifications. Note though that there is no SLA associated with Jumpstart and it is not designed to be used as a support service. How can I re-engage a jumpstart consultant after a period of inactivity? During the initial period of a Jumpstart engagement the project is considered to be active. During an active Jumpstart, your project will be scheduled as part of an engineer’s workload and they will be available to spend time on your project at short notice. Once a Jumpstart project enters an inactive state you'll then need to raise a ticket in the Portal to re-engage an engineer. Quick activities (typically one hour or less) will usually be dealt with quickly while longer activities will need scheduling into an engineer’s workload.

    "title": "Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for OpenStack | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for OpenStack Overview This Getting Started Guide covers basic topics like where to find your instances (virtual machines, or VMs, in VMware terminology), as well as more in-depth topics such as instance storage choice (ephemeral or volume storage) and its implications. Intended audience This guide is intended for users who want to learn more about UKCloud for OpenStack. Logging in to the OpenStack Horizon dashboard To manage your OpenStack projects, you can log in to the OpenStack Horizon dashboard via our Single Sign-On (SSO) service, using your UKCloud Portal credentials. Additionally, if you've set up two-factor authentication (2FA) in the Portal, when logging in using your Portal credentials, you'll be prompted for a 2FA code. Go to the URL provided in your welcome email, for example, https://cor00005.cni.ukcloud.com/ . From the Authenticate using list, select: Keystone Credentials if your account has not been migrated to SSO UKCloud SSO if your account has been migrated to SSO If you selected Keystone Credentials , enter your UKCloud Portal login credentials and click Connect . If you selected UKCloud SSO click Connect . You'll be redirected to the SSO login page, where you can enter your username and password and click Log in . If you've set up two-factor authentication (2FA) in the Portal, you'll be prompted for a 2FA code. After logging in, the first screen you'll see is the Overview page. From here you can get a summary of your project and view your resource usage and the quotas configured on the project. For more information about the Horizon dashboard, see the Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10 Introduction to the OpenStack Dashboard . Creating your network infrastructure Before you can begin creating instances, you must first build the required network components. In a freshly provisioned project, the only resource that will exist initially is a shared external network called internet . You need to create the following minimum set of resources: A router using the internet external network A network and associated subnet, specifying the network address using CIDR notation (for example, 192.168.1.0/24), and DHCP settings for DNS, any static routes, and so on. A router interface to connect the router to your new subnet When you have created these elements, you can view them in the Network Topology page in the Horizon dashboard. You can create your network infrastructure in one of the following ways: Using Horizon to manually create your infrastructure (see Using Horizon to manually create your infrastructure ) Using the OpenStack Heat orchestration tool to create stacks (see Using the OpenStack Heat orchestration tool to create stacks ) Using the OpenStack API and automation (see Using the OpenStack API and automation ) Using the OpenStack CLI clients (see Command-line clients for UKCloud for OpenStack ) Using Horizon to manually create your infrastructure The Network Topology page is a useful page to get started with. This page provides a resizable, moveable and interactive view of your OpenStack project, along with easily accessible buttons for manually creating routers and networks and for launching instances. To create your network infrastructure: In the Horizon dashboard, expand the Network menu on the left side of the screen and select Network Topology . On the Network Topology page, click the Create Router button. In the Create Router dialog box, enter a Router Name . From the Admin State list, ensure that UP is selected so that the router is online at the point of creation. From the External Network list, select the external network to which you want to attach your router. Click Create Router . Back on the Network Topology page, click the Create Network button. On the Network page of the Create Network wizard, enter a Network Name and click Next . On the Subnet page, enter a Subnet Name . In the Network Address field, allocate your network a suitable address space. In the Gateway IP field, enter an IP address from the address space for the router you created earlier to use to access the network. Click Next . On the Subnet Details page, the only field you'll probably want to change is DNS Name Servers . UKCloud does not provide DNS as a service, so to start with you could make use of Google's public 8.8.8.8 service. You can update this field later if you intend to run your own DNS caching service. If you leave the Allocation Pools field blank, then by default the whole address space is used for the pool. Click Create . To add the router interface to link your new network to the router, on the Network Topology page, select the router and click the Add Interface button. In the Add Interface dialog box, from the Subnet list, select your subnet and then click Add Interface . Understanding access and security Security groups In OpenStack, rather than deploying a perimeter firewall to protect your network from the outside world, every instance is protected by its own firewall. This instance firewall is applied at the network level, independent of any additional firewall the guest operating system may be using. The instance firewall is controlled by applying one or more security groups to the instance, either at instance creation or real-time at any point during the lifecycle of the instance. Where multiple security groups are specified, all the firewall rules in those security groups are applied. A security group consists of one or more rules. Each rule is composed of five elements: Role --- Custom or predefined protocol type (for example, TCP, UDP or ICMP) Direction --- Ingress or Egress Open Port or Port Range --- Open either a single port or a range of ports Remote --- The source of the traffic to be allowed via this rule (source address for an inbound rule, or destination address for an outbound rule) The ether type (that is IPv4 or IPv6) --- Not currently available When adding a new rule to a security group, you can choose from a pre-populated list of common rules, for example, SSH, DNS, HTTP or SMTP, or you can specify your own custom rule. SSH key pairs Another change if you're used to using vCloud Director, is the authenticated access to your instances. OpenStack, like most other cloud providers, doesn't use templates that allow password controlled access. The standard cloud method of authenticating access to a new instance is to use SSH key pair authentication --- your SSH client uses the private key and OpenStack injects the public key into your new instance using the cloud-init package pre-installed in the instance image. Before you launch any instances on OpenStack, you need to set up at least one SSH key pair. You can use OpenStack to create a new key pair for you, or if you have an existing SSH key pair, you can import the public key so that OpenStack can use it to inject into new instances. To see what public keys have already been set up for your use: In the Horizon dashboard, expand the Compute menu on the left side of the screen and select Access & Security . Select the Key Pairs tab. If you want OpenStack to create a key pair for you: Click the Create Key Pair button. In the Create Key Pair dialog box, enter a Key Pair Name and then click Create Key Pair . OpenStack creates the key pair and downloads it in your web browser. Save the file somewhere safe as you will need it when connecting your SSH client to your instances. To import an existing public key: On the Key Pairs tab of the Access & Security page, click the Import Key Pair button. In the Import Key Pair dialog box, enter a Key Pair Name and paste the contents of your existing public key file into the Public Key field. Click Import Key Pair . Note for Windows users If you're using a Windows desktop environment, the chances are that you're using the PuTTY program for your SSH client. The PuTTY SSH client doesn't use OpenSSH format files for the key pair files. It does however provide a PuTTYgen program that can import and export in the correct format as outlined below. If you want OpenStack to create your key pair: Open PuTTYgen. From the Conversions menu select Import key . Select the downloaded private key file generated by OpenStack. Click the Save private key button to save the imported key as a ppk file that PuTTY can use for authentication. If you want to import an existing key: Open PuTTYgen. Click the Generate button. Copy the public key from the top of the dialog box. Paste the public key into the Public Key field in Horizon's Import Key Pair dialog box. Launching your instances Now that you've considered security, created a network and a subnet, and you've connected them to your external network with a router, you can start to think about launching some instances attached to the network. There are a few choices you need to make when launching your instances. The following sections outline how to achieve this task via the Horizon dashboard, however you can also use the OpenStack CLI, HEAT templates or the OpenStack API. Choosing your image When you create an instance in OpenStack, its disk is cloned from an image managed by OpenStack. The image may be a custom image that has been developed for a specific purpose and uploaded to your project. It may also be a custom image that has been specifically shared between two projects. More likely, you'll start by using one of the public images that we provide and manage on our platform. You can see the images that are available for you to use by expanding the Compute menu on the left side of the Horizon dashboard and clicking Images . Choosing your instance size If you're already familiar with UKCloud's vCloud Director-based UKCloud for VMWare service, then you may be used to being able to choose exactly how many vCPUs and how much memory a VM is allocated. In OpenStack, you choices are restricted to a number of pre-defined flavors that define how many vCPUs, how much memory and how much storage an instance may use. Although full details for each flavor are available through the Horizon UI, there's no overall list available showing all the different flavors and sizes of instances. However, if you've installed the OpenStack CLI tools (see http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/common/cli-install-openstack-command-line-clients.html ), you can run the following command to retrieve a list of the flavors and their makeup \\> openstack flavor list Choosing your storage type There are two storage options available for use with your instances: Ephemeral storage (default) Persistent volume storage Ephemeral storage When you create an instance, the default behaviour is to clone your chosen disk image onto the physical disk attached to the host that will be running the instance. This is not dedicated locally attached storage to your instance, but rather a RAID array of fast SSD disks that is shared by all the instances running on the host hypervisor. The performance of the ephemeral storage makes for very fast disk access. However, as the disk image is stored locally on the host hypervisor, you're at risk of data loss in the event of hardware failure on the host. For scheduled maintenance on the host, you can live‑migrate instances onto other hosts with minimal interruption. If the host were to suffer a hardware failure, it's likely that you'd lose the data stored on the disk image, so you should architect your application to expect and be able to recover from failure. Persistent volume storage As an alternative to ephemeral storage you can clone your chosen disk image to an OpenStack volume , which is a persistent storage option backed by a Ceph storage array. The volume is then network mounted onto the host hypervisor and the instance booted from the network attached storage. For scheduled maintenance on the host, these instances are more easily managed onto other hosts. In the event of a hardware failure on the host, the volume can just be mounted to another host and the instance restarted without any data loss. For more information about volumes, see Working with volumes . Creating an instance You can create a new instance in the Horizon UI. Click or select Launch Instance on one of the following pages: Images page (under the Compute menu) Instances page (under the Compute menu) Network Topology page (under the Networks menu) On the Details tab of the Launch Instance dialog box, enter an Instance Name and select a Flavor . As you select a flavor from the list, the dialog box updates to reflect the VCPUs , Disk and RAM that the selected flavour gives you and the green bars under Project Limits update to show what your usage would be after launching the instance. If you select a flavour that would take you over your project's quota, the bar is red rather than green. From the Instance Boot Source list, select: Boot from image to create an instance that boots from the local ephemeral storage. Boot from image (creates a new volume) to create an instance that boots from a volume From the Image Name list, select your preferred image. If you're creating an image that boots from a volume, you can choose what size to create the boot disk without being restricted to the disk allocation specified by the selected flavour. On the Access & Security tab, from the Key Pair list, select the SSH key pair you want to inject into your new instance. If there is only one SSH key pair configured in your project, it will be automatically selected. Select one or more Security Groups to apply to the instance. On the Networking tab, from the Available networks list, select the network that you want to create the new instance on. If your project has only a single network defined, that network will already be listed under Selected networks . Click Launch and OpenStack reports that your new instance is launching. Accessing your instance Having successfully launched your new instance, you'll want to log in and start installing your applications. To access your new instance from the outside world, you have to associate a floating IP address to the instance. A floating IP address is a public routable address that is allocated to your project. Having allocated an address to your project, you can then choose to associate it to a particular instance. When you've done this, a DNAT rule is automatically created on the router you created earlier to forward all incoming traffic to your chosen instance. To associate a floating IP address to your new instance: On the Instances page, from the Actions list for your instance, select Associate Floating IP . In the Manage Floating IP Associations dialog box, from the IP Address list, select the floating IP address that you want to allocate to the instance. If you don't have any spare floating IP addresses allocated to your project, you can click the + button next to the IP Address list to allocate a new address. In the Allocate Floating IP dialog box, from the Pool list, select the pool from which to allocate the floating IP address. Currently the only option is internet , but the list will expand as additional networks come online. Click Allocate IP to allocate the new floating IP address to your project. Back in the Manage Floating IP Associations dialog box, associate the new address with your instance. Click Allocate IP . You can use your SSH client to connect to the floating IP address, authenticating the connection with the private key that matches the key pair you selected when you launched the instance. You can find more information about using and controlling instances and images on OpenStack in the Red Hat documentation at https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/8/instances-and-images-guide/instances-and-images-guide . Working with volumes Creating a volume Volumes are block devices that you can attach to instances. Because volumes are replicated across OpenStack's storage array, effectively providing three copies of data from a resilience perspective, they provide the basis of our persistent storage offering. In the Horizon dashboard, expand the Compute menu on the left side of the screen and select Volumes . On the Volumes page, click the Create Volume button. In the Create Volume dialog box, enter a Volume Name and Description . From the Volume Source list, select: No source, empty volume to create a totally empty volume for customer to populate with their data (this is the default option) Image to enable customer to create a prepopulated volume from a previously created image From the Volume Type list, select: Tier 1 for our most performant block storage for workloads requiring consistently higher disk throughput Tier 2 for block storage with typical performance characteristics for use by production applications or storage (this is the default option) From the Size list, select the size of your volume in GiB. From the Availability Zone list, select the availability zone to which you want to target your volume. Create Create Volume . Retyping a volume You can retype a volume to take an existing volume of a particular volume type and converting it to another (that is, from Tier 1 to Tier 2 or vice versa). Retyping a volume attached to an instance Due to a dependency on the underlying hypervisor, it is not currently possible to retype a volume that is attached to an instance. If you want to retype a volume that is attached to an instance, you must first detach the volume from the instance. To detach the volume from the instance, in the Horizon dashboard, expand the Compute menu on the left side of the screen and select Volumes . On the Volumes page, for the volume that you want to detach, from the list on the far right of the page, select Manage Attachments . In the Manage Volume Attachments dialog box, click the Detach Volume button. Retype the volume by following the steps in Retyping an independent volume . On the Volumes page, for the volume that you want to reattach, from the list on the far right, select Manage Attachments . In the Manage Volume Attachments dialog box, from the Attach to Instance list, select the instance to which you want to reattach the volume and click the Attach Volume button. Note If you attempt to retype a volume that is still attached to an instance, the process will attempt to run but will fail without notification. Retyping an independent volume If the volume that you want to retype is not attached to an instance, you can retype it. Ensure that the volume is detached from any instances. For information about how to detach an volume from an instance, see Retyping a volume attached to an instance . In the Horizon dashboard, expand the Compute menu on the left side of the screen and select Volumes . On the Volumes page, for the volume that you want to retype, from the list on the far right of the page, select Change Volume Type . In the Change Volume Type dialog box, from the Type drop down list, select the new type for the volume. From the Migration Policy list, ensure that you select On Demand . Note If any other option is selected, the retyping process will not work. Click Change Volume Type . Note You may notice duplicate volumes while the retyping process is running. These duplicate volumes will disappear when the process has completed. Important Do not attach a retyped volume to an instance until the retyping process has completed successfully. Retyping an independent volume using the OpenStack CLI To retype a volume using the OpenStack CLI, use the following command: \\> cinder retype *volume* *volume-type* Where: volume is the name or ID of the volume that you want to retype volume-type is the new volume type Working with the API and automation Using the OpenStack Heat orchestration tool to create stacks OpenStack provides an orchestration tool out of the box. The Heat tool enables you to describe your infrastructure as a text file, referred to as a Heat template , defining one or more resources using a YAML format. Having defined your resources in your Heat template, you then use the template to create a stack . The stack contains the instantiation of the resources defined in the YAML file, along with a history of events and operations that have happened to the resources in the stack. For an example of what a basic Heat template looks like, take a look at https://github.com/UKCloud/automation_examples/blob/master/heat/example.yaml The example.yaml template creates the same router, network, subnet and router interface that you created manually above. In addition, the template defines an SSH key pair, security groups and launch instances. We'll look at these other resource elements in more detail later. To use a template to create a stack in your project: In the Horizon dashboard, expand the Orchestration menu on the left side of the screen and select Stacks . On the Stacks page, click the Launch Stack button. On the Select Template page, from the Template Source list, select URL . In the Template URL field, enter the URL of the Raw version of the template that you want to use (for example, the example.yaml template). Click Next . On the Launch Stack page, enter a Stack Name and select the flavour and image as required. Click Launch to start creating the stack resources in the background. You can go back to the Stacks page to view progress, drill down into the resources defined in the stack and see the events as they happen. You can also use an updated Heat template to apply an update to resources in a stack. You can also destroy an entire stack, cleaning up all the resources that you previously created. This makes Heat a very powerful tool for creating short‑lived test and preproduction environments on‑demand that may form part of a continuous delivery pipeline. Using the OpenStack API and automation OpenStack also provides a fully functional API to enable programmatic control over your project. The Horizon UI you used earlier is itself a client that makes calls to this underlying API. Although you can write your own code to interact with the API, there are a number of different libraries already available covering most popular programming languages. Alternatively, there is also a growing number of DevOps automation tools available (for example, Terraform and Ansible) that interact with the OpenStack API to orchestrate the creation and ongoing management of your infrastructure. For an example Terraform configuration to create a similar network infrastructure to the one you created in the previous examples, take a look at https://github.com/UKCloud/automation_examples/tree/master/terraform-os . Whatever library or automation tools you choose to use, you'll need to know a few important details to make a connection to and authenticate against the API. In the Horizon dashboard, expand the Compute menu on the left side of the screen and select Access & Security . On the Access and Security page, select the API Access tab. On the API Access tab, you can see all the relevant API endpoints for making connections to the various OpenStack subsystems, including the Identify endpoint, which provides the initial authentication process that you'll typically need when configuring connections. You can also download your user's OpenStack RC file for use in the following section. Note If your account is SSO-enabled, download the v3 RC file. If your account is enabled for SSO, you'll need to add the following items to the RC file you downloaded in the previous step. export OS_AUTH_TYPE=\"v3oidcpassword\" export OS_IDENTITY_PROVIDER=\"sso\" export OS_PROTOCOL=\"oidc\" export OS_CLIENT_ID=\"\" export OS_CLIENT_SECRET=\"\" export OS_DISCOVERY_ENDPOINT=\"https://idp.ukcloud.com/auth/realms/client-assured/.well-known/openid-configuration The client_id for Corsham is cni.1.cor00005 The client_id for Farnborough is cni.1.frn00006 You can set the client_secret to any value Using the OpenStack command-line client The OpenStack project provides a command‑line client that enables you to access the project API through easy‑to‑use commands. For example, the compute service provides a NOVA command‑line client. You can run the commands from the command line, or include the commands in scripts to automate tasks. If you provide OpenStack credentials, such as your user name and password, you can run these commands on any computer. The following file is a bash shell script format file that sets up all the relevant environment variables in the Linux shell session so that you can use the OpenStack CLI tools. The OpenStack CLI tools, just like the Horizon UI, also communicate with the OpenStack API. This means you can examine the contents of the RC file to find the settings that you may need to pass into, for example, a Terraform provider definition when configuring it to manage your OpenStack project. The key values to note here are the OS\\_AUTH\\_URL , OS\\_TENANT\\_NAME and OS\\_USERNAME environment variables, as these will be common to any API authentication request. In addition, creating the line export OS\\_INTERFACE=public in the RC file should address any issues you may have accessing the Admin API endpoints. Next steps In this Getting Started Guide, you've learned how to use the OpenStack Horizon UI to set up UKCloud for OpenStack and create new instances. You've also learned about the other tools available including the OpenStack API and command-line client. You can find additional information in the following places: OpenStack API --- For more information about using the API, see the OpenStack documentation at http://developer.openstack.org/api-guide/quick-start/ OpenStack Client --- For more information about using the OpenStack Client, see the OpenStack documentation at http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/cli.html HEAT templates --- You can find more information about the Heat orchestration tool and the resources you can use in the YAML format templates in the OpenStack documentation at https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Heat and http://docs.openstack.org/developer/heat/template_guide/index.html Terraform --- For information about using Terraform and the OpenStack provider, see the Terraform documentation at https://www.terraform.io/intro/ and https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/openstack/index.html Ansible --- For information on Ansible's support for working with OpenStack resources, see the Ansible documentation at http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/list_of_cloud_modules.html#openstack Related videos OpenStack Horizon dashboard overview video Glossary This section provides a glossary of terms specific to UKCloud for OpenStack.

UKCloud provides this service across two security domains, Assured OFFICIAL (formerly PGA IL2) and Elevated OFFICIAL (formerly PGA IL3), offering up to 99.95% availability. This choice allows customers to precisely match application and user needs to an appropriate security domain and cost, instead of designing to the highest level which may not always be needed. What hypervisor do you use? UKCloud for OpenStack is built using KVM hypervisor technology, a trusted solution for implementing virtualised environments. Does UKCloud offer dedicated, bare-metal host capabilities (OpenStack Ironic) with UKCloud for OpenStack? UKCloud currently does not offer dedicated, bare metal host capabilities with its UKCloud for OpenStack product. We do however provide \"large\" instances, with up to 56 vCpus and 440Gb Ram, with no overcommit. UKCloud also offers its 'Private Cloud for Compute' product which provides dedicated compute capabilities for use with OpenStack; please visit the Digital Marketplace or contact your Account Director for further details. Which Disk formats does UKCloud for OpenStack support? The disk format of a virtual machine image is the format of the underlying disk image. Virtual appliance vendors have different formats for laying out the information contained in a virtual machine disk image. Set the disk format for your image to one of the following values: aki - An Amazon kernel image ami - An Amazon machine image ari - An Amazon ramdisk image iso - An archive format for the data contents of an optical disc, such as CD-ROM qcow2 - Supported by the QEMU emulator that can expand dynamically and supports Copy on Write raw - An unstructured disk image format; if you have a file without an extension it is possibly a raw format vdi - Supported by VirtualBox virtual machine monitor and the QEMU emulator vhd - The VHD disk format, a common disk format used by virtual machine monitors from VMware, Xen, Microsoft, VirtualBox, and others vmdk - Common disk format supported by many common virtual machine monitors Instances (VMs) Can instances have different service levels? UKCloud for OpenStack is a cloud platform built specifically for cloud native applications which have been engineered to use stateless, disposable instances. Due to the disposable design constructs of customer solutions, only a single service level is required Are instances contended? Instances are contended using the default OpenStack ratios against the following resources: CPU - 16:1 Memory - 1.1:1 Do I get root access to the instances I deploy? Yes, as this is a true IaaS cloud service, you have complete control and autonomy over each instance you deploy, and so have full 'root' or administrative access. What Instance sizes are available? UKCloud offers a variety of predefined flavours to meet customers' needs. The smallest configuration is 512MiB memory and 1 vCPU. The largest is 440GiB memory with 56 vCPU. Check the service definition for more details on the currently available sizes. Does UKCloud for OpenStack offer GPU optimised instances? Currently UKCloud does not offer GPU optimised OpenStack instances. Can I resize an instance? Yes, you can change instance size (processor, memory and storage allocations) to a different predefined size via the self-service Portal and API. Increasing instance size may result in the instance being billed at a higher rate. Additional volume storage can be allocated instantly and will be billed on a per GiB basis. What is the speed of each vCPU? This is set at 2.4 GHz across instances. Does UKCloud offer encryption on instances? Not by default but, if it's required, you can implement it using a technology of your choice inside the instance OS. Is UKCloud's encryption service available for UKCloud for OpenStack? Not currently, but we are considering options based upon customer feedback. Networking How many IP addresses do I get? You're initially allocated three external IP addresses with each OpenStack project. You can ask for more external IP addresses via a Service Request in the UKCloud Portal. How many network routers do I get? You're initially able to create up to two network routers in each OpenStack project. You can ask the router quota to be increased via a Service Request in the UKCloud Portal. How many PSN IP addresses do I get? Customer organisations are initially allocated one external PSN IP address. Additional external PSN IP addresses can be requested via a Service Request should a valid business requirement arise. What firewall services are available? UKCloud controls and manages a perimeter firewall on the edge of our Assured cloud platform which securely segregates traffic. OpenStack includes the concept of \"Security Groups\" which can be used to implement firewall filtering on the virtual NIC level. You can also use your preferred software firewall and security appliances deployed within your project. Which firewall ports do you suggest to open? To access the infrastructure via the dashboard and API you will need access through any firewalls on the following ports to the OpenStack endpoints you target. 443, 13000, 13080, 13004, 13776, 13774, 13777, 13696, 13776 How does UKCloud provide urgent maintenance notifications and incident reports? Current Service Status reports are published on the Status Page . You can view past incident reports on the UKCloud Portal. Do you offer dynamic or static IP addresses? The external IP addresses are allocated to the project from a pool and will remain allocated to that project unless you explicitly select to \"release\" the address. Internal IPs are assigned to instances from a pool and will remain assigned to that instance/network port until that instance or network port is deleted. Optionally, it is possible to select the IP address assigned during instance/port creation. Are external Domain Name System (DNS) services available? No, we don't currently offer this service. You can implement your own DNS servers within your solution, or configure your instances to connect to an externally hosted DNS server - for example, one hosted on a government secure network such as PSN or HSCN; or one available on the Internet such as Google 8.8.8.8. Are domain name registration services available? No, we don't currently offer this service. Some government secure networks (such as PSN and HSCN) offer domain name registration and DNS hosting as part of their service. For internet-facing services a third-party domain provider will be required. Is Network Time Protocol available for time synchronisation? Network Time Protocol services will initially only be available via public NTP servers. Can UKCloud provide SSL certificates or can existing SSL certificates be used? UKCloud doesn't provide SSL certificates, but you can use your existing ones. Some government secure networks (such as PSN and HSCN) provide SSL certificates as part of their service. Do you offer load balancing? Due to OpenStack Neutron not supporting highly-available load balancing services, UKCloud has created How to creating load balancing services on UKCloud for OpenStack , which describes how to deploy a HA load balancing solution, of which the first deployed solution is free of charge. We will look to include more native OpenStack functionality once a highly-available solution is provided by the community. Can I deploy my own load balancer? Yes, you can deploy your own load balancing virtual appliance provided it is compatible with KVM hypervisor and OpenStack. Do you have an IPSEC VPN connection for uploading sensitive data? We currently do not offer any VPN/Tunnelling as a Service from within the UKCloud for OpenStack product. Customers can create their own VPN endpoints by deploying a software appliance such as pfSense on an instance within their project. Storage How much storage do I get with an instance? The default amount of storage which comes with each instance starts from 10GiB of ephemeral storage and increases as larger instances are consumed. Full details can be found in the UKCloud for OpenStack Service Definition ( Assured | Elevated ). All ephemeral storage is fixed and cannot be increased. How do I scale beyond the default allocation of ephemeral storage? UKCloud for OpenStack is available with persistent block storage options. Persistent block storage is resilient, distributed block storage that can be moved between instances and retain data in the event of an instance becoming destroyed or unavailable. You can quickly and easily allocate additional persistent block storage volumes via the self-service dashboard or API, which will be charged on a per-GiB basis. Can I reallocate storage across instances? Persistent block storage volumes can be detached from one instance then attached to another (except those being used as OS boot volumes). It is not possible for a volume to be attached to multiple instances simulutaneously. You can allocate additional persistent block storage via the self-service dashboard or API, which will be charged on a per-GiB basis. Is instance storage persistent? No, the ephemeral storage provided with each instance is non-persistent and any data stored on it will be deleted at the point an instance is terminated. Persistent block storage volumes are persistent. If required, it is possible to deploy an instance using a block storage volume as its boot volume. Is Object Storage (OpenStack Swift) available? Unfortunately, the OpenStack Object Storage service (Swift) is not currently available on UKCloud for OpenStack. However, UKCloud offers Cloud Storage, a separate S3-compatible Object Storage service which can be used in conjunction with OpenStack; please visit the Digital Market place or contact your Account Director for further details. What is the fastest way of importing large amounts of data onto the UKCloud platform? The speed of data transfer to the UKCloud platform isn't guaranteed. However, during tests of the upload and download speeds, an average of 8 Mbit/s was achieved for image import/export and 40 Mbit/s for data transferred over FTPS. For a transfer time calculator, click here . If you use FTPS to upload data to or download it from your environment, you can transfer up to 1TiB of data in a day. Management How do I access my solutions via the internet? You can access your instances using: The remote console via the OpenStack dashboard Remote access protocols (such as RDP/SSH) over a VPN or secure network How do I access my solutions via government networks (PSN, HSCN)? Although UKCloud allows you to make your customer-facing applications accessible via government network connections, the management of your Assured OFFICIAL OpenStack environment can only be achieved directly via an internet connection. OpenStack environments in our Elevated OFFICIAL security domain can be managed via the PSN network. What reports can I get about instances performance? UKCloud does not currently provide instance performance reports, but you can monitor their performance using standard tools within the operating system. Does UKCloud patch instances? No, you are responsible for the patching of your services. We make a patch repository available to you for instances on the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform (which cannot connect to the internet) for common operating systems that we provide. <!--### How do I find the latest patches to the UKCloud infrastructure? UKCloud maintains a Knowledge Centre article advising the current patch level of the UKCloud infrastructure. See [here](../other/other-ref-platform-patches.md). --> How do I access support and patches for operating systems that UKCloud licenses? UKCloud provides a repository of patches for common operating systems for customers to access and update from. Please refer to the onboarding guide or the Knowledge Centre for details. For support, you'll need to log a request with UKCloud, who will log the ticket with the relevant supplier. UKCloud will then inform you about any updates. However, UKCloud isn't responsible for the actual resolution of non-IaaS issues. Do you have a Key Management System (KMS) for activating Windows? Yes. A we provide a step-by-step guide on configuring and using this service. How do I control an instance? You control an instance via the OpenStack dashboard or API. Controls include stop, start, restart, load media, clone, snapshot, and so on. Do you monitor instances? UKCloud monitors the underlying platform but doesn't monitor your OSs or applications. You can implement your own application performance monitoring solutions within your projects. Do you offer autoscaling? OpenStack offers built in autoscaling capabilities using the features of HEAT templates and Ceilometer event monitoring. Blueprints are available on the UKCloud web site to assist with creating autoscaling policies. How quickly can I scale my service up or down? Horizontal scale can be achieved quickly by adding additional instances (usually in seconds). Vertical scaling is not recommended for cloud native applications, but can be achieved by resizing an instance to an alternative flavour type (where supported by the guest OS). Licensing, software and anti-virus What operating systems are available? UKCloud for OpenStack is powered by OpenStack, so is compatible with a wide range of x86/x64 operating systems. You can use the UKCloud catalogue of operating systems or upload your own: For Linux we offer; Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, Ubuntu 14.04 to 16.04 and CentOS 6.0 to 7.2. Windows 2012 R2 & Windows 2016 are fully supported Can I run Microsoft SQL on my instances? Microsoft SQL can be installed within an OpenStack instance. You have the choice to either bring your own license using the Microsoft License Mobility scheme or choose to use a UKCloud provided license. The process for both options are available on the UKCloud Knowledge Centre here . How can I license an operating system? Microsoft Microsoft terms and conditions preclude customers from using their own licence agreements for Windows Server in the Cloud. That means all licensing for Windows Server operating systems must be provided by UKCloud. Microsoft offers License Mobility, a scheme that allows a customer to provide additional software such as Exchange, SQL and so on, as long as the customer has appropriate Microsoft licensing as per the licence terms, conditions and usage rights. RHEL RHEL operating systems can be licensed by the customer directly with Red Hat. We are Currently unable to provide RHEL licences for UKCloud for OpenStack. The customer is responsible for ensuring correct licensing for any other operating system they chose to install. How up to date are the operating system images and mirrors? All CentOS, Ubuntu, Red Hat and Debian distributions are automatically updated to contain the latest patches and releases. For a list of supported operating systems, and instructions on how to access these repositories, see the appropriate article in the Knowledge Centre. What anti-virus do you offer on this service? Customers are advised to install their own anti-virus (AV) software, as UKCloud doesn't provide any. What applications are available as part of the default service? UKCloud does not offer any additional software other than what's included in the UKCloud Portal catalogue. Any additional software, including its licensing, is your responsibility. What is Bring Your Own (BYO) licensing for Red Hat? BYO licensing for Red Hat allows customers to select instances running on the UKCloud Assured cloud platform for covering by their own commercial agreement with Red Hat. UKCloud will remove the cost of the Red Hat licence from your monthly bill for the selected instances. You need to raise a Service Request to let us know which instances you will cover with your own Red Hat licence. Support How do I raise a support ticket? The secure online UKCloud Portal provides most common service management functionality. You can raise tickets within the My Calls section of the Portal. Alternatively, you can contact support by phone or email. How do I manage my services? Services on the Assured OFFICIAL platform can be managed over the internet (or other connectivity) via the UKCloud Portal. For the Elevated OFFICIAL platform, security requirements are stricter and require either a PSN-approved connection, UKCloud Secure Remote Access or a self-managed CPA-approved VPN solution (for example site-to-site VPN). What are your service maintenance windows? As far as possible, planned maintenance of UKCloud's infrastructure takes place periodically and at a time which aims to minimise customer impact. We provide customers with at least 14 days' advance notice of planned maintenance. As far as possible, emergency maintenance of UKCloud's infrastructure takes place between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Friday, or between the hours of 08:00 and 12:00 (UK local time) on Saturday or Sunday, unless there is an identified and demonstrable immediate risk to a customer's environment. Whenever possible, we provide customers with at least six hours' advance notice of emergency maintenance. Can I configure email alerts from the Portal? Yes, you can have Portal notifications sent to you at the email address associated with your Portal login. Notifications provide information about updates to UKCloud services, in addition to maintenance and incident notifications. This feature is currently not available in the Elevated Portal. Service Limitations Are there any restrictions on the number of instances I can create or manipulate in a single request? Although designed to be a large-scale cloud platform, we strongly advise that when performing operations/requests against UKCloud for OpenStack you perform these actions in batches of no more than 30 (for example, only creating batches of up to 30 new instances in a single request). Additional requests can then be made to the platform for subsequent batches. How can I create additional OpenStack Projects? Unfortunately, we are currently unable to offer customers of UKCloud for OpenStack the ability to create their own additional OpenStack Projects. Additional projects are allowed, however these need to be created by UKCloud via a Service Request from within the UKCloud Portal. How can I create additional OpenStack Users? Unfortunately, we are currently unable to offer customers of UKCloud for OpenStack the ability to create their own additional OpenStack users. Additional users are allowed, however these need to be created by UKCloud via a Service Request from within the UKCloud Portal. Onboarding How can I get started with the service? Within four hours of accepting your order, we'll create your primary administrator account, and send you a Welcome Pack, which includes the URL for the UKCloud Portal and associated authentication details. Your administrator can then create additional accounts for users within the project. Each user can then log on and begin using the service (depending on the security domain and connectivity). At the time of order, you can specify which of our two UK data centres you'd like to be deployed into. Meeting your request is at UKCloud's discretion. Is there a free trial? We offer a 30-day free trial so that you can test and evaluate our service without commitment. Your trial provides you with a live environment on the UKCloud platform to test our services and check whether they're suited to your needs. Before your trial, a Cloud Architect will engage with you to identify the goals you're working towards, to help ensure that your trial meets those goals. Throughout the trial period, a Customer Success Manager (CSM) will provide support for any issues you may encounter or questions you may have. At the end of your free trial, you can seamlessly move to a billed service, leveraging any of the work you've already completed in the live trial environment. Backup Does UKCloud back up my projects or instances? UKCloud for OpenStack is a cloud platform built specifically for cloud native applications which have been engineered to use stateless, disposable instances. UKCloud does not provide automated backups of projects or instances, however it does allow consumers to create snapshots of their instances via the OpenStack dashboard or programmatically via the API. These snapshots when used in conjunction with deployment orchestration tools or infrastructure as code templates such as HEAT allow for environments to be rapidly replicate, redeploy or scale environments. Can I create scheduled snapshots? Snapshots cannot currently be scheduled directly through OpenStack, however custom scripts can be created and are available on the internet to enable snapshots to be programmatically set. How quickly can a snapshot be restored? Snapshots recovery is full self-service and can be invoked by customers at any time via the OpenStack dashboard or API. What is the Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of the snapshots? The RPO is totally within the customers control. For example, you could programmatically schedule a snapshot to run every hour or even every minute, at which point their RPO would match the frequency of your snapshots. We don't set a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) on snapshot recovery, but this is a fully self-service function available to the customer via the dashboard or API, with restoration times never exceeding two minutes (this will depend on the size of instance being recovered). Where are snapshots stored? By default, all snapshots are stored to our persistent block storage to provide data resilience. Persistent block storage will be charged by the GiB. Can I use my own backup software? Yes, you simply install appropriate backup software within your project and specify the backup location. A typical scenario would involve using a commercial backup solution (such as Symantec NetBackup, CommVault or EMC NetWorker) that points to a cloud storage service such as our Cloud Storage. Billing and legal What is the smallest unit of time I will be billed for? The minimum unit of time for use is one hour. Part hours will be rounded up. Will I be charged for instances in a 'Shut Off' state? UKCloud will continue to charge for any resources that exist within your OpenStack project regardless of the state they're in. In order to stop any charges an instance must be fully 'Terminated'. What are the charges to transfer data between projects within the same data centre? None. Data transfer between projects in this scenario is free. How can I view billing information? Real-time billing information is currently not available as a service provided by UKCloud, however customers are able to query the OpenStack Ceilometer API to query live event data. Historic billing information is available via the UKCloud Portal. How can I pay for the services? Payment for UKCloud services can be made by direct bank transfer (BACS/CHAPS). You can find bank details for payment on your invoice. If you signed up with a credit or debit card, your payment card will be automatically charged no sooner than seven (7) days after the invoice date. How are snapshots charged? You will only ever be charged for the amount of Tier 1 or Tier 2 storage your snapshots consume, that you have scheduled via the OpenStack dashboard or the API - we do not place any additional premium on-top for the snapshot functionality. To calculate an estimated cost of performing snapshots on UKCloud for OpenStack, simply use the following formula: Cost £ = Instance Size (GiB) x Number of Snapshots to be retained (Customer controlled) x Choice of Storage (Tier 1 @ £0.25 or Tier 2 @ £0.10) As an example: If a customer has an 80GiB Tier 2 instance, and performs a snapshot every hour, but only wants to keep the current snapshot, plus the last nine snapshots then: 80 GiB x 10 (snapshots) x £0.10 = £80 per month What are the termination fees? There are no termination costs for this service. Customers are responsible for extracting their own data from the UKCloud for OpenStack service if required. UKCloud may make an additional charge for transferring data out of the service. Security What data is suitable for the UKCloud assured cloud platform? The service is hosted in the UK and operated by security-cleared staff. It has extensive independent validation (including CESG) that it is fully aligned with the 14 CESG Cloud Security Principles, and is therefore ideal for all data classified at OFFICIAL (including OFFICIAL SENSITIVE). Can systems on different UKCloud platforms communicate with one and another? UKCloud's Cross Domain Security Zone allows customers to use the UKCloud-defined and managed UKCloud Guard, or a customer-designed and managed Walled Garden to enable communication between platforms. For more information, see the Cross Domain Security Zone documentation. Is there a protective monitoring service? Protective monitoring is included for our IaaS platform and follows GPG 13.

    "keywords": "UKCloud for OpenShift life cycle and patch management Overview This article outlines the lifecycle of UKCloud-supported OpenShift releases, along with UKCloud's approach to patching existing OpenShift environments so that you can effectively plan, deploy and support your infrastructure. The purpose of this article is to provide as much transparency as possible, but UKCloud may make exceptions from the process described should the need arise. Intended audience Administrators and operators of the UKCloud for OpenShift service. Lifecycle management Red Hat's official versioning for their OpenShift Container Platform is X.Y where X indicates the major version and Y indicates a minor version. Although Red Hat officially fully support each major X version of the OpenShift Container Platform for five years, as a service provider, this duration is too long for UKCloud to ensure the highest levels of security, performance and features. As such, UKCloud will officially support the current (X.Y) and previous two minor versions (X.Y-1) and (X.Y-2) . As minor versions are released roughly every six months, this provides the assurance that your environments will be fully supported by UKCloud for a minimum of twelve months. Upgrades of major X and minor Y versions Currently, UKCloud does not offer in-place upgrades. This provides you with total flexiblility to upgrade at a time convenient to you, as well as providing the ability to test existing code and applications against any new versions prior to moving in to production. To facilitate any upgrades, UKCloud will deploy a new environment to customers based on the latest tested and approved release of OpenShift free of charge for thirty days in order to conduct any testing and migrate workloads over to the new environment. At the end of thirty days, UKCloud will shut down and remove the old environment to prevent any double-charging. Note UKCloud will actively work with you during this period to help ensure a smooth migration and will not turn off any old environments until until you advise us that it's safe to do so. Patching within current version Red Hat routinely releases patches for vulnerabilities or issues identified within the currently supported version of OpenShift. Once UKCloud has reviewed and tested any patches as being fit for release in to production, we will advise you of the patch and schedule a convenient time to apply it.

    "title": "OpenShift integrated cluster monitoring | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "OpenShift integrated cluster monitoring Overview OpenShift 3.11 ships with a pre-configured and self-updating monitoring stack based on the Prometheus open source project. The main components are Prometheus, Alertmanager and Grafana. This ships with a set of alerts that notify the cluster admin of problems and a set of Grafana dashboards. The deployed Prometheus instance is responsible for monitoring and alerting on cluster and OpenShift components. While it will enable you to monitor the compute resources of your pods using the K8s / Compute Resources / Pod Grafana dashboard, it shouldn't be extended to monitor user applications. Users interested in leveraging Prometheus for application monitoring on OpenShift should consider using the operator lifecycle manager ( https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager ) to easily deploy a Prometheus Operator and setup new Prometheus instances to monitor and alert on their applications. Alertmanager is a cluster-global component for handling alerts generated by all Prometheus instances deployed in that cluster. Resource Cluster monitoring is deployed with persistent storage, meaning that the metrics are stored on a persistent volume and can survive a pod being restarted or recreated. By default, each Alertmanager instance is allocated 2GiB and each Prometheus instance is allocated 50GiB. In a standard cluster with two infrastructure nodes this will mean 106GiB of storage will be used for cluster monitoring. If the persistent volumes fill up, or you notice them getting close to being full, you can expand the persistent volumes by following the steps in How to expand OpenShift persistent volumes or by raising a Service Request in the UKCloud Portal. Configuration If you'd like to change the behaviour of Alertmanager, for example, have alerts notify somebody by email, you'll need to raise a Service Request with us via the Portal. In the request let us know the cluster and the Alertmanager configuration you'd like to be used and we can then reconfigure the cluster-monitoring using the OpenShift ansible playbooks used to deploy it. If you attempt to edit the configMaps or secrets directly to insert this configuration, the cluster-monitoring operator will detect these changes and restore default values. You can use the following documentation page as a reference when creating Alertmanger config: https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/configuration/ . Note The OCP 3.11 delivery of the Prometheus Alertmanager only includes a default template. Configurations requiring a specific template should be avoided as they may lead to failures to reconfigure the cluster-monitoring. It is possible to inject additional configuration into the stack. However, this is unsupported by Red Hat, as configuration paradigms might change across Prometheus releases, and such cases can only be handled gracefully if all configuration possibilities are controlled. Accessing Web UIs oc get routes -n openshift-monitoring will give you the URLs you can use to access Prometheus, Alertmanager and Grafana UIs. You'll need to prepend https:// to the addresses. Grafana Dashboards If you navigate to the Grafana web UI you'll be able to access a number of pre-configured dashboards. These dashboards provide insight into the compute resource usage at cluster, node and pod levels. There are also USE Method dashboards at the cluster and node level. Click the dropdown in the top left on the home dashboard to select which dashboard you'd like to view. Configuring custom dashboards isn't a supported option. If you require custom dashboards we recommend standing up your own grafana instance and connecting that into the cluster monitoring Prometheus.

    "title": "How to restrict access to OpenShift routes by IP address | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to restrict access to OpenShift routes by IP address Overview This knowledge centre article explains how OpenShift developers can restrict access to the routes they create to their deployed services in OpenShift by IP address. Restricting access in this way increases the security of a route by allowing only trusted IPs to access the OpenShift route. Intended audience OpenShift developers who have created and deployed services into OpenShift, and created and exposed routes for those services. This article describes how to further secure access to those exposed routes by allowing only trusted IPs to access them. Restricting access to a route After creating and exposing a route in OpenShift in the usual manner, you can then add an annotation to the route specifying the IP address(es) that you would like to whitelist. Important Whitelisting a IP address automatically blacklists everything else. You apply the annotation to a route in the following manner: oc annotate route <route_name> haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist=<ip_address> Important You must do this for every route that you wish to apply the whitelisting to. Examples To allow a single IP address through to the route, use the following: oc annotate route <route_name> haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist=192.168.1.10 To allow several IP addresses through to the route, separate each IP with a space: oc annotate route <route_name> haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist=192.168.1.10 192.168.1.11 192.168.1.12 To allow a network CIDR through to the route, declare the network CIDR as so: oc annotate route <route_name> haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist=192.168.1.10/24 You can even use a mix of IP addresses and a network CIDR: oc annotate route <route_name> haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist=192.168.1.10 180.5.61.153 192.168.1.0/24 10.0.0.0/8 To delete the IPs from the annotation, you can run the command: oc annotate route <route_name> haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist- More information For further infomation, see the following: Openshift Documentation Important This functionality is available by default in UKCloud OpenShift deployments of version 3.10 or newer. For all previous versions customers need to raise a request with UKCloud to have this functionality enabled.

    "title": "How to publish application routes to multiple networks | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to publish application routes to multiple networks Overview This article provides instructions on how to make use of multiple external networks from within an OpenShift cluster. If you've requested an OpenShift cluster with multple networks from UKCloud you'll have multiple data planes - usually one for the internet and one for the community network you’ve requested be added to your deployment. Building applications that listen on these networks is relatively straightforward, but requires some specific configuration to be put in place on your application routes. This guide should help explain how you go about exposing your application on the relevant networks. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have access to and a working knowledge of oc , the OpenShift command-line client (CLI). For more information, see OpenShift's Get Started with the CLI . High level overview Firstly, an explanation of what gets deployed: the cluster will have front-end load balancers that sit outside OpenShift, which essentially do TCP passthrough of incoming traffic to the OpenShift routers deployed inside your cluster. As a cluster administrator, you can see the OpenShift routers by viewing the default project. You'll also have another set of routers that run on the community network facing nodes that provide termination of inbound traffic from the community network. The three scenarios shown in the above diagram are as follows: Traffic from the internet to application-1 (blue lines) Traffic from the internet and a community network to application-2 (green and red lines) Traffic from a community network to application-3 only (purple lines) We'll be using some basic example applications to demonstrate publishing routes in each of these three application scenarios. Process and code examples Scenario 1 - Traffic from the internet to application-1 First we'll create a project called routersharding and the three applications to demonstrate with: $ oc new-project routersharding Now using project \"routersharding\" on server \"https://console.x-y-zzz-abcdef:8443\". $ oc new-app centos/ruby-22-centos7~https://github.com/openshift/ruby-ex.git --name=application-1 $ oc new-app centos/ruby-22-centos7~https://github.com/openshift/ruby-ex.git --name=application-2 $ oc new-app centos/ruby-22-centos7~https://github.com/openshift/ruby-ex.git --name=application-3 $ oc get svc NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE application-1 ClusterIP x.y.144.215 <none> 8080/TCP 1m application-2 ClusterIP x.y.122.177 <none> 8080/TCP 1m application-3 ClusterIP x.y.247.162 <none> 8080/TCP 1m $ oc expose svc application-1 route \"application-1\" exposed $ oc get routes NAME HOST/PORT PATH SERVICES PORT TERMINATION WILDCARD application-1 application-1-routersharding.demo-env.region1.cna.ukcloud.com application-1 8080-tcp None Now to see that your route has been published, you can describe the route and see where it's been exposed, or you can review the routes in the default router by opening a session to the router pod and reviewing the configuration. Find a router pod - in this case labelled router-<buildno>-<uniqueid> : $ oc project default Now using project \"default\" on server \"https://console.x-y-zzz-abcdef:8443\". $ oc get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE docker-registry-1-466xv 1/1 Running 0 16h registry-console-2-bff2q 1/1 Running 0 18h router-4-bjqz2 1/1 Running 0 8h router-4-q5g6g 1/1 Running 0 8h router-secondary-2-f2p8z 1/1 Running 0 1d router-secondary-2-nr2lm 1/1 Running 0 15d Remotely launch an interactive shell in a router and look at the routes.json file to see our route is published: $ oc rsh router-4-bjqz2 sh-4.2$ cat /var/lib/haproxy/router/routes.json | grep application-1-routersharding \"Host\": \"application-1-routersharding.demo-env.region1.cna.ukcloud.com\", Similarly, we can see that no routes are currently published on the router-secondary pods: $ oc get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE docker-registry-1-466xv 1/1 Running 0 1h registry-console-2-bff2q 1/1 Running 0 3h router-1-6fzkh 1/1 Running 0 1h router-1-pzjrj 1/1 Running 0 50d router-secondary-2-f2p8z 1/1 Running 0 1d router-secondary-2-nr2lm 1/1 Running 0 15d $ oc rsh router-secondary-2-f2p8z sh-4.2$ cat /var/lib/haproxy/router/routes.json {} So that shows the basic route is now published, which fulfils scenario 1 shown in the diagram above. Scenario 2 - Traffic from the internet and a community network to application-2 To make the route appear on the secondary router and achieve scenario 2, we need to label the route appropriately so that it's also exposed on the router-secondary pods. By default, we setup the secondary routers with a label based route selector of \"router-secondary=true\" . Here we see the route selector label setup on the secondary router. This indicates that this route will publish routes that are labelled with \"router-secondary=true\" : $ oc describe dc router-secondary | grep ROUTE_LABELS ROUTE_LABELS: router-secondary=true Now we need to switch back to our application project and make the changes to our application b to meet scenario 2: $ oc project routersharding Now using project \"routersharding\" on server \"https://console.x-y-zzz-abcdef:8443\". First, we expose the route on the default router as before: $ oc expose svc application-2 route \"application-2\" exposed # we can apply the label to expose our route on the secondary router with the following command $ oc label route application-2 \"router-secondary=true\" route \"application-2\" labeled By describing the route, we can now see it's been exposed on both routers (see exposed on lines below): $ oc describe route application-2 Name: application-2 Namespace: routersharding Created: 3 minutes ago Labels: app=application-2 router-secondary=true Annotations: openshift.io/host.generated=true Requested Host: application-2-routersharding.demo-env.region1.cna.ukcloud.com exposed on router router 3 minutes ago exposed on router router-secondary 2 minutes ago Path: <none> TLS Termination: <none> Insecure Policy: <none> Endpoint Port: 8080-tcp Service: application-2 Weight: 100 (100%) Endpoints: 10.128.4.24:8080 Reviewing the routes on the router-secondary pods as before also shows our route now exposed there: $ oc rsh router-secondary-2-f2p8z sh-4.2$ cat /var/lib/haproxy/router/routes.json { \"routersharding:application-2\": { \"Name\": \"application-2\", \"Namespace\": \"routersharding\", \"Host\": \"application-2-routersharding.demo-env.region1.cna.ukcloud.com\", \"Path\": \"\", \"TLSTermination\": \"\", \"Certificates\": null, \"VerifyServiceHostname\": false, \"Status\": \"saved\", \"PreferPort\": \"8080-tcp\", \"InsecureEdgeTerminationPolicy\": \"\", \"RoutingKeyName\": \"8647b1a7d5f913923a2eae0e1d02df09\", \"IsWildcard\": false, \"Annotations\": { \"openshift.io/host.generated\": \"true\" }, \"ServiceUnits\": { \"routersharding/application-2\": 100 }, \"ServiceUnitNames\": { \"routersharding/application-2\": 256 }, \"ActiveServiceUnits\": 1, \"ActiveEndpoints\": 1 } } Scenario 3 - Traffic from a community network to application-3 only The final scenario for application-3 requires modification of the original routers to ensure they don’t select routes with a specific label (by default they expose all of the routes we expose). We’ll recreate the same application in a new project called test-project1 to demonstrate this. First, we edit the existing default router to tell it not to select routes that have a label of isolated=true : $ oc project default Now using project \"default\" on server \"https://console.x-y-zzz-abcdef:8443\". $ oc set env dc/router ROUTE_LABELS='isolated != true' deploymentconfig \"router” updated We can now create a new basic route with that label and see that it doesn't appear on any router: $ oc expose svc application-3 --labels=\"isolated=true\" route \"application-3\" exposed $ oc describe route application-3 Name: application-3 Namespace: routersharding Created: 19 seconds ago Labels: isolated=true Annotations: openshift.io/host.generated=true Requested Host: application-3-routersharding.demo-env.region1.cna.ukcloud.com Path: <none> TLS Termination: <none> Insecure Policy: <none> Endpoint Port: 8080-tcp Service: application-3 Weight: 100 (100%) Endpoints: 10.129.2.20:8080 Notice that this doesn't appear to be exposed on any routers. We can check this on the routers quickly as we have previously: $ oc project default Now using project \"default\" on server \"https://console.x-y-zzz-abcdef:8443\". $ oc rsh router-4-bjqz2 sh-4.2$ cat /var/lib/haproxy/router/routes.json | grep application-3-routersharding <no results> Similarly, it's not appearing on our secondary router either: $ oc rsh router-secondary-2-f2p8z sh-4.2$ cat /var/lib/haproxy/router/routes.json | grep application-3-routersharding <no results> Now we can just expose this route on the secondary routers by tagging it with the appropriate label for those routers: $ oc project routersharding Now using project \"routersharding\" on server \"https://console.x-y-zzz-abcdef:8443\". $ oc label route application-3 \"router-secondary=true\" route \"application-3\" labeled $ oc describe route application-3 Name: application-3 Namespace: routersharding Created: 3 minutes ago Labels: isolated=true router-secondary=true Annotations: openshift.io/host.generated=true Requested Host: application-3-routersharding.demo-env.region1.cna.ukcloud.com exposed on router router-secondary 4 seconds ago Path: <none> TLS Termination: <none> Insecure Policy: <none> Endpoint Port: 8080-tcp Service: application-3 Weight: 100 (100%) Endpoints: 10.129.2.20:8080 # notice how this route now is showing as exposed on router-secondary. We can verify this as before. $ oc project default Now using project \"default\" on server \"https://console.x-y-zzz-abcdef:8443\". $ oc rsh router-secondary-2-f2p8z $ oc rsh router-secondary-2-f2p8z sh-4.2$ cat /var/lib/haproxy/router/routes.json { \"routersharding:application-2\": { \"Name\": \"application-2\", \"Namespace\": \"routersharding\", \"Host\": \"application-2-routersharding.demo-env.region1.cna.ukcloud.com\", \"Path\": \"\", \"TLSTermination\": \"\", \"Certificates\": null, \"VerifyServiceHostname\": false, \"Status\": \"saved\", \"PreferPort\": \"8080-tcp\", \"InsecureEdgeTerminationPolicy\": \"\", \"RoutingKeyName\": \"8647b1a7d5f913923a2eae0e1d02df09\", \"IsWildcard\": false, \"Annotations\": { \"openshift.io/host.generated\": \"true\" }, \"ServiceUnits\": { \"routersharding/application-2\": 100 }, \"ServiceUnitNames\": { \"routersharding/application-2\": 256 }, \"ActiveServiceUnits\": 1, \"ActiveEndpoints\": 1 }, \"routersharding:application-3\": { \"Name\": \"application-3\", \"Namespace\": \"routersharding\", \"Host\": \"application-3-routersharding.demo-env.region1.cna.ukcloud.com\", \"Path\": \"\", \"TLSTermination\": \"\", \"Certificates\": null, \"VerifyServiceHostname\": false, \"Status\": \"\", \"PreferPort\": \"8080-tcp\", \"InsecureEdgeTerminationPolicy\": \"\", \"RoutingKeyName\": \"187190814c4acaea9156fd0ca476bd4f\", \"IsWildcard\": false, \"Annotations\": { \"openshift.io/host.generated\": \"true\" }, \"ServiceUnits\": { \"routersharding/application-3\": 100 }, \"ServiceUnitNames\": null, \"ActiveServiceUnits\": 1, \"ActiveEndpoints\": 0 } } The above shows both the routes we've created in this demo now on router-secondary . Note If you want to expose applications on a private network, the above logic still applies. The only differences are that the deployment config for the router is called router-private and the route label required to expose your routes is router-private=true .

The way around this is to use a deploy key . This guide assumes you have access to the command-line oc client, and have logged in to your OpenShift cluster with oc login . Building an OpenShift application from a private GitHub repository Create an ssh key-pair Note Don't use your regular one, and make sure you don't overwrite your regular one either. ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -c \"jbloggs@example.com\" -f my_GitHub_deploy_key This will generate both the private and public key files.

    "keywords": "Global load balancing Service Scope About this document This document is intended to provide additional information regarding the optional Global load balancing service that is available for UKCloud services within the UKCloud for VMware service description. For additional information, please refer to the Global load balancing FAQs . About Global load balancer This service is aimed at providing a secure and reliable managed DNS service to help businesses enable and protect their online presence. It ensures a high level of website availability and optimal performance, with built-in security for superior protection that is scalable to future demands. It enables customers to direct Internet traffic between multiple end-points which can be across different sites or different platforms. UKCloud have partnered with Neustar for the provision of this service along with the additional option of Application-tuned DDoS protection for a complete traffic protection solution. Traffic management services Basic traffic routing services for monitored load balancing and failover are included services with the Global Load Balancing service. Monitor and automatically load balance or failover traffic at the DNS level by distributing traffic among multiple servers. Our advanced traffic routing services help to further optimise your traffic, allowing granular control of load balancing and failover options to configure different thresholds for notifications and traffic routing actions. Monitoring and failover The service monitors and automatically fails over DNS traffic in the event of underperforming or unavailable servers. Utilising a network of monitoring servers, you can select specific records to monitor and, if needed, have traffic redirected to a \"hot\" standby. Comprehensive server- specific health checks further ensure your DNS traffic flows without interruption. Traffic controller The service optimises traffic and network performance at the DNS level. Based on parameters you set, weighted load balancing lets you distribute traffic among multiple servers. This allows you to increase the performance and scalability of your service applications while reducing the costs of data centres utilised as back-ups. Directional DNS Accelerate service and enable localised website content routing by IP, Autonomous System Number (ASN), and combine with Geolocation for highly targeted routing solutions. Service Background Highly redundant network with 30 nodes across 6 continents 100% uptime SLA Super fault-tolerant N+1 architecture High performance, low latency response times across the globe Built-in DDoS protection included 24/7 Free Customer Support Load balancing and failover with alerts Geo-IP Directional Routing and Country Blocking Name Server segmentation for added security and performance Easy-to-use web portal Secure two-factor authentication, Access Control List, SSL protected portal Advanced permissions Single click DNSSEC and IPv6 compliant RESTAPI Primary, secondary, and hidden master support EDNS0 Client-Subnet enabled SSAE 16, Type-II compliant Portal access Once the service is provisioned, access details for your web-based portal will be supplied to you. This portal will allow you complete control over the solution, and settings for traffic and mitigation. The service is delivered as a managed service by Neustar and they are responsible for monitoring traffic, the availability of servers and taking necessary actions to prevent a loss of service. However, the performance of the service is reliant on the details and settings within the portal. It is important that you ensure as much detail is supplied to Neustar on the expected traffic, spikes in traffic and preferences on traffic routing. Service provisioning Once a contract is signed by the customer, the service will be provisioned by Neustar who will then directly provide portal access details. The time to provision will depend on complexity of the solution. Feedback If you find an issue with this article, click Improve this Doc to suggest a change.

    "title": "Cross Domain Security Zone FAQs | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Cross Domain Security Zone FAQs Service What is the service? The UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone (CDSZ) enables customers to transfer data securely between the UKCloud Assured OFFICIAL (formerly IL2) cloud platform and the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL (formerly IL3) cloud platform using CESG-approved cross-domain security patterns. This allows solutions hosted on the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform that are citizen facing to be accessed securely from the internet. Two service options are available to enable use of the CDSZ: UKCloud Guard Walled Garden Do I have to buy other UKCloud services to use services in the CDSZ? Yes. UKCloud cross-domain services are available only to customers purchasing other UKCloud services, such as IaaS (compute and storage) or PaaS (UKCloud for OpenShift). Is there a free trial available for either service option? The complex assurance requirements mean that trials aren't available. What is the process for applying for a service in the CDSZ? You can find the information you need in the UKCloud Knowledge Centre, including a detailed description of the assurance process. How do I enable access from the internet to my solution hosted on the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform? For citizen-facing solutions hosted on the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform that need to be accessible from the internet, you can use the UKCloud Guard, or build your own solution using the Walled Garden. If you use the UKCloud Guard, you'll need to deploy additional web servers on the Assured OFFICIAL cloud platform to perform pre-authentication, validation checking and initial anti-virus. The web servers can then communicate with your application server hosted on the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform via HTTP web services through the UKCloud Guard. Use of the UKCloud Guard is subject to approval by the UKCloud SIRO. With the Walled Garden, you can create your own inspection, anti-malware and security services in the CDSZ between the internet-facing components on the Assured OFFICIAL cloud platform and the higher-security components hosted on the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform. Use of a self-managed Walled garden is subject to approval by the UKCloud SIRO. Direct connectivity into the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform via the internet is possible using a CAPS-approved VPN solution using government-grade encryption products (for example, Kryptor). CPA-approved (or equivalent standard) VPN solutions may be used subject to approval by the UKCloud SIRO. UKCloud can host the IPsec VPN gateway device within the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform, but procurement, configuration and ongoing management of the solution are your responsibility. UKCloud also offers Secure Remote Access, a CPA-approved VPN solution that allows access to the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform via a self-managed walled garden within the CDSZ. For more information, see the UKCloud Secure Remote Access service description on the Digital Marketplace. Are there any bandwidth limitations for traffic traversing the walled garden firewalls in and out of the CDSZ? Yes, there is a 1GB throughput limitation to the CDSZ in both Farnborough and Corsham. Is there storage capacity on CDSZ virtual machines (VMs)? The storage capacity of a VM in the CDSZ is 60GB. UKCloud cannot provide additional storage in the CDSZ for designs involving patch repositories. We advise customers to engage a UKCloud solutions architect to create a design that allows use of storage on the Assured or the Elevated platform. What information do I need to include in my application for a service in the CDSZ? As a minimum the application must include: A business case explaining why a cross-domain solution is required The technical architecture of the solution - incorporating either the UKCloud Guard or your proposed Walled Garden solution An assurance plan - your proposed approach to ensuring that risks are correctly identified, appropriate mitigation is implemented and residual risks are accepted, so that both the UKCloud and customer SIROs can make an informed decision about the risks of the solution UKCloud Guard What is the UKCloud Guard? UKCloud provides a secure and scalable Guard which supports structured and inspectable HTTP-based data flows. This service offers an immediately available (subject to the assurance process) multi-tenant Guard to support simple use cases. What data can the UKCloud Guard inspect? It can inspect structured and inspectable HTTP-based data such as XML and JSON. Does UKCloud support JSON and are there any 'rules' around it? Both guards (IWSVA and Deep Secure) can currently pass through JSON content. This is currently based on both products recognising the content as text. Can I change the data that's allowed to flow through the UKCloud Guard? No. Any changes to what is and isn't allowed through the guard will be decided at a service level by UKCloud. If you need a different solution, we recommend you use the Walled Garden. Can I design a redundant UKCloud Guard? Yes. You can implement a dual-site option that provides a secondary guard route in case the primary one fails. How long will the assurance process take? Each business case and proposed solution will be assessed by the UKCloud team, and must be approved by the UKCloud SIRO. We aim to carry out the assessment within five days of receiving the business case and proposed solution, but we can't commit to timelines for approval. Self-managed Walled Garden What is the self-managed Walled Garden? We provide self-service access to the CDSZ so that customers can create their own Walled gardens using the technology and application services of their choice. We provide an assurance wrap by ensuring that customers use appropriate risk management techniques to understand and mitigate identified risks. Is there a setup fee for a Walled Garden? No. What is the assurance wrap? Because a Walled Garden Solution is bespoke, we offer an assurance wrap to guide customers towards an effective design that will help to maximise their chances of meeting compliance requirements. The variable nature of Walled Garden Solutions means we may charge for the assurance wrap on an SFIA rate card basis, according to the number of days' support needed. What is the process for approving a Walled Garden? Broadly, the process is as follows: Initial application UKCloud design review (with a cloud architect) Proposed evidence pack submission (by the customer) Full evidence pack submission (by the customer) UKCloud SIRO review and approval or rejection Full details of each stage are available in the UKCloud Knowledge Centre or from your account director. What type of evidence is required to allow use of the Walled Garden? The evidence pack will generally consist of: IT Security Health Check (ITSHC) This must be carried out by an NCSC-approved security organisation Protective Monitoring solution The nature of Walled Garden solutions makes it essential that appropriate audit logging of security events and information is implemented and regularly monitored. Customer SIRO sign-off We need an accreditor's statement confirming their acceptance of the risk assessment, mitigating controls and residual risks, and their understanding of the customer's obligations relating to the use of UKCloud services What are the ongoing requirements? When the Walled Garden is in operation, the customer is responsible for ensuring continuing compliance with security operating procedures (SyOps) and other security obligations. How long will the assurance process take? The bespoke nature of the Walled Garden means we can't provide committed timescales for each phase in the process. However, we aim to provide feedback from a named source within five days of each submission. Who makes the final decision to allow or deny the use of a Walled Garden? The UKCloud SIRO is ultimately responsible for deciding which solutions and configurations are allowed. Support How do I raise a support ticket?- Our secure online Portal provides service management functionality. Alternatively, you can reach support by phone or email. How do I manage my services? Walled Gardens are managed from the higher-security side of the platform (Elevated OFFICIAL). The security requirements are much stricter and require a PSN-approved connection, UKCloud Secure Remote Access or CPA-approved (or equivalent standard) encryption. What are your service maintenance windows? UKCloud's maintenance windows are as follows (times are UK local times): Planned maintenance Any pre-planned maintenance of any infrastructure relating to the services. We'll provide you with at least 14 days' advance notice of any planned maintenance. It will take place between 00:00 and 06:00 Monday to Sunday or between 08:00 and 12:00 on a Saturday or Sunday. No planned maintenance will take place on a Saturday unless agreed in advance by both parties. Emergency Maintenance Any emergency maintenance of any infrastructure relating to the services. Whenever possible, we'll provide you with at least six hours' advance notice of emergency maintenance; and carry it out between 00:00 and 06:00 Monday to Sunday or between 08:00 and 12:00 on a Saturday or Sunday, unless there's an identified and demonstrable immediate risk to a customer's environment. Billing and legal How will I be billed? Both solutions have a minimum commitment period of one month. The billing models are as follows: UKCloud Guard Billing is based on the amount of data transferred between domains. You buy a starter pack which includes an amount of data that can be transferred. You're billed at an incremental rate for data transferred above the starter pack threshold. Walled Garden Billing is based on the solution design. You pay a monthly rental fee, with additional charges based on the number of VMs required to run the solution. How do I pay for the service? Payment can be made by direct bank transfer (BACS/CHAPS). What are the termination fees? There are no termination fees for most services. We may make an additional charge for transferring data out of the service if this is required.

It will guide you through the creation of: an Azure application a service principal name role assignment permissions What is a service principal name? An Azure service principal name (SPN) is a security identity used by user-created applications, services, and automation tools to access specific Azure resources. Think of it as a 'user identity' (username and password or certificate) with a specific role, and tightly controlled permissions. It only needs to be able to do specific things, unlike a general user identity. It improves security if you grant it only the minimum permissions level needed to perform its management tasks. To log in and manage your resources via SPN you'll need to create an Azure application and then assign SPN to it. Only then will you be able to perform tasks against your environment.

This guide shows you how to create a pool of back-end servers and a load balancer to spread traffic across them. In this example, the load balancer spreads traffic across two web servers. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide, you must have appropriate access to a subscription in the Azure Stack portal. Creating a load balancer In this section we will create a load balancer with a public IP address. Log in to the Azure Stack portal. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for Microsoft Azure . In the favourites panel, select Create a resource . In the New blade, select Networking . In the Featured section, select Load Balancer . In the Create load balancer blade, enter the following information: Name - The name of the load balancer. Type - You can use internal load balancers to balance traffic from private IP addresses. Public load balancers can balance traffic originating from public IP addresses. For this example we will be creating a public load balancer. Public IP Address - The public IP address that will be assigned to this load balancer. To create a new public IP address: Click Public IP address on the Create load balancer blade. Select Create new on the Choose public IP address blade. Enter a name for the public IP address and click OK . Subscription - This is your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure subscription and will be pre-populated by default. Resource Group - Select an existing resource group, or create a new one by typing a name for your new resource group. Location - This will be frn00006 , which is the location of the Azure Stack. Click Create . Create back-end servers In this section we will create a virtual network and two virtual machines which exist on this network. This will form the back-end pool of the load balancer. Create a virtual network In the favourites panel, select Create a resource . In the New blade, select Networking . In the Featured section, select Virtual network . In the Create virtual network blade, enter the following information: Name - The name of the virtual network. Address Space - The virtual network's address range in CIDR notation (for example, 192.168.1.0/16). Subscription - This is your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure subscription and will be pre-populated by default. Resource Group - Select an existing resource group, or create a new one by typing a name for your new resource group. Location - This will be frn00006 , which is the location of the Azure Stack. Subnet Name - The name of the first subnet within the virtual network. Address Range - The subnet's address range in CIDR notation (for example, 192.168.1.0/24). It must be contained by the address space of the virtual network. The address range of a subnet which is in use can't be edited. Click Create . Create the virtual machines In the favourites panel, select Create a resource . In the New blade, select Compute . In the Compute blade, select the template that you want to use for your VM. In the Create virtual machine blade, in the Basics step, enter general information about the VM, including a name, credentials and resource group, then click OK . In the Size step, select the appropriate size for your VM, depending on its purpose, then click Select . For information about the different available VM sizes, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-vm-sizes . Tip By default, the list shows a selection of recommended VM sizes. To see all available VM sizes, click View all . In the Settings step, change any of the optional settings as required for your VM, then click OK . Ensure that the virtual network created earlier is selected and that the VM belongs to an availability set. To create a new availability set: Click Availability set on the Create virtual machine blade. Select Create new on the Change availability set blade. Enter a name for the availability set and the number of fault domains and update domains, then click OK . In the Summary step, review the selections you've made and then click OK to start the deployment. Create another VM, ensuring that the Availability set , Virtual network , Subnet and Network Security Group are the same. Create network security group rules In this section we will create NSG rules to allow inbound traffic. Navigate to your network security group by clicking on All services in the favourites panel, then selecting Network security groups under the networking section. Select the network security group your VMs are using from the list. In the blade for your network security group, select Inbound security rules under the Settings section. Click the +Add button. In the Add inbound security rule blade, enter the following information: Source - The source filter can be Any, an IP address range, or a default tag. It specifies the incoming traffic from a specific source IP address range that will be allowed or denied by this rule. Source port range - Provide a single port, such as 80, or a port range, such as 1024-65535. This specifies from which ports traffic will be allowed or denied by this rule. Use an asterisk (*) to allow traffic on any port. Destination - The destination filter can be Any, an IP address range, or a default tag. It specifies the outgoing traffic for a specific destination IP address range that will be allowed or denied by this rule. Destination port range - Provide a single port, such as 80, or a port range, such as 1024-65535. This specifies from which ports traffic will be allowed or denied by this rule. Use an asterisk (*) to allow traffic on any port. Protocol - Specify whether to allow inbound traffic using UDP, TCP or both. Action - Choose whether the rule allows or denies the traffic specified. Priority - Rules are processed in priority order; the lower the number, the higher the priority. We recommend leaving gaps between rules - 100, 200, 300, etc. - so that it's easier to add new rules without having to edit existing rules. Name - The name of the security rule. Description - A description of the security rule. Click Add . Create a back-end address pool To spread traffic load across the VMs, you must create a back-end address pool. This pool contains the IP addresses of the VMs. Navigate to your load balancer by clicking All services in the favourites panel, then selecting Load balancers under the networking section. From the list, select the load balancer you created earlier. In the blade for your load balancer, select Backend pools under the Settings section. Click the +Add button. In the Add backend pool blade, enter a name for the backend pool. Select Availability set for the Associated to option, then select the availability set that you created in the previous section. Click the + Add a target network IP configuration button, select the first VM you created in the previous section and select the network IP to be associated with the back-end pool. Repeat step 7 for the second VM. Click OK . Create a health probe When creating a load balancer, you can use a health probe to monitor the status of your application. In Azure Stack, the health probe adds and removes VMs from the load balancer back-end pool based on their current status. Navigate to your load balancer by clicking All services in the favourites panel, then selecting Load balancers under the networking section. From the list, select the load balancer you created earlier. In the blade for your load balancer, select Health Probes under the Settings section. Click the +Add button. In the Add health probe blade, enter the following information: Name - The name of your health probe. Protocol - The protocol that the health probe uses to monitor the status of your VMs. Port - The port that the health probe uses to monitor the status of your VMs. Interval - The number of seconds between probe attempts. Unhealthy threshold - The number of consecutive probe failures that must occur before a virtual machine is considered unhealthy and is removed from the pool. Click OK . Create a load balancing rule A load balancer rule defines how traffic is distributed between VMs. The rule listens for traffic on a front-end IP address, then distributes it among the back-end pool. Navigate to your load balancer by clicking on All services in the favourites panel, then selecting Load balancers under the networking section. From the list, select the load balancer you created earlier. In the blade for your load balancer, select Load balancing rules under the Settings section. Click the +Add button. In the Add load balancing rule blade, enter the following information: Name - The name of your load balancing rule. Frontend IP address - Clients communicating with this load balancer on the selected IP address and service will have their traffic routed to the target virtual machine by this NAT rule. Protocol - The protocol that the rule redirects traffic for. Port - The front-end port that the rule listens on. Backend port - You can choose to route traffic to the virtual machines in the back-end pool using a different port than the one clients use to communicate with the load balancer. Backend pool - The virtual machines in the selected back-end pool will be the target for the load-balanced traffic of this rule. Select the pool that you created in the previous section. Health probe - The selected probe is used by this rule to determine which virtual machines in the back-end pool are healthy and can receive load-balanced traffic. Select the probe that you created in the previous section. Session Persistence - Session persistence specifies that traffic from a client should be handled by the same virtual machine in the back-end pool for the duration of a session. None specifies that successive requests from the same client may be handled by any virtual machine. Client IP specifies that successive requests from the same client IP address will be handled by the same virtual machine. Client IP and protocol specifies that successive requests from the same client IP address and protocol combination will be handled by the same virtual machine. Idle timeout - Keep a TCP or HTTP connection open without relying on clients to send keep-alive messages. Click OK . Test the load balancer After installing the application that is being load-balanced on each of the VMs, the load balancer is ready to test. Navigate to your load balancer by clicking All services in the favourites panel, then selecting Load balancers under the networking section. From the list, select the load balancer you created earlier. Copy the Public IP address from the Overview section. Test the connection to your application. For example, if the app is a web server, paste the public IP into the address bar of your browser. The home page of the web server should be displayed.

    "keywords": "HSCN and SSL certificates Overview This article outlines how you can get SSL certificates for web services hosted on HSCN. Domain names Before you can get SSL certificates for your web site, you must get a domain name that you can use on the HSCN. This can come in two forms: nhs.uk domain non nhs.uk domain nhs.uk domain Typically nhs.uk domains are reserved for NHS organisations only, however in some circumstances these may be successfully applied for by private organisations. There is guidance available about domain namespace policy available at https://digital.nhs.uk/services/networking-addressing/namespace-policy . You should apply for an nhs.uk domain by emailing the NHS DNS Team ( dnsteam@nhs.net ). If you have an nhs.uk domain name, you'll get a subdomain on the HSCN internal DNS service with a suitable A record. Non nhs.uk domain If you don't have an nhs.uk domain name, you may use your own domain name that has been adapted for use on HSCN. For example, if you don't already have a domain then you can create the internet domain of example.org then purchase an internet-based DNS service and create an A record in the DNS that maps to your HSCN IP address, for example, hscn.example.org maps to HSCN.IP.x.x . Getting SSL certificates When you have set up your domain, you can then get an SSL certificate. Go to a certificate provider, for example, Comodo or GoDaddy, and go through the validation process. Generally, this involves validation against emails to the specific domain you want to get a certificate for, for example, hostmaster@example.nhs.uk or administrator@example.org , though this process differs between providers. You should also decide what type of certificate you want, and this will affect the validation process. If you're unable to validate against an email address, then you should talk to your supplier about other methods of validation. Neither UKCloud nor NHS Digital provide SSL certificates and neither have preferred suppliers for SSL certs. Installing SSL certificates You are responsible for the installation of the SSL certificates in the appropriate place(s), for example, load balancers, SSL offloaders or web servers, by whoever administers the web site. UKCloud are not responsible for the installation or management of certificates. Feedback If you find an issue with this article, click Improve this Doc to suggest a change.

    "keywords": "Janet connectivity FAQs What is Janet? Janet is the UK's research and education network. It is connected to all education organisations and research councils. Who is entitled to connect to the Janet network? Any organisation that is either publicly funded or receives government or EU funding to drive digital initiatives are entitled to use the Janet network. Can I use UKCloud's Janet connection without using cloud services provided by UKCloud? No. We can only provide a Janet connection to customers who use our cloud services, such as our Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) or Software as a Service (SaaS) offerings. Does UKCloud provide local connections to the Janet network? No. We can't arrange Janet connections to third-party offices. We only enable our customers and partners to provide services via the Janet network, using applications and solutions hosted on the UKCloud Assured OFFICIAL cloud platform. Does UKCloud support dedicated Janet connections? Yes. Our HybridConnect service option allows customers and partners to provide their own private circuits, including dedicated Janet connections. If you would like a dedicated Janet connection to our cloud platform, we can arrange for the installation of dedicated Janet circuits to each of our UK data centres. Which UKCloud data centre has Janet connectivity? Currently only our Farnborough site is connected to Janet. However, customers whose environments are in Corsham can still connect via our secure data centre interconnectivity. We are working on making Janet connectivity available in our Corsham site and will keep all customers updated when the circuit is ready for service. How do I get a Janet connection via the UKCloud Assured OFFICIAL security domain? To place an order for a Janet connection, please raise a Service Request (SR) via the UKCloud Portal or speak to your Technical Account Manager (TAM). Can I get a Janet connection via the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL security domain? No, Janet connections are only available in our Assured OFFICAL security domain. I have multiple vShield Edges and need to configure a specific Janet route. How do I set this up? To configure specific routing to allow access to each network, a routing table is available from UKCloud support. If I already have a Janet connection, can I use cloud services provided by UKCloud? Yes. A pre-existing connection to Janet will reduce the amount of time required to provision services via the Janet network based on the UKCloud Assured OFFICIAL security domain. Is there an SLA on Janet connectivity? We provide an SLA for availability of our core services such as UKCloud for VMware and UKCloud for OpenStack. We cannot provide an SLA on external services as they are outside of our control. How can I whitelist source Janet IP addresses on the edge gateway? You can log onto the UKCloud Portal and, within vCloud Director administration edit the firewall settings to allow or deny incoming connections from external IP addresses. See the How to create firewall rules for more details. Can I use UKCloud as a transit or gateway between different connections? No. Our cloud platforms are designed so that all traffic either originates or terminates within our platform. We can't facilitate routing between connections. If your solution needs to service users on different networks, this will need to be implemented, managed and accredited within your application or through an authorised gateway service. Is there a minimum commitment period? There is no minimum commitment for Janet connectivity. How will I be billed? There is no charge for Janet connectivity or for the first IP address for each data centre you are connected to the Janet network. Additional IP addresses will need to be justified and an admin fee will apply of £20 per additional IP address that is set up. There is no charge for bringing your own Janet IP addresses. Will I incur an upfront cost (setup fee)? UKCloud will set up new connections to the Janet network for you free of charge.

    "keywords": "HybridConnect FAQs What is HybridConnect? HybridConnect makes it easy for you to create hybrid clouds by securely connecting to the UKCloud assured cloud platform and supports a variety of flexible private connectivity options enabling hybrid topologies. These include connectivity to Crown Hosting facilities and to secure suites in UKCloud data centres, third-party data centres, at compatible cloud service providers, and in other customer data centre facilities. Available private connections include: CAS(T)-compliant circuits (leased lines and MPLS) with CPA-approved (or equivalent standard) overlay encryption CPA-approved (or equivalent standard) VPN solutions, which may be hosted for secure connectivity over the internet Secure fibre connectivity within UKCloud data centres Are there any specific requirements I need to consider? Yes. If you need to order connectivity from your premises, your provider needs to deliver the circuit to either Meet Me Room 1 or 2 (in SQ17 in our Corsham data centre and A9 in Farnborough). The provider also needs to deliver a fibre enabled router with LC connectors. You'll be set up with a 1G link as standard, however 10G is also available. Fibre runs between the data centres' Meet Me Rooms (MMRs) and the UKCloud suite will be protected using Kopex shielding. All connections are subject to available capacity. If my data centre is on the same campus as a UKCloud data centre, can I connect via direct fibre? Yes. NCSC recognises an intra-campus bonded fibre connection as being equivalent to CAS(T) and therefore appropriate for accessing the UKCloud Assured OFFICIAL cloud platform. CPA‑approved (or equivalent standard) overlay encryption should be used to make the fibre connection appropriate for accessing the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform. Fibre running between the data centres can be protected using Kopex shielding as an alternative. The cost of cabling between your data centre and our data centre is your responsibility, however we can help you arrange the installation with Ark. If my data centre is on the same campus as a UKCloud data centre, what type fibre do I need to order? If your data centre is in SQ17 Cosham or A9 Farnborough, then you need to place an order with Ark for multi-mode fibre with LC connectors. If your data centre is not in SQ17 or A9, single mode fibre needs to be installed with LC connectors. Ark will be able to supply both options. Can I install my own connectivity between UKCloud data centres? Yes. You can implement your own private circuit between our data centres, but it will be subject to costs, accreditation, configuration, support and lead times outside our control. We may charge you for hosting the private circuit equipment and for contributing to your design and implementation. Can I use UKCloud data centre interconnectivity (DCI) to 'triangulate' my private connectivity? Yes. You can deploy a private circuit into each data centre and use the UKCloud DCI to provide additional resilience. If the primary private circuit were to fail, you could get to the primary data centre (DC1) via the private circuit into the second data centre (DC2) and across the UKCloud DCI. In this case, you must use 'reserved bandwidth'. There may be setup costs (aligned to the SFIA rate card), depending on the complexity of the requirement. How will HybridConnect connect to my UKCloud environment? The way that HybridConnect connects to your UKCloud environment depends on the region in which your environment is located and what kind of virtual firewall technology you use. You can discuss your options with your Solution Architect. How do I initiate and process a HybridConnect installation? You need to either contact your account director or raise a service request via My Calls in the UKCloud Portal. How much do you charge for a HybridConnect connection? There is a one‑off charge of £2,000. General connectivity questions If you have questions about connectivity in general, please see the General connectivity FAQs .

    "keywords": "Cloud Storage Service Scope About this document This document describes the boundaries of the Cloud Storage service, along with the division of responsibilities between UKCloud and the customer, to facilitate the provisioning and ongoing use of the service. About Cloud Storage Cloud Storage from UKCloud is a secure and highly adaptable storage platform designed to address a wide variety of use cases. As an object storage platform based on Dell EMC's Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS), it is natively optimised for cloud storage in terms of scale, resilience and accessibility. Service options Organisations can choose from two service levels: STANDARD - data is stored in a single named UK-sovereign data centre with data protection using erasure coding. This provides fault tolerance by storing three copies of the data across separate nodes, thus improving data durability. ENHANCED - data is stored in two UK-sovereign data centres, with a copy maintained in a primary named UK data centre and copied to a geographically remote UK data centre. This provides a greater degree of fault tolerance than the STANDARD service level by storing an additional copy of the data in a separate site. If you want more control and visibility of your disaster recovery solution, you can design your solution to write data independently to each data centre at our STANDARD service level, instead of using our ENHANCED service level. Full details of the available service options are outlined in the Service Definition . Service availability UKCloud platform availability is based on the service level you purchase. The service level agreement (SLA) for the STANDARD service level guarantees 99.95% availability. The ENHANCED service level SLA guarantees 99.99% availability. In the event of a site failure, there will be an outage to objects created on the failed site. UKCloud will bring these objects online in the other site within 15 minutes. You are entitled to claim Service Credits for outages to services that take you out of SLA. For more about how we calculate SLAs, see the SLA Definition . Service background We actively capacity-manage the cloud platform to ensure you have access to the resources you request. The UKCloud platform is designed using sites, regions and zones. The relationship between them is shown below: You can specify Farnborough or Corsham as the site where you would like to have your service provisioned. We will try to accommodate requests and will advise you if we are unable do so. We control the deployed versions of technology on the platform. This covers internal platform-supporting technologies, and any technology versions available to you. Platform management Users can access, manage and view their Cloud Storage service, in any of the following ways: APIs. You can use either the ECS S3-compatible API or the ECS Atmos API. The APIs are not interchangeable, so you need to choose carefully which API you want to use. Refer to the EMC ECS Data Access Guide for more information on the features of both APIs. Command Line Interface (CLI). CLI tools enable access from the command line by translating commands into the relevant API calls. Storage Gateways. These applications can interact with Cloud Storage via the native API on the back-end and translate it into a more traditional file or block storage protocol at the front-end, enabling a wide variety of use cases. For more information see the appropriate Cloud Storage Gateways Knowledge Centre article: How to install the GeoDrive Client 2.0 How to install CloudArray UKCloud Portal. Contains information about the namespaces and users within your Cloud Storage environment, as well as a graphical representation of your storage consumption. For more information on the Portal functionality, see How to view Cloud Storage information in the UKCloud Portal . To create additional namespaces or users, you must raise a service request. When requesting additional users, you can specify whether you want these users to have read-write or read-only permissions. We do not currently offer access as an NFS or a HDFS. You cannot access the underlying infrastructure. This includes (but isn't limited to) the hardware and the ECS Portal. Protection You can protect against accidental deletion or modification of data by using retention policies or versioning. Retention policies add a layer of protection by preventing files from being modified or deleted for a specified period of time, making them best suited to static data. Retention policies cannot be applied at the object level -- these API requests will be rejected. Versioning can protect against accidental deletion and modification by keeping multiple variants of an object. When versioning is enabled, any operation that would have overwritten an object retains the old version of the object, enabling you to retrieve or restore to a previous version using the S3 API. Each version of an object will be billable for the storage it consumes, so you may want to implement versioning expiration policies to manage your storage footprint. Encryption at rest can be enabled when creating a new namespace or bucket. This encrypts data inline, using an AES 256-bit algorithm, before it is stored on drives. If you want your data to be encrypted at the namespace level, you must request this functionality before your namespace is created, as encryption cannot be enabled or disabled after a namespace is created. Networks Cloud Storage is available on a range of Assured and Elevated networks. An overview of the available networks in each region is available in UKCloud Services By Region . Cloud Storage in our Assured OFFICAL domain uses the same environment for both PSN Assured and internet connections. Although it isn't possible to bridge between these connections, any objects placed in Cloud Storage via PSN Assured will also be accessible via the internet using the appropriate customer credentials. We manage the physical firewalls that face public and secure networks. Protective monitoring We have implemented GPG 13-aligned Protective Monitoring across the Assured and Elevated platforms at the perimeter of your estate. We don't provide Protective Monitoring services within your estate - it is your responsibility to act at this level. In line with UKCloud's SISP, we provide notification of customer-impacting security incidents. It is your responsibility to report similar incidents to us. Service migration You can request a migration through a Service Request. Migrations may be between: Services (for example, STANDARD to ENHANCED) UKCloud sites or availability zones The Assured and Elevated platforms Customer service Customer Success Manager (CSM). For the first 90 days of the service, you have access to a UKCloud Customer Success Manager, who will help you with your adoption of the UKCloud Cloud Storage service, including finding relevant systems and using UKCloud tools and processes. Cloud Architects. UKCloud Cloud Architects support you during the design of solutions for the cloud platform. UKCloud Cloud Architects are ideally placed to help reconcile your requirements with the UKCloud platform. We recommend engagement with a Cloud Architect when implementing complex solutions. Technical Account Managers (TAM). You will be allocated with an assigned point of contact who will provide ongoing assistance with reporting and incident escalation. Support. After the initial on-boarding and design phase, you can utilise the standard UKCloud support entitlement, which is documented in the Customer Engagement Factsheet . Customer responsibilities Assessing whether the UKCloud platform can support the various requirements of your application and storage needs. The control and management of access and responsibilities for end users including appropriate connectivity, security and accreditation if required. If access is required over government secure networks (HSCN, Janet, RLI or PSN), the customer is responsible for adhering to the relevant Code of Connection (CoCo) and for providing evidence of their CoCo to UKCloud upon request. UKCloud is unable to provide access to secure networks where such evidence has not been provided by the customer. The customer is also responsible for ensuring only lawful data that supports the UK public sector is stored and processed by applications on this environment, and that they fully comply with the UKCloud Security Operating Procedures (SyOPs) and other information assurance requirements as specified in the UKCloud System Interconnect and Security Policy (SISP) and associated accreditation documentation sets. Service provisioning Within 1 day of accepting an order (shorter deployment times are typically achieved and can be prioritised upon request), UKCloud will create the customer's Primary Administrator account and send a Welcome Pack which includes the URL for the UKCloud Customer Portal, and the getting started guide. The customer can then use these details to configure their application (for example GeoDrive, Cloud Tiering Appliance and Documentum) or access Cloud Storage via the API to begin using the service. UKCloud has created a number of videos, help guides, manuals and FAQs to help train and instruct users so that they are up and running quickly and easily. These are available within the Knowledge Centre, accessed via the UKCloud Portal. UKCloud also has a large ecosystem of partners who can deliver additional services, such as support and professional services. UKCloud would be pleased to introduce you to the right partner to suit your needs. Service constraints UKCloud will adhere to the following in terms of maintenance windows: \"Planned Maintenance\" means any pre-planned disruptive maintenance to any of the infrastructure relating to the service. Planned Maintenance activity may result in periods of degradation or loss of availability depending on the nature of the activity required. In such cases, UKCloud shall provide affected customers with at least fourteen (14) days' notice of the Planned Maintenance. If during Planned Maintenance there is a loss of availability outside the scope described in the planned maintenance notification to the service, an SLA event will be triggered. \"Emergency Maintenance\" means any urgent maintenance required to prevent or mitigate against any event compromising the infrastructure relating to the service. Whenever possible, UKCloud shall: a) provide affected customers with at least six (6) hours' advance notice and b) carry out the emergency maintenance between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Friday or between the hours of Saturday 00:00 to 06:00 (UK local time) on Monday, (including bank holidays) unless there is an identified and demonstrable immediate risk to customer environment(s). Emergency Maintenance may result in periods of degradation or loss of availability depending on the nature of the activity required. If during Emergency Maintenance there is a loss of availability to the service, an SLA event will be triggered. This time will be excluded from the availability calculation but will be included in monthly service reporting related to the service.

    "title": "Getting Started Guide for Cloud Storage | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for Cloud Storage Introduction UKCloud's Cloud Storage service is an object storage solution based on Dell EMC Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS). Access is via a RESTful application programming interface (API), which also provides support for Amazon's S3 API. This Getting Started Guide covers the tasks you need to perform to get Cloud Storage up and running in your environment. It also looks at common use cases for API‑based object storage within web applications and provides information about some command-line tools that you can use to interact with the storage APIs. Intended audience This guide is intended for users who want to learn more about UKCloud's Cloud Storage service. Cloud Storage overview Cloud Storage: Is a secure and highly adaptable storage platform designed to address a wide variety of use cases Is based on object storage technology that is natively optimised for cloud storage in terms of scale, resilience and accessibility Removes the complexity of capacity management by utilising a pay‑as‑you‑go model, so you pay for what you use, when you use it, scaling indefinitely and on demand Natively enables application deduplication and redundancy to ensure the highest level of data availability, while reducing the cost and management of on-premises storage solutions Provides easy access to storage anywhere, any time, to any device, using HTTP(S) to simplify the integration of object storage systems into cloud‑based solutions by removing the need to rely on the availability of web, file or FTP servers Offloads objects (files, media, images) from compute resources, reducing the load on server resources Automatically replicates and distributes objects to give high levels of data durability and availability, eliminating the need for cloud backup and recovery ECS provides two APIs that you can use to manage your cloud storage: the S3‑compatible API and the EMC ECS Atmos API. Note If you write content to cloud storage using one of the APIs, you cannot subsequently access that content using the other API. Choose carefully which API you want to use before beginning a project, as it will be difficult to move between them. The key differences between the two APIs are: The ECS S3-compatible API enables you to easily migrate applications between Atmos, S3 and other S3‑compatible storage; but not all functionality available in S3 is available on ECS as shown in the S3 Supported Features chapter of the Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS) Data Access Guide ). The ECS Atmos API provides backward compatibility with the EMC Atmos platform. It offers access to the majority of the features of the platform with certain exceptions as listed in the Atmos Supported Features chapter of the Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS) Data Access Guide . Cloud Storage use cases The low cost of cloud storage per GB, as well as its almost unlimited scalability, means there's a large variety of use cases for it. For example, it's ideal for data archives, backups, log files, and media repositories. We anticipate that most web applications can make good use of cloud storage for static content, such as images and downloadable binaries. Storing these items in cloud storage—rather than in primary storage attached to web servers, inside the database or on a traditional file share—can provide significant benefits in terms of cost savings, agility and performance. For example, with an internet-facing application that enables users to download forms and guides in PDF, these items are often stored in primary storage attached to the web servers, which creates several challenges: Whenever a PDF is updated, the updated copy must be replicated to all web servers When an item is downloaded, the bandwidth usage of the web server in question increases Multiple simultaneous downloads could overload the web servers or other components of the network infrastructure Each object is stored multiple times in primary storage, increasing the overall cost of storage On the other hand, storing this content in cloud storage overcomes these challenges because: Only one copy of each item is stored, so updates only need to be made in one place End users connect directly to cloud storage to download PDFs, bypassing the web servers and associated network infrastructure Objects are stored only once, and at a much lower price per GB, which substantially reduces the overall cost of storage The same principles apply to other static content, such as images and (especially) videos. The more workload you can offload onto an external system such as cloud storage, the leaner your application infrastructure can become. There are often questions around how best to implement this. Ultimately, it's up to the application developers, but a popular approach is as follows: Handle content uploads and creation on the web servers. Perform any required modifications or transformations using on-demand processing servers (usually from a message queue). Write the content into cloud storage, storing the resulting object IDs, external URLs and any other relevant metadata in the application database. This process provides a relatively simple transition to cloud storage. The application still knows about all the objects, but rather than retrieving, for example, a relative path for an item from the database, its entire URL is retrieved, pointing to cloud storage. Before you begin When you request your Cloud Storage service, UKCloud Support creates a namespace in the specified account. If you have requested an Atmos subtenant, this is also created. To create S3 buckets, use any S3-compliant tool. To create additional namespaces or Atmos subtenants, you must raise a service request. You can have S3 buckets and Atmos subtentants in the same namespace. Cloud Storage provides different API endpoints to access your storage, depending on the UKCloud site and connectivity type you are using. Make sure you use the correct endpoint to ensure the best possible performance for your solution. S3 API endpoint Atmos API endpoint Corsham (Assured) Internet cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com atmos.cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com PSN Assured cas.cor00005.psnassured.ukcloud.com atmos.cas.cor00005.psnassured.ukcloud.com HSCN cas.cor00005.ukcloud.thirdparty.nhs.uk/ atmos.cas.cor00005.ukcloud.thirdparty.nhs.uk/ Farnborough (Assured) Internet cas.frn00006.ukcloud.com atmos.cas.frn00006.ukcloud.com PSN Assured cas.frn00006.psnassured.ukcloud.com atmos.cas.frn00006.psnassured.ukcloud.com HSCN cas.frn00006.ukcloud.thirdparty.nhs.uk/ atmos.cas.frn00006.ukcloud.thirdparty.nhs.uk/ Contact UKCloud support if you are unsure which endpoint to use. Using the ECS S3-compatible API The S3-compatible API is at: https://<api_endpoint> Check which api_endpoint to use in Before you begin , for example: https://cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com To help get you started, you can find developer resources on the Amazon web site at: https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/s3/ For details of the supported and unsupported S3 operations on ECS, see: https://www.emc.com/techpubs/ecs/ecs_s3_supported_features-1.htm You may also find the Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS) Data Access Guide useful: https://www.emc.com/collateral/TechnicalDocument/docu79368.pdf Note Currently the HSCN DNS service does not allow UKCloud to create wildcard DNS entries for our services. This means that S3 URLs that feature the bucket as part of the domain do not work (for example, bucket01.cas.frn00006.ukcloud.thirdparty.nhs.uk ). With most S3 tools, you can choose whether to use prefix buckets or suffix buckets. If you are using the service via HSCN you'll need to make sure your client tools support suffix buckets. Amazon S3 Authentication Tool for Curl The Amazon S3 Authentication Tool for Curl (S3Curl) is a very useful Perl script, developed by Amazon. It's a wrapper for Curl that calculates the required authentication signature automatically for each request. As the authentication signature changes for every request, this allows Curl to interact with the API outside of code, enabling you to validate that your commands are working correctly and view the raw HTML response from the API, which can be useful when troubleshooting. For more information about S3Curl, see http://aws.amazon.com/code/128 . To use S3Curl: Download S3Curl from the following location: https://github.com/UKCloud/s3curl Install the following required dependency: sudo apt-get install libdigest-hmac-perl yum install perl-Digest-HMAC Create a file named .s3curl in the home directory containing your credentials. For example: %awsSecretAccessKeys = ( UKCloud => { id => '<user_id>', key => '<secret_key>', }, ); Where: user_id is your User ID (you can find this in the Storage section of the UKCloud Portal) secret_key is your secret key (If you've forgotten or don't know your secret key, you can reset it in the Storage section of the UKCloud Portal) Change the permissions, otherwise the Perl script will refuse to run. chmod 600 .s3curl Make the following small modification to the script itself so that it will work correctly with ECS: Open the s3curl.pl file in your preferred editor (for example, vim or nano). Scroll down until you find the following comment: # begin customizing here The S3 endpoints are defined below this line, so add your Cloud Storage host name to this list as follows: my @endpoints = ('<api_endpoint>', 's3.amazonaws.com', ... For example: #begin customizing here my @endpoints = ('cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com', 's3.amazonaws.com', ... Save the file. S3Curl is now ready to use, so you can call it as follows: perl s3curl.pl --id UKCloud -- <curl_arguments> The curl_arguments need to contain the host name and port number. For example, to list your buckets, you could use: perl s3curl.pl --id UKCloud -- https://cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com/ Or to delete a file named Lighthouse.jpg in /bucket2 : perl s3curl.pl --id UKCloud -- -X DELETE https://cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com/bucket2/Lighthouse.jpg Using the ECS Atmos API The Atmos API is at: https://<api_endpoint> Check which api_endpoint to use in Before you begin , for example: https://atmos.cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com To help get you started, download the appropriate Atmos SDK from the following location: https://community.emc.com/docs/DOC-27910 The SDK provides bindings for all popular languages, as well as some quick start guides. You can find the full API reference in the EMC Atmos Programmer's Guide , which you can download from the following location (or the UKCloud Knowledge Centre): https://www.emc.com/collateral/TechnicalDocument/docu68370.pdf For details of the supported and unsupported Atmos operations on ECS, see: https://www.emc.com/techpubs/ecs/ecs_atmos_supported_features-1.htm You may also find the Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS) Data Access Guide useful: https://www.emc.com/collateral/TechnicalDocument/docu79368.pdf Using a command-line interface Interacting with Cloud Storage via the API directly is ideal for web-based applications, but having access from the command line can help developers with testing and provide scripting access to Cloud Storage. Command‑line interface (CLI) tools enable access from the command line by translating commands into the relevant API calls. There are lots of CLI tools to choose from --- this guide examines two for the S3 API: one each for Linux and Windows. Remember that the APIs are not interchangeable, so if you use the Atmos API in your application, you won't be able to see the data using the S3 CLI. Using S3cmd --- a Linux CLI for the S3 API S3cmd is an open-source tool for Linux, written in Python. To use S3cmd: Download and extract the S3cmd files from the following location: http://s3tools.org/download Create the required configuration files by running the following command: s3cmd ---configure When prompted, provide the following information: Access Key --- your User ID (you can find this in the Storage section of the UKCloud Portal) Secret Key --- your secret key (If you've forgotten or don't know your secret key, you can reset it in the Storage section of the UKCloud Portal) Encryption password --- create a secure password Path to GPG program --- as appropriate for your system Use HTTPS protocol --- Yes You'll be prompted to test the connection. After the test, even if it fails, save the configuration, which will be written to ~/.s3cfg . Edit the ~/.s3cfg file and confirm that the host_base and host_bucket lines look like the following: host_base = <api_endpoint> host_bucket = %(bucket)s.<api_endpoint> Note Ensure that you use the appropriate api_endpoint , as shown in Before you begin , for example: host_base = cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com host_bucket = %(bucket)s.cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com Save the file.

    "title": "Getting Started Guide for the Cross Domain Security Zone Walled Garden | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for the Cross Domain Security Zone Walled Garden Overview The UKCloud Walled Garden provides self-service access to the Cross Domain Security Zone (CDSZ) so that you can design, implement and manage your own cross‑domain solution, using technology and application services of your choice. UKCloud provides an assurance wrap by managing firewalls between the security domains and ensuring you use appropriate risk management to understand and mitigate identified risks. The Walled Garden is ideal if you require more control and flexibility over what is passed between security domains, to support a wider range of use cases. This guide covers the steps you need to follow to get your Walled Garden up and running. Intended audience This guide is intended for customers who have: Completed the CDSZ Walled Garden assurance wrap Been approved to have a Base Implementation of the Walled Garden to allow data to pass between the Assured and Elevated security domains on the UKCloud platform Before you begin Before you can start to implement a walled garden, you must have completed and passed the appropriate application process. For more information, see the UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone application process . After your Walled Garden application has been approved, a service request is raised to implement the Walled Garden virtual data centre (VDC) and, if necessary, Elevated and Assured VDCs. Note If a service request for this implementation already exists, the existing request is used and a new one is not raised. You can track the progress of the service request in the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. During the provisioning of the Walled Garden service, we'll ask you for some additional information via the service request: The customer account in which you would like the Walled Garden VDC to be provisioned, if different from the customer completing the Walled Garden application. Whether you plan to have a single or dual site solution. How many VDCs you need to be set up in each security domain. If you're connecting new or existing VDCs to the Walled Garden VDC. If you're connecting to existing VDCs, we'll need to know information such as NFT details, customer account, and so on. The external source IP addresses from which you'd like to access the Assured VDC (up to a maximum of 50). These IP addresses are the locations from which you can build and test the environment (for example, offices or end user premises). The build phase of the Walled Garden environment can take up to 10 working days depending on the complexity of the deployment. When the environment has been fully provisioned, your Customer Success Manager (CSM) will send you the information you need to access it. Building your Walled Garden service As soon as you have access to your environment, you can start to build your Walled Garden services. It is important to remember that while the UKCloud Portal for the Assured security domain is accessible from the internet, the Portal for the Elevated security domain and Walled Garden services is accessible only through the PSN Protected network or through UKCloud's Secure Remote Access (SRA) service. Setting up your networking First, you need to replicate the networking that you set out in your Walled Garden application diagrams. This involves the creation of external and internal networking, as well as the creation of rules on the virtual firewall within your environment. For information about creating networks and firewall rules, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware and How to build a virtual machine with UKCloud for VMware . You also need to create the rules that allow connectivity between the different VDCs through the Walled Garden. This involves the creation of firewall rules, static routes and/or NAT rules. Networking examples There are two options for networking between the VDCs in the Walled Garden service: Option 1: Create static routes between the VDCs; this is the simplest option for connecting VDCs Option 2: Use NAT rules on top of the static routes; this option may be appropriate if you want to abstract the static routes The diagrams below provide examples for both options. Note For both options: You cannot route public IP addresses to the vCNS Edges in the Walled Garden The Org VDC networks 192.168.XXX.XX in the examples below are illustrative and you should replace these with your own details You must have one VM in the Walled Garden VDC connecting to both vCNS Edges Each of the examples below assumes that the appropriate firewall rules are in place You must apply an SNAT rule in the Elevated security domain to enable connectivity to UKCloud services Building your virtual machines The next step is to build the VMs that you outlined in the Walled Garden application. This involves deploying the VMs from either the vCloud Director catalog or from template VMs as OVF files. The VMs must be able to access UKCloud services, such as OS repositories, the network time server, the Key Management Server (KMS), and so on. You may also need to access external services, such as antivirus repositories. You must configure this access in your VDC networking. For more information about creating VMs and accessing UKCloud services, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware . Testing your environment When you've built your VMs and networking, you can start to test the environment. If you've configured the networking correctly, your VMs should be able to talk to each other across the Walled Garden. If you have any issues, check your network rules. Performing the IT Health Check As part of the CDSZ application process, you're required to outline any IT Health Check (ITHC) you intend to perform on the environment. The ITHC should be conducted by an independent CHECK Service Provider, approved and classified as Green Light by the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). You can search for appropriate providers on the NCSC web site . Before beginning the ITHC, notify UKCloud by raising a service request in My Calls and completing the External Security Review Test (ESRT) application form . Ideally, we require five working days' notice before the work is due to be carried out. The ITHC scope should be relevant to the environment. For example, if you're using the Walled Garden to pull application and antivirus updates from the internet, then security controls relevant to facilitate this should be in scope. Bear in mind that the end customer accreditor may dictate the scope of the ITHC.

    "title": "How to use the Azure Stack API | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to use the Azure Stack API Overview The Azure Stack API enables you to interact programmatically with your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure environment. For example, you can use API calls to manage your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure tenancy. This guide shows you how to get started with the Azure Stack API. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have the appropriate permissions on the resource you are trying to access. Authenticating to the API Azure Stack API authentication uses access tokens to validate requests. To obtain an access token: Send a POST request to the Azure REST authentication/login endpoint: https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant_id>/oauth2/token where tenant_id is one of: Your tenant domain, for example, ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com , ukcloud.com , example.mydomain.com Your tenant ID, for example 8eaef023-2b34-4da1-9baa-8bc8c9d6a490 The default value for tenant independent keys: common Pass the following parameters in the request body: grant_type - The type of authentication scheme to use: password client_id - Hard-coded to a default value of 1950a258-227b-4e31-a9cf-717495945fc2 Other options for specific scenarios are: LegacyPowerShell - 0a7bdc5c-7b57-40be-9939-d4c5fc7cd417* PowerShell - 1950a258-227b-4e31-a9cf-717495945fc2 WindowsAzureActiveDirectory - 00000002-0000-0000-c000-000000000000 VisualStudio - 872cd9fa-d31f-45e0-9eab-6e460a02d1f1 AzureCLI - 04b07795-8ddb-461a-bbee-02f9e1bf7b46 resource - The endpoint of the resource the token will be used to access, for example, https://management.ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com/4de154de-a8a8-4017-af41-df619da68154 You can obtain the resource endpoint by querying the Azure Stack management metadata endpoint. The resource endpoint is returned in the audiences section of the response. For example, to find the endpoint for the operators resource send a request to https://adminmanagement.<region>.<AzureStackdomain>/metadata/endpoints?api-version=2015-01-01 username - The Azure Stack AAD account, for example azurestackadmin@ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com password - The password for the Azure Stack AAD account scope - optional, such as openid to get the ID token For example: grant_type=password &client_id=1950a258-227b-4e31-a9cf-717495945fc2 &resource=(endpoint returned in the audiences section below) &username=admin@ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com &password=Password123 &scope=openid Note Format the request body using the Content-Type x-www-form-urlencoded . An example request might look something like the following curl -X \"POST\" \"https://login.windows.net/160f539f-8571-4c96-9361-797645c24e75/oauth2/token\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\ --data-urlencode \"client_id=1950a258-227b-4e31-a9cf-717495945fc2\" \\ --data-urlencode \"grant_type=password\" \\ --data-urlencode \"username=admin@ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com\" \\ --data-urlencode 'password=Password12345' \\ --data-urlencode \"resource=https://management.ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com/c0a3a144-57ae-42e2-a5da-19e945a25deb\" If the authentication is successful, the endpoint returns an access token. For example: { \"token_type\": \"Bearer\", \"scope\": \"user_impersonation\", \"expires_in\": \"3599\", \"ext_expires_in\": \"0\", \"expires_on\": \"1512574780\", \"not_before\": \"1512570880\", \"resource\": \"https://management.ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com/c0a3a144-57ae-42e2-a5da-19e945a25deb\", \"access_token\": \"eyJ0eXAiOi...truncated for readability...\" } You must include this token in the Authorization header of each subsequent API request. For example: curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOi...truncated for readability...\" 'https://management.local.azurestack.external/subscriptions?api-version=2016-05-01' Calling Azure Stack API endpoints A REST request URI consists of: <URI-scheme>://<URI-host>/<resource-path>?<query-string> where: URI-scheme is the protocol used to transmit the request, for example http or https . URI-host is the domain name or IP address of the server where the REST service endpoint is hosted, for example management.local.azurestack.external . resource-path is the resource or resource collection, which may include multiple segments, used by the service in determining the selection of those resources. For example beta/applications/00003f25-7e1f-4278-9488-efc7bac53c4a/owners is the resource path to a specific application's owners within the applications collection. query-string provides additional simple parameters, such as the API version or resource selection criteria. The syntax of an Azure Stack request URI is: https://management.local.azurestack.external/<subscription-id>/resourcegroups/<resource-group>/providers/<provider>/<resource-path>?<filter-expression>&api-version=<api-version> where: subscription-id is your tenant subscription ID resource-group is the resource group you want to query provider is the provider you want to query resource-path is the resource you want to query filter-expression is an optional list of arguments to filter the results of the query api-version is the version of the Azure Stack API being called, for example api-version=2016-05-01 For example, the following API call returns information about region health: https://management.local.azurestack.external/subscriptions/800c4168-3eb1-405b-a4ca-919fe7ee42e9/resourcegroups/system.local/providers/microsoft.infrastructureinsights.admin/regionhealths/local/Alerts?$filter=(Properties/State eq 'Active') and (Properties/Severity eq 'Critical')&$orderby=Properties/CreatedTimestamp desc&api-version=2016-05-01\" Next steps For general information about the Azure API, see the Azure REST API Reference at: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/rest/api/?view=Azure In particular, you may find the following documents useful: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-rest-api-use https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-protocols-oauth-code https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-authentication-scenarios https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-protocols-oauth-code https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/master/articles/azure-stack/azure-stack-provider-resource-api.md There is not currently an API reference guide for Azure Stack Users; however, there is an Admin API guide that you can find here .

It is not fit for production workloads and has some subtle differences vs the real Azure Stack integrate appliance, however for most test scenarios it will suffice. The ASDK is used in two modes within UKCloud: Physical hardware (pre-production) - Community support with Microsoft Virtual servers (development and testing) - not officially supported by Microsoft This document covers two scenarios, building from scratch and redeploying. Step 1 - Hardware pre-requisites Detailed specifications are here - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-deploy Device Details CPU >=16 cores RAM >=128GB OS Disks >=200GB Data Disks >=4 * >=250G Virtualisation Note: VMware HW must be >=11, CPU virtual extension pass-through must be enabled Important If you deploy your VM with Hardware Version 11 and Operating System Family as Windows Server 2016 you will not be able to create S2D Cluster as disk UUIDs are not exposed. Either create it with Windows Server 2012 and change later or in Configuration Parameters -> Click Add Row. In the Name column, enter disk.EnableUUID. In the Value column, enter TRUE. This will show correct disk IDs in Get-PhysicalDisk cmdlets and cluster should build.

    "title": "Protection for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Protection for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks Overview UKCloud services are designed to support and enable the government digital strategy and so we host citizen facing solutions for a number of government departments. Some of these high-profile solutions inevitably attract undesirable attention from malicious actors. Unfortunately, if these malicious actors launch a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)^ attack of sufficient size, it is possible to overwhelm the capacity of the UKCloud internet connections and affect the ability for users to access other internet facing systems (including those not specifically targeted by the attack). UKCloud has enhanced the solutions used to protect the underlying internet-facing infrastructure used by all customers. To this end, UKCloud are focusing on mitigating broad, high-volume attacks, which are most likely to cause collateral damage and noisy neighbour characteristics. These enhancements do not provide adequate mitigation for low-level application-specific attacks or advanced persistent threats and these should be dealt with by customer-specific and customer-managed mitigation solutions. UKCloud customers can procure these customer-specific solutions via UKCloud's Digital Marketplace services (for more information, see the Application-tuned DDoS protection Service Scope ). ^ Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is a specific type of attack designed to cause the target system to become unavailable. Specifically, this type of attack is highly distributed as the attack traffic comes from a diverse global network of attackers. This is similar to the analogy 'death by a thousand daggers'. Options considered UKCloud evaluated the following three options to provide protection for DDoS attacks: Option 1 - Build our own DDoS mitigation solution This option would entail UKCloud increasing the capacity of the platform by upgrading our ISP connections and it would require the procurement, implementation and on-going management of specialist DDoS mitigation products (for example, Arbor or Radware), which would incur significant up-front and on-going costs. Most importantly, as DDoS attacks are increasing in size and frequency, as well as attack vectors forever changing, it is clear that a sub-scale option like this would not provide effective mitigation in the long term. Option 2 - Procure DDoS detection and mitigation services from our upstream ISPs UKCloud has confirmed that each of our upstream ISPs can provide a level of DDoS mitigation within their networks. These ISPs each have up to 100 Gb network capacity, which makes it less likely that they would be overwhelmed by a typical DDoS attack. However, their solutions are typically based on technologies from individual DDoS mitigation product vendors (typically Arbor) and so they can only provide generalised and automated DDoS protection services. Further, these solutions are only effective within the ISP network and each ISP works independently of each another, so UKCloud would have to procure the service from each ISP individually and co-ordinate them in the event of an attack. Option 3 - Leverage a specialist DDoS mitigation service There are a number of specialist DDoS mitigation service providers such as Akamai (previously Prolexic), Black Lotus (now part of Level3), Neustar and Verisign. Each service provider has created a global network of scrubbing centres which operate at terabit (1000 Gb+) scale. The scrubbing centres use multiple DDoS mitigation techniques (both commercial and proprietary), which ensures they are even able to mitigate attacks that are designed to exploit weaknesses in individual DDoS mitigation products (such as Arbor). Their terabit scale also ensures that they can mitigate even the largest 100 Gb+ attacks, which could overwhelm ISP solutions. Therefore, it is not surprising that these services are used by most major retailers, financial institutions and service providers. On the other hand, these specialist services are typically more expensive to buy than any other option. Chosen implementation Having carefully considered the options, UKCloud: Discounted option 1 because it is sub-scale and likely to be ineffectual against larger DDoS attacks and more complex DDoS attacks. Discounted option 2 because the effectiveness of the DDoS mitigation varies across ISPs which places a higher burden on UKCloud operational teams and a lower consistency of service to our customers. Focused on option 3 as these specialist services provide a more consistent and deterministic service (regardless of the route traffic takes into the platform), more effective DDoS mitigation and protection and superior incident reporting, enabling UKCloud to provide our customers with the details they need when reporting to GovCERT. UKCloud has selected one of the leading global providers of DDoS mitigation services, which provides specialist DDoS mitigation capabilities to the largest online organisations worldwide. The service includes an array of DDoS mitigation technologies and specialist security analysts who operate a 24x7 security operations centre. This enables DDoS attacks to be detected and mitigated typically within five minutes. UKCloud has performed extensive testing of the DDoS mitigation service, which has helped identify a number of customer-affecting issues that we had not anticipated. Based on the learning from this evaluation period, we've adjusted our design to incorporate a hybrid of option 1 (local DDoS mitigation appliances), which automatically signal and involve option 3 (cloud based DDoS mitigation) as appropriate. This solution has now been implemented on the UKCloud platform. If your system is the target for a DDoS attack, UKCloud will notify you individually and work with you to provide the necessary information about the attack to submit into CERT-UK and GovCERT. How it works UKCloud uses the internet standard BGP (border gateway protocol) to advertise preferred routes for our entire public IP address space to travel directly into our cloud platform via our multiple Tier 1 ISP connections. This ensures that all inbound traffic destined to workloads hosted on the UKCloud platform has a direct route into our platform and is not subjected to increased latency or additional network hops. Our Tier 1 ISPs pass traffic directly into specialist DDoS mitigation appliances (Arbor), which are hosted within each of UKCloud's data centres. Our local DDoS mitigation appliances are operated by our DDoS mitigation partner and so benefit from specialist 24x7 monitoring and management. All inbound traffic is inspected by the DDoS mitigation appliances, providing a first line of countermeasures and automatically signalling our DDoS mitigation partner. This configuration enables the DDoS mitigation partner to automatically and immediately detect when an attack is being mounted and implement appropriate countermeasures, including redirecting traffic through their terabit-scale scrubbing centres, as appropriate. These solutions typically begin mitigating DDoS attacks within five to ten minutes. All inbound traffic is routed directly to UKCloud-hosted DDoS mitigation appliances via BGP. The UKCloud DDoS mitigation appliances automatically alert our DDoS mitigation partner who have specialist engineers, processes and additional DDoS-mitigation technology to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks. Under attack conditions, traffic is re-routed via terabit-scale DDoS scrubbing centres. Workloads on the UKCloud platform are protected from DDoS traffic. They only receive clean traffic and so the impact of the DDoS attack is contained. DDoS attacks can be extremely sophisticated in nature and there may be a dependency for the DDoS solution to be tuned based on the type and volume of the attack. This tuning process can be performed only during the attack and while the attack type is identified. In some cases, this may require customer co-operation and assistance. Risks and considerations UKCloud would like to emphasise that the protection that has been implemented is designed to defend the community of our customers rather than any individual customer. We are able to mitigate volumetric network level DDoS attacks that not only affect the target solution, but many other internet-connected solutions too (this is sometimes referred to as noisy neighbour or collateral damage). Hence, during a sustained volumetric attack, the solution is designed to provide cleansing to ensure legitimate users can continue to access the application or service. The solution is not designed to provide a comprehensive security solution for a specific application or service. This is important to understand because if your application or service needs to remain available regardless of the size of the DDoS attack then an additional, application-tuned DDoS service will be required. Further, it should be noted that volumetric DDoS attacks are often used as a smokescreen for more targeted low-and-slow attacks and advanced persistent threats (APT) that exploit application vulnerabilities higher up the stack (for example, Layer 7 exploits such as cross-site scripting). UKCloud recommends that customers consider mitigating these application specific threat vectors via appropriate solutions such as Web Application Firewalls, Content Delivery Networks, robust domain name services, on so on. UKCloud customers can procure an application-tuned DNS based DDoS mitigation solution via UKCloud's Digital Marketplace services (for more information, see the Application-tuned DDoS protection Service Scope ).

    "keywords": "DDoS mitigation causing VPN failures and slow applications Overview UKCloud utilises a hybrid solution Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) mitigation service to help protect customers against DDoS attacks. The hybrid service comprises local DDoS mitigation appliances to mitigate smaller attacks, failing over to the cloud if attacks exceed local capacity. For more information on this specific service, see DDoS mitigation service FAQ . Issue Although DDoS mitigation is a valuable service, there are some considerations to be aware of that could impact your environment if not accounted for, for example by causing VPN failures or slow applications. These may not be apparent in normal local operation of the DDoS service, but only come to light when larger attacks are mitigated via the cloud. This is because during cloud mitigation traffic is tunnelled, adding IP overhead. This could potentially cause packet fragmentation, resulting in the issues mentioned above. Recommendation We recommend that, as a proactive measure, you adjust the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) settings of your IPsec VPN connection from the default (~1500) to a fixed value between 1350 and 1400. You can do this using the vCloud Director GUI or by using the vCloud Director API (for more information, see How to configure IPsec VPN (GUI) or How to change IPSEC VPN settings via the vCloud Director API ). If you are still experiencing connection issues, raise a support request via the UKCloud Portal. Explanation MTU is the maximum size of data that can be sent in a single frame. It is typically set at the data link layer by the Ethernet protocol. Most devices have a default MTU size of 1500 bytes. IP facilitates delivery across networks using IP datagrams (which encapsulate the TCP or UDP message). IP datagrams can accommodate different MTU sizes, for example, by fragmenting a datagram that is larger than the MTU into smaller packages that can then be forwarded. However, some applications may set a DF (Do not Fragment) bit, meaning that the datagram cannot be fragmented. If these packets are larger than the MTU, they are dropped. Normally, traffic to UKCloud comes directly and is unlikely to be fragmented. However, if DDoS cloud mitigation is initiated, traffic is tunnelled to UKCloud from our DDoS provider. The tunnel adds an overhead to the IP packet, meaning that the packet could become greater than the MTU and need to be fragmented. Fragmented packets add extra overhead and can cause delay as they need to be broken up and reassembled. Also, if just one packet of the fragmented datagram is lost, the entire datagram must be retransmitted. In addition, for applications that have the DF bit set, packets that exceed the MTU will be dropped. Feedback If you find an issue with this article, click Improve this Doc to suggest a change.

    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for Email and Collaboration as a Service Overview UKCloud offers an Email and Collaboration service, powered by Zimbra, to enable you to have a cloud hosted, secure email service, connected to government networks or the internet. You can connect this mail service through your normal mail applications (for example, Microsoft Outlook), to send and receive mail as well as use lightweight collaborative features. This Getting Started Guide walks you through the process of configuring your Email and Collaboration service. Intended audience This guide is intended for users who want to set up their Email and Collaboration as a Service. To complete the steps in this guide you must have login credentials for an administrator account and access to the Zimbra administration console. Introduction to Email and Collaboration as a Service The Zimbra Collaboration Suite that underpins UKCloud's email offering provides a wide range of client connectivity options. An advanced webmail client allows the full feature set within the suite to be accessed from anywhere that internet connectivity is available and from virtually any platform via a wide-range of supported browsers A cross-platform desktop application is provided extending the functionality of the web client by enabling email to be read and composed while offline IMAP and POP3 clients are supported Calendar and contacts can be accessed via the CalDav and CardDav protocols Full Microsoft Outlook integration is supported using the Zimbra Collaboration Suite Connector for Outlook, which utilizes a full MAPI provider that leverages the Microsoft-standard MAPI interface for contacts, calendar, and other functionality not supported by IMAP or POP The service provides enterprise-class functionality for end-users, on a per-mailbox, per- month pricing model. It offers several options for mailbox access, including POP3, IMAP4 and SMTP --- all with TLS (SSL) encryption --- as well as HTTPS. Exchange ActiveSync is also supported. Although the service was designed with end-users in mind, there's nothing to stop you using the supported protocols to allow an application to access a mailbox in order to send or receive email. This will generally be achieved via SMTP or POP3 over TLS. It's worth noting that there's a minimum commitment of 25 mailboxes with this service --- but they don't all have to be used. Before you begin To start using the Email and Collaboration service, you first need to decide on a domain name, which must be a real-world, registered domain name. You can use a new domain name, or simply delegate a sub-domain of your organisation's existing domain name. You'll need to configure your chosen domain's MX record as mail.skyscapecs.net . Once you've decided on a domain name and submitted your service request, UKCloud will configure your domain name on our platform and create an administrator account. You'll receive a welcome email with details of your administrator account with delegated rights for your email domain. This account will usually be in the following format: admin@<yourdomain> For example: admin@example.com You'll receive the account details as part of the onboarding process; we recommend that you change the account's password immediately. This is the account you'll use to create mailboxes on the platform. You'll need to create a mailbox for each email address you want to be able to send or receive from. Supported browsers Refer to the Zimbra Collaboration Supported Systems document for the most up to date list, at: https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/8.7.0/Supported_Systems Firefox and Chrome on Windows, Mac, Linux Internet Explorer on Windows Safari on Mac and Windows Accessing the Zimbra administration console The Zimbra administration console is a browser-based user interface for managing your mailbox server and mailbox accounts. The way you access the administration console depends on which security domain you use: The Assured OFFICIAL console is accessible from the internet or via the PSN Assured network (depending on the service selected) The Elevated OFFICIAL console is accessible only via the PSN Protected network (and other interconnecting networks) We'll provide you with the URL for the administration console along with your account details. Creating a user account Creating a user account sets up the appropriate entries in the LDAP directory server. When the user logs in for the first time, or when the first email is delivered to the user's account, the mailbox is created on the mailbox server. To create a user account: In the administration console, select Manage and then Accounts . Click the gear symbol in the top-right of the main panel and select New . Enter an Account name and the user's Last name (the other fields are optional). If the new account will be an administrator, select the Administrator checkbox in the Account Setup section. Scroll down to set the initial Password then click Next . Enter the new user's contact information then click Next . Enter any aliases required for the account then click Next . Add the account to any required distribution lists then click Next . If the account is an administrator account, you need to add it to the administration group at this point, to grant the necessary rights within the domain. To do this: In the Find field under Add distribution lists to the account , enter admingroup and click Search . Select the resulting admingroup@<yourdomain> , for example admingroup@example.com . Click Add at the bottom of the dialog box to make the new account a member of the group. Specify any forwarding rules. Click Finish to complete creation of the account. The user can log in to and use the account immediately. It will take up to an hour to add the account to the Global Address List, during which time the account name won't be listed as an auto-complete option for users composing emails. Getting to know the Zimbra web client Zimbra offers standard HTML, advanced JavaScript, and mobile web clients that you can log into. The web clients include mail, calendar, address book, and task functionality. You can select the client to use when you log in. The advanced web client includes Ajax capability and offers a full set of web collaboration features. This web client works best with newer browsers and fast internet connections. The standard web client is a good option when internet connections are slow or if you prefer HTML-based messaging for navigating within your mailbox. The mobile web client provides an experience optimized for smaller screen formats available on mobile devices. Typically when you log in, you'll see the advanced Zimbra web client. You can switch to a different version if you prefer by using the Version list on the login screen. If the Zimbra web client detects that the screen resolution is 800x600, you're automatically redirected to the standard web client. You can still select the advanced web client but will see a warning message suggesting the use of the standard client for a better screen view. When connecting to Zimbra using a mobile web browser, Zimbra will automatically detect and default to the mobile web client. To access the Zimbra web client: Go to the following location: https://mail.skyscapecs.net/ Log in using your account's email address and password. Installing the Zimbra desktop client The Zimbra desktop client delivers a consistent user experience offline, so email, social media, calendar, contacts, files and documents are synchronized and locally accessible when on the road.

This can be referred to as an electronic mailshot. IMAP The Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is a mail protocol used for accessing email on a remote web server from a local client. LDAP Lightweight Directory Access Protocol is an Internet protocol that email and other programs use to look up information from a server. LDAP is mostly used by medium-to-large organisations. POP POP stands for Post Office Protocol. POP3 is version 3 of the protocol. When an e-mail is sent to your address, it is stored on the mail server until it is downloaded via your e-mail client (Outlook, your mobile, etc.) using POP3. After the e-mail has been downloaded to your client, it is removed from the server altogether. SMTP Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. SMTP is used when email is delivered from an email client, such as Outlook Express, to an email server or when email is delivered from one email server to another. SMTP uses port 25.

    "title": "How to create a catalog | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to create a catalog Overview UKCloud provides a public catalog for you to use that contains standard virtual machine (VM) sizes and operating systems. The public catalog is a good place to start when you first deploy VMs into the UKCloud platform. However, you may want to create your own catalogues, containing specific applications or gold images, which you can then use to deploy VMs quickly. Creating a catalog The first step is to create an empty catalog: Using vCloud Director 8.20 Using vCloud Director 9.1 In vCloud Director, select the Catalogs tab. Click the + button to add a new catalog. Name the catalog and give it a description if needed. There's also an option to add a Subscribed Catalog, a read-only copy of an externally published catalog. If you want to do this, you'll need to know the URL, and the password if there is one. When you're done, click Next . You now have the option to select the storage type used to store the catalog. The default is Use any storage . Leave this selected if you don't need to store catalog items on specific storage. Alternatively, you can indicate where your catalog items should be stored if they need to be stored on a specific storage policy. When you're done, click Next . To make the catalog visible to others, add specific people or your entire organisation. Click the Add Members button to add everyone in the organisation or individual users. You can give individuals different access levels. When you've added all the people who can access the catalog, click OK , then review each individual's access level and adjust it if needed. When you're done, click Next . You now have the choice to publish your catalog for the use of external organisations. To enable external publishing, select the checkbox and add a password if needed. If you don't want to share your catalog externally, just click Next . Review the settings and click Finish . In vCloud Director, click the menu icon and select Libraries . In the left navigation panel, click Catalogs . Click the Add button to create a new catalog. In the Create Catalog dialog box, Name the catalog and give it a Description if needed. From the Storage Policy list, select the storage type used to store the catalog. Tier1 is for high performance, high IOPS VMs Tier2 is for everything else less demanding (recommended for ISO and templates) When you're done, click OK . To make the catalog visible to others within your organisation, click the three vertical dots and select Share . In the Share Catalog dialog box, click the Add button. In the Share With Users and Groups dialog box, select: Share with everyone in the organisation to add everyone in the organisation Share with specific users or groups to add individual users or groups of users You can give users different access levels: Ready Only , Full Control or Change . Change allows users to change permissions. When you've added all the people who you want to access the catalog, click OK . When you're done, click OK . Populating a catalog There are two ways to populate a catalog: By uploading an OVF package By creating a template from an existing vApp Uploading an OVF package To upload an OVF package and assign it to a catalog: Using vCloud Director 8.20 Using vCloud Director 9.1 On the Catalogs tab, select the vApp Templates tab. Click the Upload button to open an OVF upload window. In the Upload OVF package as a vApp Template dialog box, select the source of the OVF: either a URL or a Local file . Give a destination for the OVF, and give the OVF a name. From the Catalog list, select the catalog you want to put the OVF in. When you're done, click Upload to import the OVF into the catalog. Depending on template size and network speed, the upload may take some time. In the Libraries pages, in the left navigation panel, select vApp Templates . Click the Add button to open an OVF upload window. In the Create vApp template from OVF dialog box, browse for the source of the OVF, then click Next . Tip You can select multiple files by pressing the CTRL key and selecting other files. Review the details of the OVF template and then click Next . Enter a Name and Description for the template and from the Catalog list, select the catalog in which you want to put the OVF. Click Next to continue. Review the details of the vApp template and when you're done, click Finish to deploy. Depending on template size and network speed, the upload may take some time. Adding an existing vApp To create a catalog from an existing vApp: Using vCloud Director 8.20 Using vCloud Director 9.1 In vCloud Director, select the My Cloud tab. Right-click the vApp you want to add to the catalog and select Add to Catalog . You can add both running and stopped vApps to the catalog, although it's worth noting that creating a catalog image from a running vApp could affect performance. You can now choose the catalog you want to add the vApp to, give the vApp a new name, assign a storage lease, and define whether vApps deployed using this template are identical or customisable. You can also overwrite an existing catalog item. If the catalog you are adding the vApp to is published externally, you'll see a warning. When you're done, click OK . In vCloud Director, click the menu icon and select Datacenters . Select the VDC where the vApp is located. In the left navigation panel, click vApps . In the card for the vApp that you want to add to the catalog, click More then select Add to Catalog . You can add both running and stopped vApps to the catalog, although it's worth noting that creating a catalog image from a running vApp could affect performance. You can now choose the catalog you want to add the vApp to, give the vApp a new name, assign a storage lease, and define whether vApps deployed using this template are identical or customisable. You can also overwrite an existing catalog item. If the catalog you are adding the vApp to is published externally, you'll see a warning. When you're done, click OK .

    "title": "How to convert your edge to an advanced gateway | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to convert your edge to an advanced gateway Overview UKCloud for VMware offers advanced gateways to provide access to new vCloud Director functionality. Some of this functionality is available now, with other features being added following integration testing to assess suitability on our platform (some features may incur additional charges). Advanced gateways in UKCloud for VMware provide: NSX Tenant Portal - The new Tenant Portal is a pure HTML5 user interface that you can use in conjunction with the legacy vCloud Director Web Console. This portal provides an initial set of controls to configure Advanced Gateway NSX Edges. New API NSX management - vCloud Director 8.20 introduces a new proxy API that enables vCloud API clients to make requests to the NSX API. Unlike the NSX API, which is designed to address NSX objects in a global scope, such as a vCenter database, the vCloud Director API for NSX is designed to address NSX objects within the scope of a vCloud Director tenant organisation. SSH edge access - If you enable SSH, you can perform your own packet captures and troubleshoot your edge gateway yourself, without having to contact UKCloud Support. Advanced networking options - Distributed networking features, namely Distributed Firewall, Distributed Logical Router and L2 VPN, to improve the performance of traffic within your VDC. Important After converting your edge gateway to an advanced gateway, the API endpoint for configuring edge services will change. Any tooling that you use to amend the edge service configuration, such as adding firewall rules, will no longer work in its current state. For more information about using the advanced gateway API, see the vCloud Director API for NSX Programming Guide . Important After converting your edge to an advanced gateway, you will not be able to enable or disable logging on firewall rules via the advanced gateway GUI. To enable or disable logging, you must either use the API or raise a service request detailing the firewall rules for which you want to enable or disable logging so that we can action it on your behalf. When you convert an edge, the advanced gateway inherits the firewall logging configuration from the original edge. Enabling or disabling logging for NAT or load balancer services is not affected and you can edit those settings from the advanced gateway GUI as normal. For more information about using the API to amend firewall rules, see the vCloud Director API for NSX Programming Guide . This issue is fixed in vCloud Director 9.7. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have access to the UKCloud Portal and vCloud Director. Prerequisites and known issues Before converting your edge gateway, review the prerequisites and known issues below: Check your edge type - To check whether your edge is already an advanced gateway, in vCloud Director, select your VDC, select Edges , then select your edge. If the Convert to Advanced option is greyed out, your edge has already been converted. Click Configure Services to manage edge settings using the vCloud Director Tenant UI. Edge gateway version - When converting to an advanced gateway, your edge will be redeployed to the latest version. Important As the conversion process causes the gateway to redeploy, you should always schedule an edge conversion during an outage window. You can find out the version of your edge in the My VMs page of the UKCloud Portal. Select your VDC, select the Edge Gateway tab, then select your edge: For more detailed instructions, see Checking the current version of your edge gateway . Disabled firewalls - On an advanced gateway, if you disable the firewall, this also stops the NAT service, as it is dependent on the firewall. As a result, traffic flow that relies on NAT, such as NAT rules and the load balancer is stopped. If you attempt to disable the firewall service, the vCloud Director Web Console will display a warning. This is due to the firewall service being used to track stateful connections. See the following VMware Knowledge Base article for more information: https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2093153 . If you convert an edge that already has the firewall disabled to an advanced gateway, the converted advanced gateway will have the firewall enabled, but with an Any, Any, Allow rule so that all traffic is allowed inbound or outbound. Converting your edge to an advanced gateway To access the latest vCloud Director networking features, you need to convert your edge to an advanced gateway. To convert your edge to an advanced gateway: Using vCloud Director Legacy UI Using vCloud Director Tenant UI In vCloud Director, select the Administration tab. Double-click the VDC that the edge gateway belongs to. Select the Edge Gateways tab. Right-click the edge gateway that you want to convert and select Convert to Advanced Gateway . Click Yes to start the conversion. Important After converting your edge gateway, click Configure Services and check the firewall rules to make sure that the default rule for ingress traffic is set to Deny . In vCloud Director Virtual Datacenters dashboard, select the VDC that contains the edge gateway you want to convert. In the left navigation panel, click Edges . Select the edge that you want to convert and click the Convert to Advanced button. Click Yes to start the conversion. Important After converting your edge gateway, click Configure Services and check the firewall rules to make sure that the default rule for ingress traffic is set to Deny .

    "keywords": "How to connect to the UKCloud Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) Overview When you create a virtual machine (VM) running a Windows Server operating system, you need to register it with the UKCloud Windows Server Update Services to receive updates for it. Note UKCloud provides Windows updates for server operating systems and SQL. Before you establish a connection to the update service, you need to ensure your VMs can communicate with the update server, which exists outside your cloud organisation. This may involve editing the NAT and firewall settings on your edge gateway to allow traffic to traverse out of your virtual data centre (VDC). You'll need to open ports 443 and 8530 on your firewall to the update server. For more information on how to do this, see How to create NAT rules and How to create firewall rules . Configuring Windows update In this section you'll need to use the appropriate address depending on the location you're targeting. Open a console to the VM you want to update. Test connectivity to the update servers by opening an Internet Explorer browser window, then opening a connection to one of the update servers on: https://wsus.cor.ukcloud.com (Assured OFFICIAL, Corsham) https://wsus.frn.ukcloud.com (Assured OFFICIAL, Farnborough) For Elevated OFFICIAL, raise a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal to get the appropriate IP address Note Ensure that you can resolve this name via DNS or via a host entry you have manually put into your VMs. If you require details on what IP address you need to put into your host file, raise a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. Ensure that you have the full certificate chain installed. If not, you may have to install the certificates into your VM manually. Links for Root CA and Issuing CA: https://www.digicert.com/CACerts/DigiCertGlobalRootCA.crt https://www.digicert.com/CACerts/DigiCertSHA2SecureServerCA.crt For Windows Server 2008: Select Place all certificates in the following store. In the Select Certificate Store select the option Show Physical Stores. Install the certificate into Trusted Root Certification authorities/local PC. For Windows Server 2012 and 2016: On the welcome screen of the Certificate import wizard, select Local Machine, then click Next. Select Place all certificates in the following store, and click Browse. Highlight Trusted Root Certification Authorities and click OK. Click Next and confirm the import settings, then click Finish. Restart your browser and open a connection to https://wsus.cor.ukcloud.com , https://wsus.frn.ukcloud.com or the appropriate Elevated IP address. Confirm that no certificate warnings appear and that the full certificate chain is present. Run gpedit.msc . In the Group Policy Management Editor, expand and navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Update. Enable and configure the following settings: Specify intranet Microsoft update service location — in both boxes enter https://wsus.cor.ukcloud.com , https://wsus.frn.ukcloud.com or the appropriate Elevated IP address Configure Automatic Updates — enter required settings Enable client-side targeting — enter client in the group name field Open an elevated command prompt and type gpupdate /force . Open Windows update and click Check for updates. Replicating settings to other Windows VMs To quickly replicate the settings defined above to other Windows VMs in your environment: Copy the update server record in the host file to the additional VMs. Export the certificate from the trusted root folder to a file and import it to the additional VMs. Export the following key from the registry and import it onto the additional VMs: KEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate Restart the Windows update service on the additional VMs. UKCloud provides a PowerShell script in our public GitHub that changes these settings by changing the registry keys inside the VM. If you use this script, you do so at your own risk. Another option is to reference these settings in a Group Policy Object if you have Group Policy running in your environment.

    "title": "How to configure a load balancer | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to configure a load balancer Overview One of the functions of the edge gateway is to act as a basic layer 3 load balancer, distributing IP traffic to a pool of servers while appearing as a single virtual server. The load balancing methods offered are round-robin, IP hash, URI, HTTP header or least connected. Bear in mind, however, that the edge gateway load balancer is quite basic. If you need to meet more complex requirements, you'll need provide your own third-party virtual load balancer. The steps for configuring a load balancer vary depending on what type of edge gateway you're working with: Configuring a load balancer for an advanced gateway Configuring a load balancer for a standard edge Note We recommend that you convert your edge to an advanced gateway to access the latest vCloud Director functionality. For more information, see How to convert your edge to an advanced gateway . Configuring a load balancer for an advanced gateway To configure a load balancer for an advanced gateway: In vCloud Director, access the edge gateway settings.

    "keywords": "How to build a virtual machine with UKCloud for VMware (vCloud Director 9.1) Overview This guide leads you through the three basic steps for using UKCloud for VMware to quickly build a simple virtual machine (VM) in vCloud Director 9.1, and connect it to the internet. For more information about how to use other vCloud Director functions to make the most of UKCloud for VMware and create more complex virtual data centres (VDCs), take a look at the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware . The three steps covered in this guide are: Create a network (to move requests around your VMs) Configure the edge gateway (in this guide we focus on the firewall and NAT configuration) Create a virtual machine If you follow these steps, you can have a VM up and running with a connection to the internet in about 20 to 25 minutes. Note The steps in this guide are for vCloud Director 9.1. If your environment uses vCloud Director 8.20, see here . Before you begin You should have received your UKCloud Portal login credentials from your Portal administrator. You should have created a compute service and VDC within your account. For more information, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware . You should also have created an edge gateway, which enables communication between your VDC and the outside world. For more information, see How to build an edge gateway using the UKCloud Portal . The steps in this guide assume that you've converted your edge gateway to an advanced edge. For more information, see How to convert your edge to an advanced gateway . Create a network Before you can start building VMs in your VDC, you need to create the network that connects the VMs to each other and the outside world. First, you need to create a network that can connect to external networks outside your VDC (including the internet). This is called an external routed network . Log in to the UKCloud Portal. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal Select your account. In the Portal navigation panel, expand VMware Cloud and then select the compute service in which you want to create your VM. Tip If you haven't created a compute service yet, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware . On the vCloud Director tab, enter your Portal password and click Confirm . In the vCloud Director Virtual Datacenters dashboard, select your VDC. Tip If you haven't created a VDC yet, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware . You're creating a network, so, in the left navigation panel, select Network . To create a new network, click the Add button. Give the network a Name and Description . You can make your network available to other VDCs within the same region so that VMs can communicate with each other, regardless of which VDC they are in. For example, you may have a single repository server that provides updates for all the VMs in a region. For the purposes of this exercise, leave the Share this network check box empty. You want your VM to connect to the internet (rather than just other VMs in the same VDC), so in the Add Org VDC Network dialog box, choose the Routed network option. When you connect a network to the outside world, it's important that you control exactly what can access your environment via that network. UKCloud for VMWare uses edge gateways to do this, so select the edge that you want your new network to use (we'll work more with the edge gateway later on). Tip If you haven't created an edge gateway, see How to build an edge gateway using the UKCloud Portal . Scroll down the page to enter the details for the Gateway address , Network mask and Primary DNS . The example below uses 192.168.1.1 for the gateway, 255.255.255.0 for the mask and 8.8.8.8 for the DNS. A VM needs an IP address to identify it on the network. Use the Static IP Pool field to identify the range of IP addresses that VMs connecting to this network can use then click Add . For example, if your default gateway is 192.168.1.1 , you can use the 192.168.1.10-192.168.1.100 range for your static IP pool, giving 91 usable internal IP addresses. When you're done, click Add . When you're done, click Save . You can find more information about routed networks in How to create a routed VDC network . Configure the edge gateway The edge gateway is possibly the most complex part of the VDC because of its high level of functionality. The following steps show you how to quickly configure the edge gateway to enable you to access the internet from a VM. Note NAT rules only work if the firewall is enabled. For security reasons, you should ensure that the firewall is always enabled. In the vCloud Director Virtual Datacenters dashboard, select your VDC. This time you're working with the edge gateway, so in the left navigation panel, click Edges . Select the edge gateway you want to work with and click the Configure Services button. Note The steps that follow describe how to change the edge gateway settings for an advanced gateway. If necessary, convert your edge using the steps in How to convert your edge to an advanced gateway . Each tab in the Edge Gateway dialog box provides access to a different service provided by the edge gateway. The main tabs are: Firewall - As well as a physical firewall, you can control which networks and ports can communicate through the edge gateway. You'll set up some firewall rules later in this exercise. DHCP - The edge gateway can act as a DHCP server for VMs connected to Org networks connected to an edge. The DHCP tab shows DHCP information for any VDC networks that have been configured with DHCP, and so acts as a centralised view. For more information, see How to create a DHCP pool . NAT - Network address translation, both in (DNAT) and out (SNAT) of the edge gateway. You'll set up some NAT rules later in this exercise. Routing - You can provide static routes from the edge gateway to other networks, for example networks in other VDCs in your compute service. For more information, see How to create a static route . Load Balancer - The edge gateway provides simple HTTP and HTTPS load balancing using round robin. For more information, see How to configure a load balancer . VPN - IPsec site‑to‑site VPN is available on the edge gateway. It can be configured within the vCloud user interface, but may require additional configuration through the API. For more information, see How to configure IPsec VPN . To access the internet from a VM, you'll need to create firewall rules to determine who can access your network and NAT rules to route traffic within your network. Creating firewall rules Let's start with firewall rules: In the Edge Gateway dialog box, select the Firewall tab. Make sure the Enabled option is selected. Click the + button to add a new row to the firewall rules table. Edit the values in the row for the New Rule using the settings below: Name - HTTPS outbound Source - internal Destination - external Service - Click the + button and enter the following values in the Add Service dialog box Protocol - TCP Source Port - any Destination Port - 443 Click Keep when you're done. Action - Accept These settings allow traffic from the VMs ( Source = internal ) to reach destinations outside your VDC ( Destination = external ) on port 443 (HTTPS). You'll need to repeat these steps for ports 80 (HTTP) and 53 (DNS). Note For DNS, the protocol should be UDP. You can also allow traffic to reach your VMs from outside your VDC by swapping the Source and Destination values. However, because this opens up your firewall to a lot of traffic, we recommend that you first complete this guide to get comfortable with general networking concepts, and then take a look at the information in How to create firewall rules where you can find out how to lock the firewall down. Click Save changes . Creating NAT rules Now that you've set up the firewall rules, you can create NAT rules: In the Edge Gateways dialog box, select the NAT tab. Click the SNAT Rule button to create a source NAT (SNAT) rule to translate internal IP addresses into something that the external network can understand. In the Add SNAT Rule dialog box, from the Applied on list, choose the edge gateway to which you want to apply the SNAT rule. In the Original Source IP/Range field, enter the range of addresses you created when you created the network in the previous exercise. In the Translated Source IP/Range field, enter one or more of the external IP addresses provided to you by UKCloud. If you are not sure what your IP addresses are, see How to find your allocated external IP addresses . When you're done, click Keep and then Save changes . You can also add destination NAT (DNAT) rules to translate external IP addresses to route traffic to the appropriate internal addresses. However, because the firewall only provides outbound access to the internet, we don't need to add DNAT rules at the moment. You can find more information about setting up NAT rules in How to create NAT rules . Create a virtual machine Now that you've laid the groundwork, it's time to create your VM. The best way to do this is to create a virtual application (vApp). You can think of a vApp as a container for your VMs; it enables you to group related VMs together to manage them in one place. See How to create a vApp to find out more. In the vCloud Director Virtual Datacenters dashboard, select your VDC. In the left navigation panel, click vApps . In this exercise, you'll create the vApp from scratch, so click the Build New vApp button. In the Build new vApp dialog box, give the vApp a Name and Description . Click Add Virtual Machine . In the Create VM dialog box, you can create your VM. Enter a Name , Computer Name and Description for the VM. Tip The Name is to identify the VM, the Computer Name is the host name of the VM. The easiest way to create a VM is to use a pre-built template from a catalog, so from the Type radio buttons, select From Template . From the list of Templates , select the one you want to use then click OK . Back in the Build new vApp dialog box, you can add more VMs if you want, but for now click Build to create the vApp and the single VM. There are some more configuration tasks to complete for your new VM, so in the left navigation panel, click Virtual Machines to list all the VMs in the VDC. In the card for your new VM, click Details . In the General section, you can change the VM name in the Name field, but keep the default Storage Policy option. Expand the Hardware section and, in the NICs section, click Add and select the externally routed Network you created in the first exercise. From the IP Mode list, choose Static - IP Pool to use the IP pool you defined earlier when you created your network. Select the Connected check box. You don't need to change anything in the other sections, so click Save . In the card for the VM, click Power and select Power On Click the monitor icon to open the popout console and go through the setup procedure. To confirm that you have connectivity to the internet and have an assigned IP address: Type ipconfig into the Command Prompt. If you've configured the networking correctly, your VM will return an IP address. Open an internet browser page and navigate to an external web page Ping the IP address of your DNS (for example, 8.8.8.8 ) through the command line.

    "keywords": "UKCloud for VMware FAQs Service What is the service? UKCloud for VMware is an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering which enables organisations to rapidly provision and scale secure virtual machines (VMs) in minutes, in a flexible and autonomous manner. UKCloud provides this service across two security domains, Assured OFFICIAL (formerly PGA IL2) and Elevated OFFICIAL (formerly PGA IL3), and with a range of service levels offering up to 99.99% availability. This choice allows customers to precisely match application and user needs to an appropriate security domain, service level and cost, instead of designing to the highest level which may not always be needed. Can VMs have different characteristics? Yes. We offer three VM Types: Essential, Power and Priority. VM characteristics are inherited from the VDC the VM is deployed in. It is not currently possible to have a VDC that has mixed VM types. However, customers can use multiple VDCs to deliver their solution. Are VMs contended? Essential VMs are contended: VMs contend for memory and processor resources. Power & Priority VMs: UKCloud has implemented a combination of technical and process controls (for example, an ISO 20000-certified capacity management process) to ensure that these VMs don't contend for memory or processor resources. Power VMs operate where automated rebalancing is enabled to pre-emptively optimise performance and availability. Priority VMs differ from other VM types. Automated rebalancing is configured to reduce workload movement around the platform, reducing workload disruption. How do the new VM types align with the previous VM SLA types? Before the change to the new VM types in G-Cloud 8, VMs and VDCs were set by their SLA level such as Test and Dev and Production. To help, the transition to VM types is explained below: DEV & TEST BASIC = ESSENTIAL VM Type Production BASIC = POWER VM Type Production STANDARD = POWER VM Type ENHANCED - This service level has been retired from sale as of 1 January 2019 The new pricing structure introduced in G-Cloud 8 enables customers to customise their VMs and any options without being tied to a specific package. Thus, options such as backups and Journaling Protection can be added regardless of the VM type. Can a VM communicate to another VM at of a different type? Yes. VMs can communicate with each other. In some cases, customers may need to use the built-in self-service IPsec VPN functionality to create a virtual private network within our Assured cloud platform. Can VMs types be changed? Yes, but the customer must first export the VMs, then import them back into the virtual data centre (VDC) that has been created with the target VM type. Can I convert from one VM type to another, without having to move VMs between vDCs? Customers can manage the migration between VM types. Customers can also move vApps and VMs between VDCs as long as they're in the same assurance domain, for example Assured to Assured. More complex migrations, from the Assured to the Elevated platform, must be managed by UKCloud. If you want to migrate a vApp larger than 1.5TiB, you'll need to engage the UKCloud support team to facilitate the process. To do so, raise a Service Request on the UKCloud Portal. What hypervisor do you use? UKCloud's environment is built using VMware vSphere, the most ubiquitous and mature hypervisor available. Secure multi-tenancy is achieved with VMware vCloud Director. Can I have a read-only account in vCloud for monitoring? This is available on the UKCloud Portal under permissions that can be set by your account admin. Virtual machines (VMs) Do I get root access onto the local VM? Yes, as this is a true IaaS cloud service, you have complete control and autonomy over each VM, and so have full 'root' or administrative access. What VM sizes are available? UKCloud offers a variety of 'T-shirt sizes' to meet customers' needs. The smallest configuration is 512MiB and 1 vCPU. The largest is 128GiB memory with 12 vCPU. Check the UKCloud for VMware Service Definition for more details on the currently available sizes. Dedicated Compute provides the flexibility to build custom-sized VMs. Can I resize a VM? Yes, you can change vCPU, RAM and storage allocations via the self-service UKCloud Portal and API. Processors and memory can be added to or removed from VMs if the OS supports the 'hot add' capability. Increasing CPU or memory allocations may result in the VM being billed at a higher rate. Additional VM storage can be allocated instantly and will be billed on a per GiB basis. What is the speed of each vCPU? This is set at 2GHz for all VMs except Micro sized VMs, which can be restricted to run at 500MHz. What is the fastest way of importing large amounts of data onto the UKCloud platform? The speed of data transfer to the UKCloud platform isn't guaranteed. However, during tests of the upload and download speeds, an average of 8 Mbit/s was achieved for VM import/export and 40 Mbit/s for data transferred over FTPS. For a transfer time calculator, go to: http://techinternets.com/copy_calc?do If you use FTPS to upload data to or download it from your environment, you can transfer up to 1TiB of data in a day. Alternatively, we offer the Mass Transfer Facility option enabling customers to import large quantities of data via HDDs or NAS devices that are plugged directly into your environment. Please check the Mass Transfer Facility Service Scope for NAS or HDD , or the pricing guide further details. Does UKCloud offer encryption on the VM? Not by default but, if it's required, you can implement it using technology of your choice inside the VM's operating system. Is UKCloud's encryption service available for UKCloud for VMware? Not currently, but we are considering this as an option. Provide feedback via UKCloud Ideas . Is it possible to non-fast-provision vApps, and to convert current vApps into non-fast provisioned ones? Fast provisioning is enabled only by customer request - by default, all vApps are non-fast-provisioned. Customers can right-click on a VM and consolidate. This can also be done via a Service Request. What is Dedicated Compute? Dedicated Compute comprises of physical blades assigned to a customer for their sole use. They're managed using the standard tools and services in the UKCloud Assured cloud platform. Dedicated Compute allows customers to: Comply with legacy licensing requirements from software suppliers whose licensing is based on a physical CPU (such as Oracle or desktop OSs) Build bespoke sized VMs on the UKCloud Assured cloud platform Dedicated Compute uses the same storage infrastructure as the shared compute platform There's a longer deployment lead time for Dedicated Compute, as well as a longer contractual commitment than our shared cloud platform (three months rather than one hour). For more details, please see the UKCloud for VMware Service Definition available via the Digital Marketplace. Can I utilise multiple storage types with my VM? UKCloud offers two storage types to customers: Tier 1 which is a fast storage offering Tier 2 which is a standard storage offering With Tier 1 and Tier 2 storage, customers can utilise both types to deliver their solutions - including running VMs utilising disks on different storage types. Can I change between storage types associated with the VMs I've deployed? If a customer has both Tier 1 and Tier 2 storage profiles available, they can self-migrate between these storage types. What happens when I switch off my VMs using the guest Operating System? If you shut down your VM using the guest OS, we will recognise this as a 'Power Off' event and you will not be billed whilst the VM remains in this state. Billing will resume once the VM is powered on again. How do I change the workload type of a VDC? To change the workload type (for example, ESSENTIAL, POWER or PRIORITY) of a VDC, you must raise a service request from within My Calls, and the support team will make the necessary changes. Please note this change is disruptive and UKCloud will be required to power down all VMs in the VDC during this transition. Networking How many IP addresses do I get? You're initially allocated five external IP addresses with a new compute service. You can ask for more external IP addresses via a Service Request. Please note that there is a £20 charge per additional IP address. There's no limit to the number of internal IP addresses (RFC1918) you can allocate. How many PSN IP addresses do I get? Customer organisations are initially allocated one external PSN IP address. Additional external PSN IP addresses can be requested via a Service Request should a valid business requirement arise. Please note that there is a £20 charge per additional IP address. There's no limit to the number of internal IP addresses (RFC1918) customers can allocate. What firewall services are available? UKCloud controls and manages a perimeter firewall on the edge of our Assured cloud platform which securely segregates traffic. Within the UKCloud for VMware environment, we provide you with a dedicated self-managed virtual firewall which delivers typical firewall functionality such as access control lists and network address translation, as well as basic load balancing and support for VPNs. You can also use your preferred firewall and security appliances, as long as they're compatible with the VMware virtual infrastructure used to power the UKCloud Assured cloud platform. How do I create and manage firewall rules? Your UKCloud-provided dedicated virtual firewall is managed exclusively by you. You can set and manage firewall rules via the UKCloud Portal and API. On-boarding guides and associated video tutorials are available to help customers configure and manage their firewalls. Can I bring my own firewall? Customers can choose to deploy the firewall technology of their choice. This service, how to order it, and the constraints it may place on operation, is fully documented within our knowledge centre. How does UKCloud provide urgent maintenance notifications and incident reports? You can view these on the notifications page on the UKCloud Portal. In addition, Service Status reports are published on the service status page. Do you offer dynamic or static IP addresses? The external IP addresses are static. Internal IPs can be assigned statically from a pool, manually or dynamically via DHCP. Are external Domain Name System (DNS) services available? No, we don't currently offer this service. You can implement your own DNS servers within your solution, or configure your virtual firewall to enable connectivity to an externally hosted DNS server - for example, one hosted on a government secure network such as PSN, Janet or HSCN; or one available on the Internet such as Google 8.8.8.8 . Are domain name registration services available? No, we don't currently offer this service. Some government secure networks (such as PSN and HSCN) offer domain name registration and DNS hosting as part of their service. For internet-facing services a third-party DNS provider will be required. Is Network Time Protocol available for time synchronisation? Yes this is available for Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL. See Network Time Protocol server access for details. Can UKCloud provide SSL certificates or can existing SSL certificates be used? UKCloud doesn't provide SSL certificates, but you can use your existing ones. Some government secure networks (such as PSN and HSCN) provide SSL certificates as part of their service. Do you offer load balancing? Yes. Load balancing can be configured within the service and is included within the price. Supported protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, TCP. Supported algorithms: Round Robin, IP Hash, URI, Least Connected. Can I deploy my own load balancer? Yes, you can deploy your own load-balancing virtual appliance (for example, F5, Stingray, Zeus) if support for other algorithms is required. In addition, UKCloud offer Global Load Balancing from Neustar which can be customised for your own specific requirements. An FAQ and Service Scope are available in the Knowledge Centre. Storage How much storage do I get with a VM? The default amount of storage which comes with a VM is 60GiB of Tier 2 storage. The exception is Micro sized VMs. These have a fixed 10GiB allocation which cannot be increased. If this allocation is exceeded, the VM is treated as Tiny. Can I reallocate storage across VMs? No, storage pooling isn't possible. Each VM must have a minimum of 60GiB (except Micro VMs). You can quickly and easily allocate additional storage via the self-service UKCloud Portal or API. Additional storage is charged on a per-GiB basis as listed in the UKCloud pricing guide. Is storage persistent? Yes, unlike some other cloud platforms, storage is persistent. This means that your data and VM configuration remain available to you even if the VM is switched off or restarted. What is the Tier 1 storage solution? Tier 1 storage (formerly Optimised) is designed for the following scenarios: Applications that require improved performance when accessing stored data such as high activity databases Applications that have irregular usage patterns that require a consistent performance such as data warehouses or batch process applications Existing applications can take advantage of Tier 1 Storage. A migration process maybe involved. Tier 1 Storage is available for use with all VM types and compatible with all protection technologies. Talk to your UKCloud Account Director or Cloud Architect to understand if Tier 1 storage can benefit your solution. What are independent disks? Independent disks are a technology provided natively by VMware vCloud Director, and are included as options by default in the UKCloud service. They can only be created via the API, and cannot be created though the user interface. UKCloud has provided some advice on how to create and control them here . Independent disks are stand-alone virtual disks that you create in organization VDCs. Administrators and users who have adequate rights can create, remove, and update independent disks, and connect them to virtual machines. When you create an independent disk, it is associated with an organization VDC but not with a virtual machine. After the disk has been created in a VDC, the disk owner or an administrator can attach it to any virtual machine deployed in that VDC. The disk owner can also modify disk properties, detach it from a virtual machine, and remove it from the VDC. The system administrator and organization administrator of the organization that contains the VDC have the same rights to use and modify the disk as the disk owner. Only one VM can be connected to an independent disk at a time. Why have independent disks started to appear on my bill? Previously, independent disks appeared on customer invoices when they were actively attached to a virtual machine. This meant that customers continually mounting and dismounting independent disks may not have seen the true size of their UKCloud VMware environment. We have improved our reporting to advise customers of the independent disks they have currently created, and the amount of storage associated with those disks, and the monthly cost associated with those disks. What if I use my independent disks with the same VM all the time? We advise that you move the data in the independent disk into a disk associated with a single VM - this will allow you to take advantage of the free 60GiB of storage included with all UKCloud VMs. What rate are independent disks charged at? Independent disks will be charged at the rate of the storage they are stored on, along with any additional protection applied (Journaling or Snapshot Protection) and charged at a rate per GiB per month. Can I use the 60GiB included with my VM on an independent disk? No, as an independent disk can be mounted to any VMs inside a customer's VDC, so is not associated with a single VM. How much included storage do I get with Dedicated Compute? You will receive the same allowance as for UKCloud for VMware VMs. For example, 60GiB of Tier 2 storage when the VM is powered on for free. Please note, when the VM is in a powered off state any storage associated with the VM will be charged at the prevailing rate. Management How do I access my systems? You can access your VMs using: The remote console through the UKCloud Portal Remote access protocols (RDP/SSH) over a VPN or secure network What reports can I get about VM performance? You can monitor their performance using standard tools within the operating system. Additionally, UKCloud provides retrospective performance information via its Portal API. Does UKCloud patch the VMs? No, customers are responsible for the patching of their services. We make a patch repository available to customers for VMs on the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform (which cannot connect to the internet) for common operating systems that we provide. How do I access support and patches for operating systems that UKCloud licenses? UKCloud provides a repository of patches for common operating systems for customers to access and update from. Please refer to the Knowledge Centre for details. For support, you'll need to log a request with UKCloud, who will log the ticket with the relevant supplier. UKCloud will then inform you about any updates. However, UKCloud isn't responsible for the actual resolution of non-IaaS issues. Do you have a Key Management System (KMS) for activating Windows? Yes. A step-by-step guide on configuring and using this service is included in How to license Windows VMs using the UKCloud Key Management Server . There are additional supporting documents regarding the registration on VMs targeting the UKCloud KMS. How do I control a VM? You control a VM via the UKCloud Portal or API. Controls include stop, start, restart, load media, clone, snapshot, and so on. Do you monitor VMs? UKCloud monitors the underlying platform but doesn't monitor customers' OSs or applications. Customers can implement their own application performance monitoring solutions within the VDC. Do you offer autoscaling? There's no standard product offering for autoscale, but the platform API can be used to do this with a little developer effort. We provide blueprints on the UKCloud web site that offer guidance on this. How quickly can I scale my service up or down? Horizontal scale can be achieved quickly by adding additional VMs (usually in just a few minutes). Vertical scaling can be achieved by 'hot adding' vCPU or RAM to a VM (where supported by the guest OS). This operation usually takes seconds. Licensing, software and anti-virus What operating systems are available? UKCloud UKCloud for VMware is powered by VMware technology, so is compatible with a wide range of x86/x64 operating systems. VMware provides a compatibility matrix at: http://partnerweb.vmware.com/comp_guide2/pdf/VMware_GOS_Compatibility_Guide.pdf . You can use the UKCloud catalogue of operating systems or upload your own. We offer Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise, Windows 2012, Windows 2016, Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS. In addition, we provide access to common templates provided by the Bitnami service such as Drupal, Joomla, LAMP and Wordpress. How can I licence an operating system? Microsoft Microsoft terms and conditions preclude customers from using their own licence agreements for Windows Server in the Cloud. That means all licensing for Windows Server operating systems must be provided by UKCloud. Microsoft offers License Mobility, a scheme that allows a customer to provide additional software such as Exchange, SQL and so on, as long as the customer has appropriate Microsoft licensing as per the licence terms and conditions and usage rights. In order to use License Mobility, you must complete the form that is available in the Knowledge Centre and send this by post to Microsoft. If you require SQL licensing to be provided by UKCloud, this can be done by completing a Service Request from the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. SQL standard licensing is charged per hour per VM, whilst SQL Enterprise is charged monthly per VM. It is essential that UKCloud are informed of every instance of SQL on the platform, and that you complete a Licence Mobility form for all licences that you use on the UKCloud platform. RHEL RHEL operating systems can be licensed by UKCloud or the customer. The customer is responsible for ensuring correct licensing for any other operating system they chose to install. If you wish to use your own RHEL licencing, please a Service request. How up to date are the operating system images and mirrors? All CentOS, Ubuntu, Red Hat and Debian distributions include update mechanisms to install the latest patches and releases. For a list of supported operating systems, and instructions on how to access these update repositories, see the Knowledge Centre. What anti-virus do you offer on this service? UKCloud doesn't provide any anti-virus by default, so customers are advised to install their own anti-virus (AV) software to protect their workloads. What applications are available as part of the default service? UKCloud does not offer any additional software other than what's included in the UKCloud Portal catalogue. Any additional software, including its licensing, is the customer's responsibility. Are Open Virtualisation Format (OVF) VM images supported? Yes, OVF images can be uploaded to the platform, and VMs built in the platform can be downloaded as OVF. What is Bring Your Own (BYO) licensing for Red Hat? BYO licensing for Red Hat allows customers to select VMs running on the UKCloud Assured cloud platform for covering by their own commercial agreement with Red Hat. UKCloud will remove the cost of the Red Hat licence from the customer's monthly bill for the selected VMs. Customers need to raise a Service Request to let us know which VMs they will cover with their own Red Hat licence. Support How do I raise a support ticket? The secure online UKCloud Portal provides most common service management functionality. Alternatively, you can contact support by phone or email. How do I manage my services? Services on the Assured OFFICIAL platform can be managed over the internet (or other connectivity) via the UKCloud Portal. For the Elevated OFFICIAL platform, security requirements are stricter and require either a PSN-approved connection, UKCloud Secure Remote Access or a self-managed CPA-approved (or equivalent standard) VPN solution (for example, site-to-site VPN). What are your service maintenance windows? As far as possible, planned maintenance of UKCloud's infrastructure takes place between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Sunday, or between the hours of 08:00 and 12:00 (UK local time) on a Saturday or Sunday. We provide customers with at least 14 days' advance notice of planned maintenance. As far as possible, emergency maintenance of UKCloud's infrastructure takes place between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Sunday, or between the hours of 08:00 and 12:00 (UK local time) on Saturday or Sunday, unless there is an identified and demonstrable immediate risk to a customer's environment. Whenever possible, we provide customers with at least six hours' advance notice of emergency maintenance. Can I configure email alerts from the Portal? Yes, you can have Portal notifications sent to you at the email address associated with your Portal login. Notifications provide information about updates to UKCloud services, in addition to maintenance and incident notifications. This feature is available in both the Assured and Elevated Portals. Onboarding How can I get started with the service? Within four hours of accepting your order, we'll create your primary administrator account, and send you a Welcome Pack, which includes the URL for the UKCloud Portal and associated authentication details. You administrator can then create additional accounts for users within the project. Each user can then log on and begin using the service (depending on the security domain and connectivity). At the time of order, you can specify which of our two UK data centres you'd like to be deployed into. Meeting your request is at UKCloud's discretion. Is there a free trial? Yes, we offer a 30-day free trial so that you can test and evaluate our service without commitment. Your trial provides you with a live environment on the UKCloud platform to test our services and verify whether they are suited to your needs. How do I request a trial? You can request a trial via the UKCloud website: http://www.UKCloud.com/free-trial-sign-up and accept the trial terms and conditions. Your environment will then be set up and you will be given trial credits to the equivalent of £500. What do I do when my trial comes to an end? You will be contacted by your Cloud Architect or CSM when your trial is due to end, either because you have run out of credits or reached 30 days (whichever is sooner). At the end of your trial, you have the option to transition to production or cease the trial. Protection Can I create a clone of my environment? Yes, you can do this through the UKCloud Portal by right-clicking on a vApp and selecting 'Copy'. This operation can also be performed programmatically via the API. It's not possible to restrict the automated VM snapshot backup to specific files or directories. You can install your own backup service and use our Cloud Storage if you need more flexibility. Can I still use Synchronous Protection for my VMs? Synchronous Protection is no longer available as protection option for UKCloud for VMware. We recommend using one of our other protection options: Journaling Protection or Snapshot Protection. We will continue to provide support to customers who previously added Synchronous Protection to their environment. Snapshot Protection What are snapshots? A snapshot is NOT a copy of the VMDK. Creating a snapshot locks out the base VMDK file and any changes to the data are written to the snapshot delta VMDK. If you wish to \"roll back\" to the point in time that the snapshot was created and discard any changes since, you can \"revert\" the snapshot, which essentially deletes it and discards any changes. If you are happy with the changes made since the snapshot was created, you can \"delete\" the snapshot, which essentially consolidated all changes back into the base VMDK. Please see advice on best practice regarding snapshots in this article . Snapshots can be created using the vCloud Director portal and are stored in the same zone as the source VM. This is not to be confused with the UKCloud snapshot protection service, which uses a temporary snapshot in order to backup the VM to an external system in another UKCloud site. For further reference, this article explains the different recovery options available to you through vCloud Director. In order to identify old snapshots, UKCloud have created this article which contains scripts to run a health check of your VMs. Can I restrict automated VM snapshot backup to specific files or directories? It's not possible to restrict the automated VM snapshot backup to specific files or directories. You can install your own backup service and use our Cloud Storage if you need more flexibility. How quickly can a VM be restored? This depends on the size of the VM, the location from which it's being restored, and the priority of the support ticket raised to request the restoration. Customers should expect recovery to take two to three days. If you require a faster recovery time, you must implement your own backup/restore solution which will be entirely under their control. Our Cloud Storage platform could be an appropriate target for self-managed backups using software such as CommVault and NetWorker. What rate are snapshots charged at? Snapshots will be charged at the rate of the storage they are stored on (Tier 1 or Tier 2), and charged per GiB per month. Can I use the 60GiB included with my VM for snapshots? Yes, you can use the 60GiB included with the VM for snapshots. If I have Snapshot Protection on Dedicated Compute, what will I be charged for? You will only be charged for the protection of the storage consumed, not the VM. Disaster Recovery Does UKCloud provide a DR service? Disaster Recovery as a Service (powered by Zerto) can help you improve organisational resilience. It enables rapid migration of applications between your local VMware or Hyper-V based VMs and UKCloud for VMware disaster recovery-enabled regions. An alternative UKCloud solution to achieve DR with a low RPO and RTO is Journaling Protection . How does UKCloud enable customers to create their own DR solutions? Although we have engineered our cloud platform to tolerate failures and ensure customers' services remain available, we encourage all our customers to design for failure and build DR capabilities into the system design, or into the application. To help this process, the UKCloud platform has been designed to give you the options you need to design a disaster tolerant solution. UKCloud's platform is about providing customers with choice. Clearly, customers need to balance the low probability of these failure scenarios occurring with the cost and complexity involved in mitigating their impact. Depending on the type of failure you are trying to mitigate, UKCloud services have been developed to enable you to design appropriate resilience into your solution. At a macro level, UKCloud operate out of two sites. Designing across multiple sites will provide resilience against even the most unlikely of scenarios - including natural disasters and mass WAN failure. UKCloud currently offer two sites: The independent cloud platform at our Corsham site The independent cloud platform at our Farnborough site Each site also offers independent regions. These are physically segregated parts of the UKCloud platform that have an independent power and networking components - allowing customers to architect resilient solutions out of a single site. Services in different regions also have independent control planes. By architecting for separate regions, you improve your resilience to outages that effect the control and management of your VMs. Finally, each region has a number of distinct hardware zones. For customers looking to architect against mass hardware failures. Zones can be utilised to provide additional confidence in your ability to tolerate outages. For example, you can load-balance across two zones to ensure that your service stays online in the event of an unlikely outage. In some rare failure scenarios (such as DDoS or Split Brain) the availability of the cloud platform at both our sites may be affected. These scenarios can be mitigated by deploying across multiple cloud providers. Billing and legal What is the smallest unit of time I will be billed for? The minimum unit of time for use is one hour. Part hours will be rounded up. Dedicated Compute has a minimum commit of three months. What are the charges to transfer data between VMs within the same data centre? None. Data transfer between VMs in this scenario is free. Will I be charged even if my Virtual Machine is powered off? You will not be charged for any Virtual Machines whilst they are turned off, however whilst the VM is in a powered off state, any storage associated with the VM will be charged for at the prevailing rate. This includes the 10GiB included with Micro machines and 60GiB in all other VM sizes of Tier 2 storage. How will I be billed for additional storage? Customers can allocate additional storage to VMs on demand. UKCloud will bill customers for additional allocated storage, regardless of the powered on/off state. Additional storage will also include storage used for templates and media items. What is a template or media item? Within UKCloud for VMware Virtual Data Centres (VDC), you can deploy your own templates, media items or catalogue images. These include templates for applications and Operating Systems. How can I view billing information? Billing information is available via the UKCloud Portal. How can I pay for the services? Payment for UKCloud services can be made by direct bank transfer (BACS/CHAPS). You can find bank details for payment on your invoice. If you signed up with a credit or debit card, your payment card will be automatically charged no sooner than seven (7) days after the invoice date. What are the termination fees? There are no termination costs for this service. Customers are responsible for extracting their own data from the UKCloud for VMware if required. UKCloud may make an additional charge for transferring data out of the service. How is resource usage billed? Actual real-time resource usage is measured to the nearest second. At the end of each day, periods of time in identical VM state are grouped together and the total for each group in seconds is rounded up to the nearest hour. An identical VM state has the same power status, VM size, service level, storage size, protection and licence. Where rounding up of multiple periods in differing states during the same day would result in more than 24 hours of charges, the period with the lowest price per hour is rounded down. For example, if a VM was switched off for a total of 890 minutes but was on for 550 minutes, the billable hours would be rounded up to 10 hours for when the VM was on and the off period would be rounded down to 14 hours to cap the day at 24 hours. Will I be charged for creating snapshots? Snapshot Protection can be purchased with any VM and will be charged for in accordance with the Pricing Guide. Self-service snapshots created within vCloud Director will incur charges as of November 2017. These will be accounted for in the invoices you receive at the beginning of December. Security What data is suitable for the UKCloud assured cloud platform? The service is hosted in the UK and operated by UK government security-cleared staff. It has extensive independent validation (including NCSC design reviews) that it is fully aligned with the 14 NCSC Cloud Security Principles, and is therefore ideal for all data classified at OFFICIAL (including OFFICIAL SENSITIVE). Can systems on different UKCloud security domains communicate with one and another? UKCloud's Cross Domain Security Zone allows customers to use the UKCloud-defined and managed UKCloud Guard, or a customer-designed and managed Walled Garden to enable communication between platforms. For more information, see the Cross Domain Security Zone documentation. Is there a protective monitoring service? Protective Monitoring is included for our IaaS platform and follows GPG 13.

    "title": "Synchronous Protection FAQs | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Synchronous Protection FAQs General Is Synchronous Protection still available? Synchronous Protection is no longer available as a protection option for UKCloud for VMware. We recommend using one of our other protection options: Journaling Protection or Snapshot Protection. We will continue to provide support to customers who previously added Synchronous Protection to their environment, although we would encourage considering using Journaling Protection instead. What is the ENHANCED service? ENHANCED was a G-Cloud 7 service level option which was subsequently replaced with the product name \"Synchronous Protection\". However, for most purposes, Journaling Protection is more flexible. How is the environment protected? Any data that is written is committed to the underlying storage arrays in both UKCloud sites synchronously. This includes the full content of your VMs and edge gateway instances. For clarity, this is not an asynchronous replication technology and the recovery point is the last write to disk, with no historical recovery points. If asynchronous replication with historical recovery points is required, consider Journaling Protection . How is an unplanned failover event triggered? We monitor the underlying physical infrastructure, including the blades, routers and switches. In the event of multiple component failure, including loss of redundancy, in the majority of cases your VMs and edge gateway instances will be automatically brought online in the alternative site. However, other scenarios can result in a full or partial failover, and in these cases we'll need to react differently. What might I need to factor into my design? You need to be aware of what this service offers. The UKCloud Synchronous Protection service option: Is not designed to be active‑active. It offers failover to a second UK site. If you need an active‑active solution, you can build across both sites and design in load balancing. Contact your Account Manager if you want to investigate this option. Provides a disaster recovery service with an RPO of 0 seconds, and a variable RTO from 1 minute to longer, depending on the scenario. What will I need to do after an unplanned failover has occurred? In the event of an unplanned failover, because your VMs are restarted in a crash-consistent state, you may need to manually restart parts of your environment to ensure that your applications continue running as before. You may also need to check your external connectivity to ensure that all networking has been correctly rerouted. What is the impact on latency? A consequence of synchronous replication is that there is a higher write latency (time taken for a write to be acknowledged). This is primarily due to the time taken for the write request to occur on both sites. Typically, this means that writes take 15‑20ms (compared to 5‑10ms if Synchronous Protection is not selected). Depending on the workload, this may have a noticeable impact. If an application performs a large sequence of writes in series (one at a time), then the impact of the higher write latency will be felt. If, on the other hand, the application performs a number of writes in parallel (multiple writes at the same time), then the impact of the higher write latency will be significantly less. We highly recommend that applications deployed with Synchronous Protection are designed and configured to perform write operations in parallel. As a best practice, we would also recommend ensuring that the file systems are block aligned - that is of particular relevance with Synchronous Protection. Most modern operating systems are block aligned by default, but this may still be of relevance with the additional file systems created manually on Linux. If you are unable to architect your application to make use of parallel writes, and the increased latency cannot be tolerated, then you should consider alternatives to Synchronous Protection, utilising application replication for protection between sites. For clarity, Synchronous Protection makes no difference to read latency. How is the network rerouted? For internet-bound traffic, we manage an autonomous Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) service that enables us to intelligently redirect traffic without affecting your IP address allocation. The resilience of the external connectivity into the Elevated OFFICIAL security domain depends on, and is generally provided by, the access network. Behind the router layer, we have designed a network that stretches between our two sites. This allows for network connectivity (if installed in one site) to remain if your virtual firewall and our physical firewall are in separate and alternative sites. We advise that you consider how additional services, such as Cloud Enablement and leased lines, will be affected in a disaster recovery (DR) scenario, as this falls outside the Synchronous Protection service option. UKCloud's firewalls are protected within each site, with the failover between the sites performed via an orchestrated process. We achieve this through a sequence of routing changes within our network. How long will it take for my services to fail over? This will depend on the scenario and the design of your environment, but generally the failover will take as long as the VM needs to reboot plus a small amount of additional time to invoke the failover - about 45 seconds. Some scenarios, such as a \"split brain\", can take longer, leading to an outage of up to two hours. What is the relationship between edge gateways, VDCs and vOrgs when a failover occurs? When a failure occurs, edge gateways, virtual data centres (VDCs) and organisations and their inherent rules, are failed over with all other VMs. Can I ask for the VMs in my environment to be split between UKCloud sites? You cannot specifically request this as part of the service, but UKCloud retains the right to do this if necessary, such as during planned maintenance. Can I be alerted when a VM is moved to a different site? This feature isn't currently supported. However, you can check the location of your VMs. For more information, see How to use VM location in vCloud Director . Failover testing How can I test that my services will fail over? You can test the failover function of the service by requesting a Test Scenario from UKCloud. For more information, see the Synchronous Protection Service Scope . Snapshot Protection Will I be charged for using Snapshot Protection if I opt for Synchronous Protection? Synchronous Protection with Geo-resilience comes with 14-day Snapshot Protection as standard when selected, with the option for 28-day Snapshot Protection free of charge. Please note that you will be charged for any storage consumed associated with the Snapshot Protection option if enabled.

    "title": "Snapshot Protection FAQs | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Snapshot Protection FAQs General What is a protection technology? Protection technologies are tools used to enable you to design resilience into your cloud solutions. They protect data and provide you with the ability to recover from system outages - either caused by a disruption to the physical delivery of a service or a result of a corruption of your primary system. What protection options does UKCloud offer? By default, VMs deployed on the UKCloud platform do not come with any protection services enabled. However, you can opt to utilise one of the platform based protection technologies, such as: Snapshot protection - automatically takes an image of your VM every 24 hours and stores the image outside the core platform Journaling protection - creates an almost live copy of your VM and records the VM data and state in a data journal Additionally, you can implement your own protection technologies. Utilising our Cloud Storage service, you can keep secondary copies of your data by: Manually copying data Using scripts to copy data Using backup applications such as CommVault, Networker and others. You can replicate data between sites for even greater data protection. Can I use my own protection client software? Yes, you simply install appropriate backup software within the VM and specify the backup location. A typical scenario might involve using a commercial backup solution (such as Symantec NetBackup, CommVault or EMC NetWorker) that points to services such as our Cloud Storage. Snapshot protection How does snapshot protection work? An automated VM snapshot creates a crash‑consistent snapshot of the VM, which is then copied to our dedicated backup system. How do I add snapshot protection to my VM? Use the UKCloud Portal to add snapshot protection to a VM: Login to the UKCloud Portal and choose the appropriate account. In the dashboard, click My VMs , then click the appropriate vOrg. Click the My VMs tab. Choose the appropriate VDC then click the VMs tab. In the Snapshot Protection column, click the Manage button. From the Select Backup Policy list, choose the policy level that you require: 14‑day or 28‑day , then click Submit . The button changes to indicate your chosen policy. You can also remove a VM from automated backups by choosing No Backup from the Select Backup Policy list. How long does it take before the first snapshot is taken? The time it takes to add snapshot protection to a VM varies depending on how many other requests are in the queue. While the request is processed, the button in the Snapshot Protection column changes to an amber Processing button. When the process has completed, the button changes back to green and will indicate the snapshot policy you chose for the VM ( 14‑day or 28‑day ). If the process fails, the button changes to a red Failed button. In this situation, contact the UKCloud support team to resolve the issue. The first snapshot will be taken in the next available backup window. Backup status information is typically updated daily on the UKCloud Portal by 10:00am, but typically within minutes of the close of the backup window. Can I change the snapshot policy for my VM at any time? Yes, there are no restrictions. After your changes have been processed, they will be applied to the snapshot taken in the next backup window. How are my automated VM snapshots restored? If you have access to the support ticketing system, you can request restoration of VMs. We'll restore the whole VM image to your virtual data centre (VDC). You can then manage the restoration of individual files or the whole VM. Do automated VM snapshots include my VDC configuration? Configuration of VDC items such as virtual firewalls, load balancers and virtual networks are backed up at a platform level, and cannot be restored on a per‑customer basis. You can create an individual backup of these items via the vCloud API. What is the automated VM snapshot frequency? Once every 24 hours. How long can I store a backup? Data is stored for 14 or 28 days, depending on the retention policy you choose. Can I set my own schedules? We do not currently support custom schedules. Can I snapshot a VM on demand? Not with the UKCloud automated VM snapshot service. If you need to snapshot autonomously, you can install your own protection service and use our Cloud Storage service. Is the automated VM snapshot backup full or incremental? We take a full automated backup of the VM. Can I recover individual files using UKCloud's automated VM snapshot backup? To restore individual files, you need to extract them from the whole VM image that we restore to a new VM. You can access the new VM, find the data you want and transfer it to the original VM. Standard charges will be incurred for the temporary VM. Can I set a global policy for all VMs within a VDC? Yes. You can apply the global policy to new VMs created in the VDC or to all new and existing VMs. For the steps required to do this, see How to manage Snapshot Protection for your VMs . Can I change the snapshot retention policy for a VM? Yes, you can use the UKCloud Portal to change the snapshot retention policy. For the steps required to do this, see How to manage Snapshot Protection for your VMs . What type of data is the automated VM snapshot backup solution suitable for? The service is suitable for data certified as OFFICIAL and OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE and is available on both UKCloud platforms: Assured OFFICIAL (formerly IL2) and Elevated OFFICIAL (formerly IL3). Do large VMs (2 TiB+) affect snapshot backups? Yes. Snapshot‑based backups are not supported for large VMs with high change rates, as the protection service will spend longer trying to establish what has changed and then attempt to back all of it up. You must take an alternative backup approach with VMs of this size. Can I restrict the automated VM snapshot backup to specific files or directories? No, this is not currently possible. You can implement your own protection solution if this is a requirement. Where is the protected data stored? By default, all snapshot backups are stored in the opposite site from the one that the VM is running in; so a VM running in Farnborough stores its snapshot in Corsham. You cannot presently request a preference to change the location. What SLA do you offer on snapshot backup success? There's currently no SLA associated with the snapshot backup service, although it is monitored 24x7. How do I restore data? You can request restoration of VMs only if you have access to the support ticketing system. To restore data, administrators can access the UKCloud Portal and, using My Calls, create a support ticket stating the VM and the backup schedule they want to restore. UKCloud operations then complete this task, restoring the entire VM image. How quickly can you restore a VM? The larger the VM, the longer the restore time: When restoring over the existing VM, restore times are reduced by the use of change block tracking. When restoring alongside an existing service, data restoration must start from scratch. Depending on the size of the VM, this can take many hours. Do I need to install any software on my VMs? The automated VM snapshot backup works directly with the cloud platform to capture the entire VM, so there is no need to install any software within the VM. If you prefer an application‑consistent backup (rather than a crash‑consistent backup), we recommend that you install VM tools and configure appropriate pre-backup and post-backup scripts. If a VM is deleted, how long will existing snapshot backups be retained? The UKCloud platform automates the deletion of backups as they reach their retention date. Therefore, 14 or 28 days after the VM is deleted, depending on your chosen profile, the last snapshot backup will automatically be removed from the platform and consequently be unavailable for restore. How and when am I notified of snapshot backup failures? Backup information, including failures, is updated daily on the UKCloud platform by 10:00am, but typically within minutes of the close of the backup window. For the steps required to access the status of a VM's snapshot backup, see How to manage Snapshot Protection for your VMs . Note that we do not presently provide real-time alerting on individual VMs. What is the process for dealing with failures? UKCloud's internal monitoring tools provide us with advanced warnings regarding any backup failures. The UKCloud support team receives a daily report of snapshot backup failures. We'll raise a service ticket on your behalf and proactively investigate with you when: Any VM has a failure count of more than two Three or more VMs within the same VDC fail within 14 days What does the proactive investigation consist of? UKCloud's proactive corrective measures depend on the nature of the snapshot backup failures, but will generally follow this outline: We evaluate snapshot backup failures and look for emerging patterns. In the case of a repetitive failure, we'll raise a service request on your behalf. We'll conduct an investigation into the snapshot backup failure, and take appropriate mitigation steps. Should the failure persist, we may suggest a customer review to try to resolve the issue. If we identify that the snapshot backup service is incompatible with your application and intended usage, we'll recommend a session with a Technical Account Manager or solution architect to work through alternative protection options. How and when are reruns scheduled? Backups are attempted during the hours of 2000 and 0800. A backup will not be reattempted in the same backup window, but will be included as normal in the next window. If a snapshot backup attempt is returned as a failure this will be reported to the UKCloud support team, and any remedial actions will be in place for the backup attempt in the next window. How is the automated VM snapshot backup service charged? The service is charged on a per VM basis based on: The size of the VM you are backing up The amount of additional data you are backing up The length of time those backups are held When I disable snapshot protection on my VM, will billing immediately stop? Billing stops immediately and you will no longer be charged regardless of the chosen retention period. In addition, you will no longer have access to any snapshots taken. If I have an existing VDC that includes snapshot protection, is protection automatically added to any new VMs I create? Yes, if the service level of your VDC includes snapshot protection (either selected for an Essential, Power or Priority VM or the former \"STANDARD\" or \"ENHANCED\"), that protection is automatically applied to any VMs you create within that VDC. You can still use the self‑service backup functionality within the UKCloud Portal to remove snapshot protection from a VM or change the retention policy without having to raise a Service Request. Can I set retention policies at a VDC level? Yes, you can set retention polices at a VDC level, meaning that all VMs within the VDC will inherit the retention policy set. What happens if I add VMs to a VDC that has a defined retention policy? All VMs that are created once a VDC policy is set will be automatically added into the protection policy. If you decide to change the VDC policy, you can choose to apply the new policy to ALL existing VMs in the VDC. Further details can be found in the Snapshot Protection Service Scope and guidance on how to apply protection to VMs and VDCs can be found in the How to manage Snapshot Protection for your VMs . Are Snapshot policies automatically applied to VMs? Protection products are not automatically applied to VMs running on the UKCloud platform, therefore you must explicitly select the protection option that best meets your requirements.

    "href": "articles/vmware/vmw-faq-journaling-protection.html",
    "title": "Journaling Protection FAQs | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Journaling Protection FAQs General What is Journaling Protection? Journaling protection (Powered by Zerto) is a powerful self-service replication and recovery tool that can improve organisational resilience. It can be accessed and controlled by using the fully-featured portal. How does it work? As indicated in the name, journaling protection utilises a \"journal\" for capturing every change that takes place inside an application. The contents of this journal are then stored in a different UKCloud Zone - which is nominated by the customer. The journal can span up to 28 days of a VMs history, with recovery points just seconds apart. Allowing for a near zero RPO. In the event of a disruption to service - either at the service provider level (loss of infrastructure), or something localised to the application (ransomware attack, problematic software upgrade). Customers can recover the VMs into their recovery site - either with minimal data loss, or to a specified point in time. How is it billed? Journaling Protection will be billed monthly in arrears and is dependent on the storage consumed, and whether virtual machines (VM) are protected on the UKCloud platform. To explain the billing of this service, please see the worked examples below: UKCloud virtual machine protection In the scenario that you are using the service to protect virtual machines on the UKCloud platform, you will be billed for: (Virtual machine cost per hour + Journaling cost per hour) * hours per month (Storage cost per month + Storage journaling cost) * Storage capacity For example: 1 Medium Power VM on the Assured platform available for 720 hours with 160GiB Tier 2 storage. As always, UKCloud include the first 60GiB of Tier 2 storage (10GiB on Micro) in the hourly price of a VM. However, any protection will apply to the base storage and any additional storage. In this example, the 60GiB + 100GiB = 160GiB. It is worth mentioning that if the base storage is upgraded to Tier 1 storage, this will be charged at the Tier 1 storage price. This would be calculated as: VM: (£0.22 + £0.10) * 720 = £230.40 Base Storage: £0.30 * 60GiB = £18.00 Additional Storage: (£0.10 + £0.30) * 100GiB = £40.00 Total: £288.40 Note, when a VM is turned off the 60GiB becomes chargeable and the customer will be billed for the total storage consumed. If the VM was turned off for the whole month, then the following calculation would apply: Storage: (£0.10 + £0.30) * 160GiB = £64 Total: £64.00 In an example where no additional storage is selected: 1 Medium Power VM on the Assured platform available for 720 hours with only the base 60GiB Tier 2 storage. This would be calculated as: VM: (£0.22 + £0.10) * 720 = £230.40 Base Storage: £0.30 * 60GiB = £18.00 Additional Storage: (£0.10 + £0.30) * 0GiB = £0.00 Total: £248.40 The charge if the VM was turned off for the whole month: Storage: (£0.10 + £0.30) * 60GiB = £24.00 Total: £24.00 What functionality is available? Currently, you can carry out the following actions using Journaling Protection: Define Virtual Protection Groups (VPGs) which map to one or more vApp. These will allow you to maintain a set of rules that will apply to all VMs within the VPG. Rules include settings such as the journaling location and network mapping State a desired location that the VM journal is to be stored in (for example, another UKCloud region) View the current RPO and RTO (recovery point objective) or RTO (recovery time objectives) are for their protected VMs. Self-service restore vApps from a journal via the portal from any point contained within the journal View real-time notifications within the Zerto portal to check if VMs are not meeting RPO or RTO targets Perform disaster recovery tests by recovering vApps into the recovery destination Can I set different retention policies for my vApps? Yes. Each vApp maps to a VPG, and each VPG can have its own retention policy. For example, you may have one VPG retention policy set at 2-day Journaling and another VPG retention policy set at 7-day Journaling. Is this a managed service? No. UKCloud have implemented Journaling Protection to be available for UKCloud for VMware workloads as an on-platform service and will ensure that the service is available and updated accordingly. Once the service has been available for your workloads, you will be responsible for managing the service via the UKCloud or Journaling Protection portal (powered by Zerto). How do I make changes to my Journaling Protection? Once the service has been provisioned for your environment, you will be able to log into the UKCloud Portal and then log into the Journaling Protection portal. Please note that our support teams will be unable to manage your service for you as this is provided unmanaged. How does this differ from Snapshot Protection? The Journaling Protection service provides a continuous log of all the changes that have occurred within your environment within the specified time frame (2, 7, 14 or 28 days) that are stored on the UKCloud platform and can be restored quickly and easily from a point in time of your choosing. Snapshot protection utilises 24 hour backups for up to 28 days which are stored on a separate storage solution, and can recover from deleted disks or VMs. In the event that you need to recover from a previous recovery point, there may be a loss of data due to the time difference between the event and the last snapshot. Will I be able to extend my retention periods by moving my journals to external storage, such as Cloud Storage? No. In the initial release, this feature will not be enabled as we have identified a security challenge that must be addressed. Will my network configuration be failed over in the event of disaster? Journaling Protection (powered by Zerto) will replicate vApp networking specific to a customer's vApp. However, organisation and external networking configuration would need to be done manually. Customers can do this ahead of any failure by pre-provisioning external connectivity within the recovery site. During setup for the DR site, is there a way to export the edge and vLAN configurations from the production site and import this configuration for the DR site? Yes. You can manage exports and imports of configurations via the API. You may also raise a support ticket and we will be able to assist with this process. Does the Journaling Protection swap drive work for bitlocker enabled drives? Swap disks are synchronised during the initial synchronisation, but no further ongoing synchronisation occurs. This means that the Bitlocker drive should remain encrypted and configured when failed over. However, if the password or key is modified then it will need to be reconfigured or re-encrypted in the event of a failover. To avoid this scenario, customers are advised to leave the Bitlocker drive marked as normal synchronisation (non-swap). Does UKCloud offer an SLA with Journaling Protection? We do not currently plan to offer an SLA around the service. However, the real time monitoring available in the Journaling Protection portal (powered by Zerto) will advise customers of the state of their journal and their currently achievable RPO. Is Zerto licensing included? Yes, it is included with the Journaling Protection option for use with the 2, 7, 14 day or 28 day retention policies. Will a VPG still be protected if one or more VMs are powered off? In normal circumstances, if a VM within a VPG is powered off this will not impact the protection as remaining powered-on VMs will continue to replicate as normal. This includes the scenario when a new VM is added to a VPG and the new VM is in powered off state - in this instance the VM would need to be powered on to create its initial sync, and existing VMs will continue to replicate as normal. The one exception to this is if you have an existing VPG, and one VM is powered off, and at some point afterwards the VPG goes in a bitmap / delta sync (normally due to network contention or high periods of writes on a protected VM). In this case, the powered-off VM prevents the VPG from completing the sync and the VPG replication will be halted; this will trigger an alert within the Zerto portal. Is Journaling Protection enabled in all regions? Journaling Protection is currently enabled in all regions. However, only regions 5 and 6 are used as the recovery destination regions due to performance and capacity management reasons. In order to check the latest status as to what services are available in each region, please check UKCloud services by region . Can I use Journaling Protection with VDCs that are in the same data centre? Yes, this is possible but dependent on which regions the VDCs are in. It is not possible to use regions 1, 2, 7 or 8 as the recovery destination regions for the journal. Can I use Journaling Protection to migrate workloads between regions? Yes, you can use our Journaling Protection solution to migrate your UKCloud for VMware applications into another VMware-enabled region. This enables you to move your workloads into the regions within our platform that are best suited for your requirements. The migration of VMs within our platform is very closely aligned with how we operate the Journaling Protection of VMs, with the only difference being that when you have failed-over the VMs to another region you do not then failback to the primary region. As migrating workloads involves enabling Journaling Protection on your source VMs, those VMs (and any associated storage) will incur the appropriate additional Journaling Protection charges for the duration of the migration. Once your migration is complete, you should be sure to remove the original VMs from the source site to avoid additional charges.

    "title": "Service failover testing FAQs | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Service failover testing FAQs General How can I test that my services will failover? You can test the failover function of the service by requesting a Test Scenario from UKCloud. The Test Scenario is designed for the following uses: Customers that wish to test and understand how their applications might react in a failover where the underlying physical hosts have failed (simulated in the scenario) or when the VMs have been migrated in a live state. The Test Scenario is not: A customisable feature of UKCloud for VMware. This Test Scenario Service is limited by the following rules: UKCloud will only complete a test scenario for a maximum of 10 customer identified VMs. This provides you with an experience similar to what you would experience in a live fail over scenario. Test Scenarios will only occur during office hours. Customers will build and explicitly identify up to 10 VMs to UKCloud. The failover will be deemed a success by UKCloud once we can identify that the VMs are running in the second UKCloud data centre using its own monitors and tools. What is not included? UKCloud will not failover the connectivity and physical firewall during a test failover. You will experience a network latency of a few milliseconds through this firewall. What is the process to initiate a Test Scenario? Customer raises a Support Request indicating they wish to complete this test and confirming the VMs (up to 10) that they wish to be failed over, the start and end time, and any other requirements. UKCloud receives the request and responds accordingly with an accept or reject. If accepted, UKCloud will schedule the work to commence at the specified time. What options are there? Option 1: UKCloud will dynamically move customer VMs between two data centres UKCloud will dynamically move customer VMs between the data centres while the VMs remain online. There will be increased network latency between client VMs that are running in the different data centres (approximately 4-4.5 msec). Option 2: UKCloud will restart customer VMs between the two data centres Customer VMs can be shut down and restarted in the secondary datacentre. If the shutdown is a non-graceful (Power-Off as opposed to a Guest OS shutdown) then this simulates the effect of a physical server outage from an individual VM perspective. This is the equivalent of a total data centre failure. As the UKCloud platform is multi-tenanted, UKCloud will not replicate a physical host failure to invoke a DR scenario as this may impact other customers. Failovers will last a maximum of 12 hours before being failed back to the originating data centre. What outputs are available? It's highly likely that the testing of a failover will be seamless to the customer and therefore it will be difficult for them to gauge that the failover has occurred. To provide assurance that the test was successful, UKCloud will produce a report that identifies the following: A sanitised (removing ESX host names) report of the ESX servers that the VMs are located on during the period of the failover test Comments and observations Are there charges for a service failover test? Typically, UKCloud will only allow a test to last for 1 business day with a charge (based on the SFIA rate card - level 3 Apply). If you require longer testing periods, this needs to be approved by UKCloud. Why is the DR failover Test Scenario not fully automatic and self service? This is part of the service roadmap.

    "keywords": "Data Transfer Facility Service Scope About this document This document explains what is and isn't included in the scope of this service. About the Data Transfer Facility Our Data Transfer Facility enables customers to use the secure network connections at our Farnborough office to manage systems or transfer data into or out of their environments. It's useful if, for example, you don't have enough network bandwidth, or you're waiting for appropriately accredited connectivity to be installed. If you want to bring in more than 500GiB of VMs, we also offer a Mass Transfer facility, see the appropriate Service Scope for NAS or HDD . Booking and booking conditions To use the Data Transfer Facility, you need to book. The first step is to raise a service request through the UKCloud Portal. The Data Transfer Facility is available on a whole-day basis, between 0900 and 1700 on normal business days. The minimum booking period is one day at a cost of £500 per day. A maximum of 2 workstations are available allowing for 2 concurrent users. The person nominated to carry out the activity must: Understand your environment Have a plan of action Have the permissions to execute the plan And if supported by a partner - a technically competent consultant You are responsible for sizing the amount of time needed to transfer your data. Data transfers can't be left to run over night. You will be billed for use of the facility on your next monthly statement. You can cancel your booking, but we reserve the right to charge for cancellations made less than 24 hours before the start of the booking period. If a third party is to carry out the work on your behalf, you must give us appropriate authorisation in advance. Third parties cannot book the Data Transfer Facility themselves - you must initiate the request. Before your visit As the UKCloud office is on a secure site, you need to book with at least 48 hours' notice. If you're a non-UK national, you need to give us at least 21 days' notice. You need to bring a valid form of photo ID with you - a passport or driving licence. If you bring an encrypted drive with you, this must be a hardware encrypted drive only. You are not allowed to bring a software encrypted drive, as installation of non-UKCloud software is not authorised. If you intend to bring your own devices with you to use in the Data Transfer Facility, you must complete the SIRO approval form . During your visit You'll be notified of your UKCloud contact before your visit to the site, so please ask for them at reception when you arrive. You'll need to sign in. We'll give you a red 'Escorted' badge, and you'll be escorted round the site by your UKCloud contact. You'll have access to a PC connected to our Assured or Elevated platform, as specified when you book. It's expected that you or a third party working on your behalf will be able to complete the data transfer or system management activities without any help from UKCloud. To help make your day comfortable, the Data Transfer Facility has: An Xbox One - you can bring your own compatible games Tea and coffee making facilities, a microwave and a fridge in the kitchen next door Wifi internet access You won't be able to leave the site for lunch, so you should either bring your own or ask your UKCloud contact to take you to the onsite café where a variety of food and refreshments are on sale. The onsite ATM accepts all major bank cards. You can leave the Data Transfer Facility to use the kitchen or restrooms by the main reception area. However, you cannot leave that area, move about the office or go into any other offices unless you're escorted by your UKCloud contact. At the end of your visit At the end of your visit we'll re-image the PC you've been using to remove any data you stored on it. Supported media and connectivity You can use the following media for data upload: External hard drive - either unencrypted or hardware encrypted only CD DVD USB pen drive - either unencrypted or hardware encrypted only NAS Data can be connected via the following interfaces: USB1/2/3 1Gb Ethernet port Supported file systems: External hard drive - NTFS CD/DVD CD-R, finalised CD-RW DVD-R, DVD+R, finalised DVD-RW, finalised DVD+RW USB pen drive FAT/FAT32, NTFS NAS Must support Windows shares Supported virtual machine (VM) formats: OVF (vCloud and vCenter) OVA (vCloud and vCenter) Hardware version: <=9 Disk format: thick, thin Maximum single VM size: 1.5TB If your VMs are in a different format, you can use the OVF Tool and VMware vCenter Converter to upload them. Supported network ports and protocols To maintain a secure infrastructure, we whitelist a set of ports that can be used to transfer data. If you want to use ports outside of this range, you need to make a request before you use the Data Transfer Facility. Inbound ports TCP ports UDP ports VPN ports SSH - 22 DNS - 53 AH SMTP - 25 ESP HTTP - 80 and 8080 IPsec - UDP 4500 HTTPS - 443, 444 and 8443 ISAKMP --- UDP 500 Secure SMTP - 465 FTPS (Control) - 990 IMAPS - 993 POP3S - 995 Outbound ports TCP ports UDP ports VPN ports SSH - 22 DNS --- 53 AH SMTP - 25 NTP - 123 ESP HTTP -80 and 8080 IPsec - UDP 4500 HTTPS - 443, 444 and 8443 ISAKMP - UDP 500 Secure SMTP - 465 FTPS (Data) - 989 Connectivity By default the Assured data upload PC is connected to your environment's internet gateway. You can connect from the PC to an external IP in your environment. The IP address of the data upload pc can be added to a firewall rule in your environment to secure access Access to environments on other networks (e.g HSCN or PSN) will require additional configuration. Please discuss this with your Cloud Delivery Manager or TAM if required Platform performance The speed of data transfer to the UKCloud platform isn't guaranteed. However, during tests of the upload and download speeds, an average of 8 Mbit/s was achieved for VM import/export and 40 Mbit/s for data transferred over FTPS. For a transfer time calculator, go to http://techinternets.com/copy_calc?do . If you use FTPS to upload data to or download it from your environment, you can transfer up to 1TB of data in a day. Anticipated transfer speeds Transfer speeds will vary based on a number of factors such as the protocol being used or the system being targeted. The following table can help you calculate the time required to upload data based on estimated speeds derived from our testing and simulations: Upload type Protocol Estimated transfer speed vCloud VM import SSL 8 Mbit/s vCloud data store file upload SSL 8 Mbit/s vCloud multi-threaded upload SSL 16 Mbit/s File upload to virtual machine SCP 20 Mbit/s FTPS 40 Mbit/s FTP 40 Mbit/s If the Data Transfer Facility doesn't provide the performance you need, you can engage a Cloud Architect to discuss other options. For more information on using multi-threaded uploads, visit the Knowledge Centre. Software We provide PC images running Windows 7 with the following pre-installed software: Firefox web browser v38.0 PuTTY v0.64 PuTTY gen v0.64 FileZilla v3.11.0-rc1 WinSCP v5.7.3 7-ZIP v9.2.0 Java v8 Update 45 vCloud Director Client Integration plugin v5.5.0 VM Power CLI v6.0 R1 VMware OVF Tool v4.1.0 Python v2.7.6 EMC Geodrive v1.3 Atmos Fox v1.5 Rest Client for vCloud Director API access v2.0.3 Technical support If you experience a technical issue during your visit, please raise this with your UKCloud contact.

    "title": "Private Cloud for Storage FAQs | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Private Cloud for Storage FAQs Service What is the service? Private Cloud for Storage provides single-tenant storage Infrastructure as a Service. Your data is hosted in one of our UK data centres; or in your Crown Hosting Data Centre (CHDC). How does Private Cloud for Storage differ from UKCloud's Cloud Storage? The Platform Only package in Private Cloud for Storage provides you with the underlying Assured Cloud platform to host and manage dedicated storage hardware. You can arrange your own purchase of it, or UKCloud can broker it for you. This service differs from Cloud Storage in that it allows you to purchase in bulk up front, to reduce the price per GiB. What backup/disaster recovery options do I get? You can choose between two protection levels: STANDARD provides protection in one data centre ENHANCED provides remote protection in our second data centre Where will my data be physically stored? Your data will be stored in our highly resilient, UK-sovereign tier 3 data centres, which are separated by over 100km. How much data can I store? A core benefit of Private Cloud for Storage is that it can scale to meet the most demanding storage requirements. What network protocols are supported on the platform? There is native support for a wide variety of network protocols including SMB/CIFS, NFS, HTTP and, optionally, HDFS. Management How do I access the platform? Documentation on ways to interact with the platform is available from the UKCloud Portal Knowledge Centre. What software tools are available? Advanced software features for Private Cloud for Storage include auto-tiering, deduplication, retention, replication, quotas and snapshots. Support How do I raise a support ticket? UKCloud's secure online Portal provides the most common service management functionality. Alternatively, you can contact support by phone or email. How do I manage my services? Private Cloud for Storage on the Assured OFFICIAL (formerly IL2) domain can be managed over the internet (or other connectivity) by raising a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. For the Elevated OFFICIAL (formerly IL3) domain, the security requirements are much stricter and require either a PSN-approved connection, UKCloud Secure Remote Access, or CAPS-approved encryption. What are your service maintenance windows? As far as possible, planned maintenance of UKCloud's infrastructure takes place between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Sunday, or between the hours of 08:00 and 12:00 (UK local time) on a Saturday or Sunday. We provide customers with at least 14 days' advance notice of planned maintenance. As far as possible, emergency maintenance of UKCloud's infrastructure takes place between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Sunday, or between the hours of 08:00 and 12:00 (UK local time) on Saturday or Sunday, unless there is an identified and demonstrable immediate risk to a customer's environment. Whenever possible, we provide customers with at least six hours' advance notice of emergency maintenance. Onboarding How can I get started with the service? On acceptance of your order, we'll work with you to create a detailed design for your Private Cloud for Storage service. The design will formalise the dedicated components required for the solution, including storage hardware, storage software, network hardware and cables. If this is a new service for you, we will create your primary administrator account and send you a welcome pack, which includes the URL for the UKCloud Portal for access to the Knowledge Centre and service management function. Billing and legal What is the smallest unit of time I will be billed for? Billing depends on the packaging option chosen. The smallest unit of time you will be billed for this service is monthly. Private Cloud for Storage is offered under a 24-month minimum term commitment. How can I pay for the services? Service charges are billed monthly in arrears. In addition, there will be initial upfront charges, which vary depending on the pricing model selected. Payment can be made by direct bank transfer (BACS/CHAPS). How can I view billing information? Billing information is available via the UKCloud Portal. What are the termination fees? An early exit charge will be payable if the contract is terminated before the end of its original term. You are responsible for extracting their data from the platform if required. UKCloud may make an additional charge for transferring data out of the service. Is there a free trial? Owing to the dedicated, single-tenant nature of this service, no trials are available. Security What data is suitable for your cloud? This service is hosted in the UK and operated by SC-cleared staff. It has extensive independent validation (including CESG design reviews) that it is fully aligned with the 14 NCSC Cloud Security Principles, and is therefore ideal for all data classified at OFFICIAL (including OFFICIAL SENSITIVE) and legacy IL0--IL4 solutions. Can systems on different UKCloud platforms communicate with one another? UKCloud's Cross Domain Security Zone allows you to use the UKCloud-defined and managed UKCloud Guard, or a customer-designed and managed Walled Garden, to enable communication between platforms.

    "keywords": "UKCloud for Oracle Software Service Scope About this document This document describes the boundaries of the UKCloud for Oracle software service, along with the division of responsibilities between UKCloud and the customer, to facilitate the provisioning and ongoing use of the service. About UKCloud for Oracle Software The UKCloud for Oracle Software service provides a secure, scalable and cost-effective platform for hosting Oracle virtual machines (OVMs) of various sizes. You can use the platform to build new services quickly and securely; and migrate, augment or transform existing Oracle-based applications. The platform is immediately available so you can provision and scale OVMs in minutes. Service architecture Your UKCloud service architecture is as follows: Company. Your contract with UKCloud is associated with a company, which provides a single owner for the contract, regardless of how many accounts are created. Account. We use accounts to separate financial ownership. An account could represent an organisation, a customer contract, or a specific project. An account can also have several UKCloud services associated with it, such as UKCloud for Oracle, Cloud Storage and UKCloud for OpenStack. You can also use accounts to separate users based on access requirements or permissions. Organisation. This represents your UKCloud for Oracle Software service inside Oracle Enterprise Manager and on the UKCloud Portal. There is a 1:1 mapping of service to Organisation. Oracle Tenant. An Oracle Tenant is where you define your workload type and build your OVMs. You can create Oracle Tenants via a service request. Service configuration The UKCloud for Oracle Software infrastructure is uncontended and configured to optimise the performance and availability of Oracle workloads. There is only one service configuration on the UKCloud for Oracle Software platform, ensuring that OVMs are pinned to cores to stop OVM movement that would unbalance applications. Customers can self-configure OVMs by the number of cores, and amount of memory and storage needed. OVMs can be reconfigured to adjust resources in line with changing performance requirements. Self-service management is done through the Oracle Enterprise Management Portal, accessed through the UKCloud Portal. Full details of the available service options are outlined in the Service Definition . Storage options All storage is persistent and resilient to local hardware failures. Multiple storage options can be used to support different aspects of the application. Tier 1. Fast storage ideal for data warehouses, fast transactional databases or randomly executing workloads. Tier 2. General all-purpose storage, suitable for systems with human interactions or predictable work patterns. Cloud Storage. Ideal for serving media content or as a medium-term repository; can be used to store Recovery Manager (RMAN) backups. Storage policies We provide you with access to two storage policies: tier 1 and tier 2. We will initially provide you with a tier 2 storage policy, however you can request tier 1 storage be added to your Oracle Tenant so you can create additional disks with tier 1 storage on your OVMs. VM templates come with a 50GiB system disk and a secondary disk (equivalent to the size of the RAM associated with the OVM - up to 16GiB). These virtual disks are mapped from the tier 2 VM repository by default. For installations of Oracle apps on top of the OS, it's best to have separate non-OS virtual disks which are then mapped to mountpoints. The sizing requirements/recommendations for the non-OS storage can be found on the official Oracle installation guides and they can differ from version to version. You'll need to take into consideration future data growth while planning capacity, as this would also reflect on the capacity required for backups. We do not guarantee storage performance, as it can be affected by many factors. We do not provide IOPS figures for our storage offerings. Workloads can use multiple storage profiles. Protection UKCloud for Oracle Software does not include any infrastructure-level backup or disaster recovery functionality. However, the underpinning infrastructure supports native Oracle protection technologies such as Data Guard and RMAN. UKCloud's Cloud Storage can be used as an S3-addressable target for Oracle protection technologies. Service availability UKCloud for Oracle Software offers an SLA guarantee of 99.95% availability. You are entitled to claim Service Credits for outages to services that take you out of the SLA. For more about how we calculate SLAs, see the SLA Definition document. Our SLA does not cover faults within your control, such as client application issues, or faults within external connectivity providers (for example, internet, PSN or HSCN). Service background UKCloud for Oracle Software is underpinned by Oracle compute infrastructure. UKCloud manage the physical infrastructure and utilise our partner, Infomentum, to provide support and management from the hypervisor level and above. Infomentum will provision your Oracle Tenant environment and UKCloud will present it to you through the Oracle Enterprise Manager. You will be responsible for OVM creation and maintenance. All service requests will be triaged by UKCloud. We reserve the right to escalate a request to Infomentum for support. If you have not have a managed service contract with Infomentum, please do not contact them directly. UKCloud actively capacity-manages the cloud platform to ensure you have access to the resources you request. The UKCloud platform is designed using sites, regions and zones. The relationship between them is shown below: You can specify Farnborough or Corsham as the site where you would like to have your service provisioned, and we will try to accommodate requests and will advise you if we are unable do so. We control the deployed versions of technology on the platform. This covers internal platform-supporting technologies, and any technology versions available to you. Internally this includes, but isn't limited to, the Oracle Virtual Machine Manager and Oracle Virtual Machine Server versions, and the hardware version of the platform. Externally this includes the available versions of the edge gateway and Oracle Enterprise Manager. You can make additional configurations inside an OVM (such as implementing third-party software technologies). We do not support customer implementations inside a VM. Operating systems UKCloud for Oracle Software includes the base OVM platform licences, which provide VM containers that meet Oracle's definition of hard partitioning. Our service does not include licences for the Oracle applications and databases you choose to run. As the underlying platform is powered by OVM technology, you can either transfer your existing licences, or purchase new licences based on the quantity of virtual processors (cores) you allocate within each VM. Please note that UKCloud does not have the functionality to provide Oracle licensing, and this must be sourced via an appropriate partner. 'Cores' refers to OVM vCPUs pinned to physical processor cores (excluding hyper-threading). Your Oracle licensing will be based on the cores consumed by your OVM. Update services. We make update repositories available for OVM containers. We don't provide software update facilities for non-UKCloud licensed software, including all Oracle applications. Anti-virus. We do not provide anti-virus software as part of the service. Networks Internet-facing solutions. You are provided with 2 usable public IP addresses, but you can ask for additional public IP addresses via a Service Request. We reserve the right to decline the request if you have spare capacity in your existing deployment. PSN-facing solutions. You should raise a Service Request or contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM) to be assigned your IP address. This solution also comes with contended bandwidth (uncapped). Janet and HSCN solutions. You have one usable IP address, but you can request additional IP addresses via a Service Request. UKCloud for Oracle Software does not have a native external connectivity functionality. Therefore, UKCloud have enabled customers to manage connectivity rules, such as firewall, IPsec VPN and NAT functionality, through a VMware edge gateway. This edge is provisioned within the UKCloud for VMware environment and is managed using either the UKCloud Portal GUI or API. This edge can be an existing edge in a customer's UKCloud for VMware environment, or can be provisioned as a completely new entity, specific for Oracle. Edge gateway By default, we assign one edge gateway per connectivity type. You can choose which external network you would like to enable your Oracle environment to connect to. Note that the Oracle environment does not have to connect to an external network, however an external network will need to be connected to the edge. Site-to-site IPsec VPN. You can create IPsec VPN tunnels to connect different environments, both internal and external, to UKCloud. There is a limit of 64 tunnels per edge gateway. Bring Your Own Firewall Bring Your Own Firewall is currently not available for UKCloud for Oracle Software installations; however, you can have BYOF within UKCloud for VMware and connect it to the UKCloud for Oracle Software edge gateway via an IPsec VPN. Protective monitoring We have implemented GPG 13-aligned Protective Monitoring across the Assured and Elevated platforms at the hypervisor level and below. We don't provide Protective Monitoring services above the hypervisor (for example, for your VM). Components above this infrastructure are your own responsibility to provide an appropriate protective monitoring capability. In line with UKCloud's System Interconnect and Security Policy (SISP), we provide notification of customer-impacting security incidents. It is your responsibility to report similar incidents to us. Platform management Users can access, manage and view the UKCloud for Oracle Software service, accessing only those features allowed by their role, in any of the following ways: Oracle Enterprise Manager. The graphical interface for the creation and management of the Oracle environment. vCloud Director API. Enables the programmatic creation and management of the Oracle edge gateway. vCloud Director graphical UI. Provides a graphical interface to access the vCloud Director environment to manage the Oracle edge gateway (depending on assigned permissions). UKCloud Portal. Enables the creation of Oracle compute services and edge gateways. The Portal also includes an overview of actual and estimated spend, along with service configuration information. Access to service reporting and incident and request management is also possible through the Portal. You cannot access the underlying infrastructure. This includes (but isn't limited to) the hardware and the Oracle Virtual Machine Manager environment. Service migration UKCloud do not currently provide migration services, however customers are free to bring their own migration tools and utilise them within the UKCloud for Oracle Software environment. Service reporting Visibility. We provide a monthly service report via the UKCloud Portal. This includes a summary of platform availability and a retrospective of the interactions with UKCloud support during the previous month. Maintenance notifications and Service Status reports are also delivered through the portal. Service reporting. All service reporting is done via the UKCloud Portal. Billing. Billing is issued on a monthly basis where you will be billed for your total monthly consumption. Customer service Customer Success Manager (CSM). For the first 90 days of the service, you have access to a UKCloud CSM who will help you with your adoption of the UKCloud UKCloud for Oracle Software service. This includes finding relevant systems and how to use UKCloud tools and processes. Cloud Architects. UKCloud Cloud Architects support you during the design of solutions for the cloud platform. UKCloud Cloud Architects are ideally placed to help reconcile your requirements with the UKCloud platform. We recommend engagement with a Cloud Architect when implementing Oracle solutions. Technical Account Managers (TAM). You will be allocated with an assigned point of contact who will provide ongoing assistance with reporting and incident escalation. Support. After the initial on-boarding and design phase, you can utilise the standard UKCloud support entitlement, which is documented in the Customer Engagement Factsheet . Customer responsibilities You are responsible for assessing whether the UKCloud UKCloud for Oracle Software platform can support the various requirements of your application. The control and management of access and responsibilities for end users including appropriate connectivity, security and accreditation if required. If access is required over government secure networks (HSCN, Janet, RLI or PSN), you are responsible for adhering to the relevant Code of Connection (CoCo) and for providing evidence of their CoCo to UKCloud upon request. UKCloud is unable to provide access to secure networks where such evidence has not been provided. Management and administration of layers above the Oracle hypervisor (OS patching, application performance monitoring, user administration). You are also responsible for ensuring only lawful data that supports the UK public sector is stored and processed by applications on this environment, and that they fully comply with the UKCloud Security Operating Procedures (SyOPs) and other information assurance requirements as specified in the UKCloud SISP and associated accreditation documentation sets. Service provisioning Within 4 hours of accepting an order (shorter deployment times are typically achieved and can be prioritised upon request), UKCloud will create the customer's Primary Administrator account and send a welcome pack which includes the URL for the UKCloud Customer Portal, and the getting started guide. UKCloud and Infomentum will provision the Oracle Tenant environment. UKCloud will request information such as private subnets before creating the environment. Once the build is complete, UKCloud will provide you with access to provision Oracle virtual machines and Oracle networks. UKCloud has created several videos, help guides, manuals and FAQs to help train and instruct users so that they are up and running quickly and easily. These are available within the UKCloud Knowledge Centre . In addition, you will be assigned a Customer Success Manager (CSM) to provide any assistance required during the first 90 days of the service. UKCloud also has a large ecosystem of partners who can deliver additional services, such as support and professional services. UKCloud would be pleased to introduce you to the right partner to suit your needs. Service constraints UKCloud will adhere to the following in terms of maintenance windows: \"Planned Maintenance\" means any pre-planned disruptive maintenance to any of the infrastructure relating to the service. Planned Maintenance activity may result in periods of degradation or loss of availability depending on the nature of the activity required. In such cases, if you will be affected then UKCloud shall provide you with at least fourteen (14) days' notice of the Planned Maintenance. If during Planned Maintenance there is a loss of availability outside the scope described in the planned maintenance notification to the service, an SLA event will be triggered. For OVMs, this time will be excluded from the availability calculation but will be included in monthly service reporting related to the service. \"Emergency Maintenance\" means any urgent maintenance required to prevent or mitigate against any event compromising the infrastructure relating to the service. Whenever possible, UKCloud will: a) provide affected customers with at least six (6) hours' advanced notice and; b) carry out the emergency maintenance between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Friday or between the hours of Saturday 00:00 to 06:00 (UK local time) on Monday, (including bank holidays) unless there is an identified and demonstrable immediate risk to customer environment(s). Emergency Maintenance may result in periods of degradation or loss of availability depending on the nature of the activity required. If during Emergency Maintenance there is a loss of availability to the service, an SLA event will be triggered. This time will be excluded from the availability calculation but will be included in monthly service reporting related to the service.

    "keywords": "VM compatibility with UKCloud for Oracle Software Introduction This article outlines what you need to do to make sure your Oracle VMs (OVMs) are compatible with UKCloud for Oracle Software service. You may find this useful if you're moving VMs from UKCloud for VMware to UKCloud for Oracle Software. OVF and VMDK OVF and VMDK files are not compatible with Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM), the management plane that's used to deploy and manage your UKCloud for Oracle Software environment. To make sure your VMs are compatible with UKCloud for Oracle Software you may need to transform your VMs. OVA files (Assembly option) and tar.gz/tgz (Template option) are the only accepted file formats. OVA If you select the Assembly option on the upload page, then the uploader will expect an OVA Assembly package file ( ova file). Your .ova file should contain the following files (in the exact order listed): MyVM .ovf - the OVF descriptor file, which contains all VM specs metadata and links to the embedded virtual disk image file (with a .vmdk extension) MyVM .mf - contains metadata that is used for integrity and authenticity checks; this data must be correct for the .ova file to be accepted in most cases MyVM .vmdk - the embedded virtual disk image file As the exported .ova file also contains file hashes that are unique to the files included in the package, simply creating a tar file with these contents will not work in most cases. For most virtualisation platforms, it's best to use the export functionality from the source virtualisation platform to generate the .ova file. One way of converting your VMs to an .ova file would be to use the OVF Tool, for example: ovftool \"original.ovf\" \"original.ova\" Tip Make sure you include the quotation marks ( \" ). You can download the OVF Tool from: https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/details?downloadGroup=OVFTOOL400&productId=353 TAR If you select the Template option on the upload page, then the uploader will expect an Oracle VM Template file (either a .tgz or .tar.gz file). This gzipped tarball file normally contains the following files (in the exact order listed): MyVM .cfg - contains the VM specs metadata and links to the embedded RAW disk image file, normally named system.img system.img - the embedded RAW disk image file, either exported from another XEN platform or converted from other virtual disk formats Upload size For any uploads larger than 500 MB, you'll need to allow sufficient time for the upload to complete before clicking the Upload button or it will fail and the item will not appear in your software library. There is currently no upload progress indicator on OEM. Oracle is aware of this but are treating it as an enhancement request therefore there's currently no indication of when the upload progress indicator will be added on future releases of the platform software.

    "title": "Oracle licensing on the UKCloud platform | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Oracle licensing on the UKCloud platform Overview Due to the licensing rules regarding Oracle, it is not possible to install and run Oracle software on the UKCloud public cloud platform. However, there are currently two ways for customers to install and run Oracle software with UKCloud: Private Cloud for Compute . This is a dedicated hardware solution that limits the number of cores, RAM and storage that would require Oracle licensing. Note that this may not be financially efficient for all customers, and this will be a bare metal environment that has not been prepared for Oracle. UKCloud for Oracle Software . This is a solution specifically designed to host Oracle solutions on a separate platform. This enables Oracle licensing to be used correctly, and is also financially efficient. The remainder of this article is regarding general Oracle licensing. Important Licensing rules from vendors such as Oracle can change frequently and so customers should validate their specific requirement with Oracle at the time of ordering. This information is correct as of June 2015. For customers wishing to licence Oracle software on virtual machines within the UKCloud platform, there are some important issues to consider with regards to the four licensing options available which are described below. Named User By implementing this licensing option, the customer can run as many Oracle servers as they want for a fixed fee ‘per named user’. As this licence model is independent of the size or number of servers, it is preferable for use in multi-tenant cloud environments such as the UKCloud platform. UKCloud appreciate that this solution may not be valid for customers that already have ‘per processor” licensing. Per Processor This type of licence allows the customer to have as many users as they need for a fixed cost ‘per processor’ that the servers run on. In a traditional physical or virtualised estate, it is possible to isolate a small subset of the overall physical servers to specifically run Oracle. In this way, only those specific servers need to be licensed for Oracle. In most multi-tenant cloud environments such as the UKCloud platform, the per processor virtual machines can run on any physical server and so, practically, Oracle requires all of those servers to be licensed – which is simply not cost effective. Oracle software within a cloud based environment can also be licensed via the per-processor option if the cloud environment is running Oracle Virtual Machine (OVM) as the hypervisor. However, due to the design of the cloud environment, this is not something UKCloud can provide or support. Oracle has negotiated an agreement with a few public cloud providers (at the time of writing, only Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure) to allow customers to license only specific host servers, but this is not yet a widely available licensing agreement. Dedicated Compute platform Customers can take advantage of the 'per processor' licensing model, by using the UKCloud Dedicated Compute platform which will provide the customer with a set hardware configuration. The Dedicated Compute option enables a customer to specify a dedicated hardware cluster of a certain number of physical servers, and this option can help customers who need more certainty as to the configuration and capacity of the cluster which underpins part of their application, whilst being also able to accommodate the compromises of having a dedicated cluster with regards to reduced levels of agility and flexibility. Application Specific Full Use Licensing An Application Specific Full Use (ASFU) licence is a restricted type of licence sold by a Solution Provider in conjunction with its third-party Application Package. For example, you can buy an ASFU licence from SAP AG to use Oracle with the SAP/R3 system. This licence would then be application specific and cannot be used for anything else. Embedded Software License An Embedded Software License (ESL) is a very restrictive licence type available from Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) who embed Oracle technology into their product. An end-user may not even be aware that the software package contains Oracle technology and should not be able to access it directly as a developer or system administrator. An example of this licensing model in use may be a Point of Sale system that requires a database to log transactions. Note The ASFU and ESL licensing options are outside the scope of UKCloud control.

    "keywords": "Internet - permitted standard ports in regions 1 and 2 Overview For UKCloud regions 1 and 2, we consulted with NCSC and the Pan Government Accreditor and agreed a policy to maintain a whitelist of common ports that are open as standard on the platform, and allow interoperability between tenants in accordance with this whitelist. You still need to enable access on your own edge gateway firewall to allow access, but this avoids having to request UKCloud to make similar changes. Note In regions 5 and 6, there is no whitelist of common ports: all ports are open. The security of your estate is your responsibility and we highly recommend that you review your edge gateway configuration, regardless of the region in which it is located, to verify that the access controls in place are in accordance with your own required security policy. We also recommend that you do not disable your firewall, even in test environments. This whitelist policy applies to the Assured OFFICIAL security domain only, where connectivity is established using internet routable addresses and where access is to and from the internet or other customers on the UKCloud platform. Other whitelists are maintained for other connectivity types. The Elevated OFFICIAL security domain is completely locked down by default with no ports open by default. If you require access outside of the standard whitelist, you can request this via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. The following diagram shows the status of standard internet ports. The permitted ports are also listed in the sections below.

    "title": "PSN connectivity FAQs | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "PSN connectivity FAQs General What is PSN? The Public Services Network (PSN) is the government's high-performance network, which helps public sector organisations work together, reduce duplication and share resources. What is the difference between PSN Assured and PSN Protected? PSN Assured carries non-encrypted traffic at the network and application layers, whereas PSN Protected carries traffic that contains a shared IPsec encrypted overlay. Who is entitled to connect to the PSN network? Any organisation that is approved by the PSN can connect. If you want PSN connectivity, you must have proven to the PSN that your infrastructure is sufficiently secure to connect to or be consumed via the PSN. This means that you must have successfully completed the process of obtaining a PSN Code of Connection (CoCo). In addition, if you're a partner selling a managed service over the PSN connectivity, you must either: Have your own PSN CoCo and PSN Code of Practice (CoP) in place, or Have specific agreement from the data‑owning end customer that you are authorised to be covered by the customer's CoCo You can find more details here . How do I apply for a PSN CoCo? You can apply for your PSN CoCo via the following links: PSN Service Provision Compliance Certificate PSN Connection Compliance Certificate How do I apply for a PSN CoP? You must have a CoCo before you can apply for a CoP and list the UKCloud Service Numbers in your application. For the current CoP application form, click here . You must have your CoP in place before we can accept your order. What are UKCloud's PSN service numbers? Click here for a list of our PSN approved services. Do you have any general connectivity questions? You can find information about other connectivity methods and answers to general connectivity questions in the General Connectivity FAQs . Service Can I connect to your Elevated OFFICIAL security domain using the unencrypted PSN Assured Service? No. We currently support connectivity to the unencrypted PSN Assured Service via our Assured OFFICIAL cloud platform only. The PSN Assured Service is CAS(T) compliant and so suitable for some OFFICIAL data (previously IL2 data). Customers wanting to use the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform typically have more sensitive requirements related to the confidentiality and integrity of their data, and so are more likely to require the encrypted PSN Protected Service. Only the encrypted PSN Protected Service can connect to legacy IL3 networks such as GSI. Can I connect to the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform using a private encrypted PSN closed user group (CUG)? Yes, you can use HybridConnect to deploy your own PSN circuit and associated CUG. However, the PSN strongly prefers customers to connect to PSN Services (such as the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform) via the PSN Protected Service, which uses the IPED (Inter Provider Encryption Domain) to provide secure, encrypted connectivity independent of the underlying DNSP access connection. PSN CUGs are DNSP specific, and so potentially lock customers in, as these connections usually have minimum contract periods and other commercial barriers. Can I have a combination of government community networks and private accredited networks into the same UKCloud solution? Yes, subject to compliance with information assurance requirements, as only organisations that demonstrate compliance with the appropriate code of connections (for example PSN compliance certificate or approved N3 IGSoC) can have access to government community networks. You should be careful not to misconfigure self‑managed components of the solution (OS, application) to 'bridge' between government community networks (PSN) and private networks. This concern must be addressed by accreditation of the customer-managed components - preferably via PSN Accreditation. Local departmental accreditation by a public-sector customer is also allowed. This applies to solutions on both our Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platforms. The UKCloud Assured OFFICIAL cloud platform features connectivity to the PSN Assured Service (previously IL2). This is provided via resilient, high‑capacity PSN circuits from VMB installed into each of our data centres. The UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform is connected to the encrypted PSN Protected Service (previously IL3) via the IPED. This is provided using circuits from Vodafone into each UKCloud data centre. The PSN Protected Service also provides onward connectivity to legacy government community networks such as PNN and CJX. For both PSN services, we use our data centre interconnectivity (DCI) to provide additional resilience through triangulation. How have you implemented your GSI connections? UKCloud uses Vodafone for connectivity to the encrypted PSN Protected Service into the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform. This connection uses the IPED to provide native connectivity to GSI and other legacy government community networks, including GSE, PNN and CJX. Scalable, resilient PSN Protected Service connections are installed into each of our data centres. We use our DCI to provide additional resilience through triangulation. Do you have an encrypted PSN Protected Service connection? Our Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform is connected to the encrypted PSN Protected Service (previously IL3) via the IPED. This is provided by circuits from Vodafone into each of our data centres. The PSN Protected Service also provides onward connectivity to other government community networks, such as GSI, GSE, PNN and CJX. How long is the lead time for provisioning PSN service into my solution? You request connectivity to the PSN via a Service Request. We typically require two working days to provision the PSN service from receipt of an accepted request. If your solution requires many PSN IP addresses, we may need more time to work with you to get your PSN IP addresses configured to work with your solution hosted on our cloud platform. If you require additional PSN IP addresses , you'll need to request them from the PSN. Do you provide an SLA on PSN connectivity? We provide an SLA for availability of our core services such as UKCloud for VMware. We cannot provide an SLA on external services (such as PSN) as they are outside our control. UKCloud can only provide assurance associated with the native SLAs that are offered as part of the core PSN framework. What is your policy on IP addressing? We've designed our cloud to give you complete control and autonomy over the private ( RFC 1918 ) IP address space you deploy within your virtual data centre (VDC). You can use the self-managed virtual firewall to implement a VPN tunnel, network address translation (NAT) and load balancing to control how you publish the services within your VDC to external networks. For PSN connections to either of our security domains, the PSN has provided us with a limited allocation of PSN IP addresses . The PSN requires customers who need more than a few PSN IP addresses to use their own PSN IP allocation and, if more are needed, to justify an additional allocation directly with the PSN. We will work with you to facilitate the allocation of your PSN IP addresses to your services hosted on our cloud platforms. With the PSN IP addresses, you can establish: Source NAT - all outbound traffic to other resources on the PSN will appear to come from one of these IPv4 addresses. Destination NAT - all inbound traffic from other resources on the PSN must be targeted at one of these IPv4 addresses. You can translate the PSN IPv4 address to an internal (RFC 1918) IP address assigned to a VM or, preferably, to the edge gateway load balancer. A VPN - an IPsec VPN between the IPv4 address of the virtual firewall and the IPv4 address of the firewall at another site. Once the VPN has been established, both sites can directly access the internal (RFC 1918) IP addresses. Before additional IPv4 addresses can be allocated, you'll need to demonstrate your use of: Load balancing services - enabling several web servers to be accessed via a single externally routable IP address Host headers - enabling web servers to accept connections for several URLs via a single externally routable IP address VPN tunnelling - enabling the use of internal (RFC 1918) IP addresses for non‑production services such as UAT and development Is the PSN connection into UKCloud shared by all environments connected to the PSN? PSN is a shared connection and all UKCloud PSN‑enabled customers use a shared bandwidth model. Does each PSN environment have a maximum limit assigned to it? We don't publish limits associated with PSN bandwidth as we capacity‑manage this link to ensure there is always enough bandwidth for our customers. Consumption of PSN bandwidth is based on the actual volume of data transferred (outbound) per month. What is the notice period for PSN termination? The notice period for PSN termination is 30 days. How do I make DNS changes? You'll need to complete the PSN DNS order form, PSN domain name authorisation request form and the PSN customer change form. You can find these forms at: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/psn-dns-change-forms You then need to submit the completed forms to: gcforderdesk@vodafone.com If you don't have an existing contract with Vodafone, a billing account and remedy name will need to be created. How do I order PSN connectivity? When placing an order through your account manager or when raising a service request, you need to provide evidence of your entitlement to connect to the PSN. You will also need to provide updated PSN approval when your certificate expires. How will I be billed for PSN? Billing for PSN is monthly in arrears. Charges are included in your monthly invoice, along with charges for your UKCloud services. Changes depend on whether you're on PSN Assured or PSN Protected and whether you have selected the unmetered data transfer option: If you're on PSN Assured, you'll be charged for outbound data used in the month once you have exceeded 1TB. If you're on PSN Protected, you'll be charged a monthly starter pack fee for the outbound data used which provides 250GB per month. Additional usage will be charged as per the UKCloud pricing guide. For either service, if you have the Unmetered Data Transfer option, you'll be charged a set fee for the month. We charge for each separate connection on the UKCloud platform. UKCloud pricing is available via the G-Cloud Digital Marketplace. How does PSN for Policing work? Cryptographic overlays on top of the PSN network are created that prevent PSN customers from seeing the closed Police network. Please engage with a UKCloud Cloud Architect for more details. What is the suggested Maximum Transition Unit (MTU) for PSN? We suggest an MTU size of 1400 bytes for further information. For more information, see this DDoS mitigation causing VPN failures and slow applications . What PSN Code of Connection (CoCo) do I need to get PSN connectivity on UKCloud? The guidance from PSN Authority is as follows: The PSN CoCo from non-government organisations is called the PSN Service Provision Compliance Certificate. This certificate is the one that is relevant to workloads facing PSN -- there are other PSN CoCos, however are not applicable for non-government organisations. You can present us with one of two CoCos. If you present us with a PSN Service Provision Compliance Certificate then it needs to be applicable to that project or a blanket Service Provision Compliance Certificate, covering many projects that you are doing. The other PSN CoCo, PSN Connection Compliance Certificate , allows the access to connect to PSN to send and receive data from services on it, including creating PSN-connected environments for yourselves on UKCloud. I am a government organisation, what do I need to show you to get PSN connectivity for my UKCloud environment? You must do either of the following: Supply us with a project specific PSN Service Provision Compliance Certificate Supply us with a blanket PSN Service Provision Compliance Certificate that covers all projects you are doing Supply us with a PSN Connection Compliance Certificate, validating that you are connected to PSN I am a non-government organisation but I am supplying a service to a single government organisation. What do I need to show you to get PSN connectivity to my environment? If the government customer is supplying the CoCo, this must be a blanket or project specific PSN Service Provision Compliance Certificate, covering all projects that the government organisation is doing and we must see a statement from the government organisation's SIRO/IA with confirmation to use their CoCo. If the government customer is not supplying them with the CoCo, they will need to apply for a PSN Service Provision Compliance Certificate for themselves. A PSN Connection Compliance Certificate is not an acceptable CoCo. I am a non-government organisation providing a service to multiple government organisations. What do I need to show you to get PSN connectivity to my environment? You will need a PSN Service Provision Compliance Certificate for your organisation. Can I take my assigned PSN IPs with me if I ever migrate away from UKCloud? No, the PSN IPs we have are assigned to UKCloud by the PSN Authority so they are not transferrable. If you apply for your own range of IPs from the PSN Authority, then we can advertise these on your behalf, allowing you to own these IPs and move them if you wish. Can I bring my own PSN IPs to UKCloud? Yes, if you want to bring your own IPs then we can advertise them on your behalf. These are available from the PSN authority. For solutions requiring many PSN IPs we would encourage you to bring your own range. Feedback If you find an issue with this article, click Improve this Doc to suggest a change.

This gives you the flexibility to accommodate diverse workloads within a low latency, accredited platform with native connectivity to non-cloud workloads in Crown Hosting and the networks that are vital to the public sector: from PSN Protected to HSCN and RLI. This Getting Started Guide provides you with the information you need to get up and running with UKCloud for Microsoft Azure. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have access to the UKCloud Azure Stack portal. Introduction to UKCloud for Microsoft Azure At UKCloud, we understand that there is no \"one cloud fits all\" solution. There are usually many factors to consider when looking to move your applications to the cloud, including existing technology investment and skills. Additionally, while some applications can easily move to the public cloud, there are others that for various reasons (latency, connectivity, security, regulation) must run on-premises. Microsoft Azure Stack is an extension of Azure that provides on-premises Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), enabling you to leverage the benefits of cloud in an on-premises environment. UKCloud for Microsoft Azure brings the advantages of the Microsoft Cloud platform to our assured UK-sovereign platform, helping you realise the benefits that a true hybrid cloud environment has to offer, while balancing the right amount of flexibility and control.

    "title": "Enterprise & Private Sector FAQs | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Enterprise & Private Sector FAQs General What do we define as Enterprise & Private Sector customers? Commercial organisations in the Private Sector, especially those in regulated industries that want the choice (no technology or contractual lock-in), assurance (sovereignty and security) and award-winning expertise (customer services) of the UKCloud platform. Which products/services are available to Enterprise & Private Sector organisations? All products and services will be available except for Cross Domain Security Zone, Secure Remote Access, connectivity to public sector networks and access to the Elevated and Tier 2 security domains. Can non-UK companies purchase UKCloud services? Yes. A number of our existing non-UK partners utilise our services for use within the UK for UK-based customers and transactions in line with UK data regulations. Can Enterprise & Private Sector organisations use Crown Campus? No. Crown Hosting is designed specifically and exclusively for use by the UK Public Sector and so Crown Campus will not be relevant to Enterprise & Private Sector organisations. The Private Sector is able to procure space directly from Ark, and so UKCloud will be able to deliver equivalent private cloud and hybrid cloud solutions between Ark data rooms and the UKCloud platform. Can Enterprise & Private Sector customers use the Elevated security domain for sensitive data? No. The Elevated security domain and the Tier 2 security domain are designed to be used only by Public Sector organisations as they are connected to restricted government networks. Enterprise & Private Sector customers can use only the Assured security domain, which is connected to our DDoS-protected internet service, and hence they should design and architect a secure workload to safeguard their data in the same way that Public Sector customers have done. What are your service SLAs? All of our services have formal SLAs supported by service credits. As there is a specific SLA for each service, please review the SLA Definition article in our Knowledge Centre. Will Enterprise & Private Sector customers share the same estate as UK Public Sector? Yes. The UKCloud platform has been designed and has evolved to support all types of workloads with a high level of security, resilience and performance. Data and customer separation of workloads is a fundamental part of our solution and therefore, there are no reasons why the two communities cannot share the same platform. There are some exceptions; Private Sector customers will not be able to access the following services: Elevated and Tier 2 security domains Cross Domain Security Zone Secure Remote Access Government community networks (unless sponsored by a public-sector organisation as part of a solution) Are IPv6 addresses available? We are not currently able to support IPv6, although this is on our technical roadmap. Please contact our technical teams to discuss this further if it a requirement for your solution. Pricing & ordering What pricing is available for Enterprise & Private Sector customers? Enterprise & Private Sector customers receive the same pricing as our public sector customers. Where do I find pricing? All of our UKCloud Service Definitions, Pricing Guide and Terms and Conditions are available from our Knowledge Centre , and are also linked from the Enterprise & Private Sector section of our website . Note that the pricing guide includes some services, security domains and connectivity options that are available only to public sector customers. How do I order? All of our customers, regardless of sector, can order the same way via our sales team who can be contacted by calling 01252 303300 (option 3) or by emailing info@ukcloud.com . There are also contact details on the Service Definitions and on the main website Contact us page. We'll shortly be launching a new credit card-based order system and further details will be made available closer to the launch date. Can I pay with my credit card? While a credit card payment option is not currently available, we are implementing this feature, which will be available soon. Are you able to supply licensing for use by Enterprise & Private Sector customers? Yes. All of our licensing agreements are open to either Public or Private Sector customers, including Microsoft following their removal of G-SPLA where we now supply licenses using corporate SPLA. Do any UKCloud partners cater for Enterprise & Private Sector customers? Yes. We have a large ecosystem of partners, including large system integrators, popular managed service providers and specialist SaaS providers, who already deliver a wide range of services to both Public Sector and Private Sector. Many of these partners share similar characteristics with UKCloud's platform and specialise in high security, excellent service and domain expertise. Contact us by calling 01252 303300 (option 3) or by emailing info@ukcloud.com for further information. Is there a free trial? Yes. We offer a 30-day free trial for many of our services.

    "title": "Invoice and billing FAQs | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Invoice and billing FAQs General When will I be billed? We send out invoices on the first day of each month for the previous month's usage. How can I pay? Payment for UKCloud services can be made by direct bank transfer (BACS/CHAPS). You can find bank details for payment on your invoice. If you signed up with a credit or debit card, your payment card will be automatically charged no sooner than seven (7) days after the invoice date. How is my invoice formatted? Your invoice includes a line for each chargeable service. For example, there might be a row for your UKCloud for VMware charges, one for Cloud Storage and another for HSCN connectivity. What is the evidence file? The UKCloud evidence file is a CSV file provided with your invoice that contains data on your hourly metered charges per month and corroborates how the totals invoiced are derived. Each row in the evidence file represents a chargeable period for a UKCloud service, for example, a VMware VM, OpenStack VM (or instance) or Cross Domain Security Zone Walled Garden. Each row includes usage hours/minutes and relevant charges for that service. How are usage hours rounded? Usage hours are typically rounded up, however there is a maximum of 24 hours total of usage hours per event date per resource ID. Billable hours are calculated as follows: Items with the same VM type, power type, protection type are grouped together. For each group of items with the same VM type and protection type with the power state of on the total number of usage minutes is rounded up to the nearest hour (this is capped to a maximum of 24 hours). Billable hours are allocated to the first matching rated item. The process is then repeated for each group of items with the same VM type and protection type, with the power state of off . What about services that aren't in the evidence file? Some metered services are not yet integrated into the evidence file. You can find details of these services on your invoice. UKCloud for VMware charges How are my UKCloud for VMware VM charges calculated? The cost of your UKCloud for VMware VMs is determined by adding together the cost of your compute, storage, protection and licensing. You can find these individual costs in the following columns of the evidence file in rows of the service type (column H) of VMware VM : Description Column Compute U Tier 1 Storage AE Tier 2 Storage AK Geo-resilient Storage AQ Protection BA Licensing BC The compute cost of a VM (column U) is determined by the amount of time the VM was powered on (column N), the VM size (column O), power level (column P) and security domain (column Q). How many VMs do I have and what t-shirt size are they? Each VM is identified in the spreadsheet by its resource ID (column F). Each VM will have multiple rows depending on when it was created and its different power state during the billing period. The size of the VM is indicated by its Compute Machine Type (column O). Note For user-defined VMs, the highest resource closest to the VM size will dictate the cost. For example 2 vCPU and 16GiB will be charged at the Medium High Memory cost. Do I have any vCloud snapshots that I'm being charged for? If you've taken manual vCloud snapshots of your VM, you'll see these in the following columns of the evidence file: Description Column Tier 1 storage allocated for vCloud snapshots AA Tier 2 storage allocated for vCloud snapshots AG Geo-resilient storage allocated for vCloud snapshots AM How many hours are my VMs on per month? Usage hours are listed in the evidence file in column N (UsageHours). To see how many hours your VMs are on for month, look for the usage hours in rows with a service type (column H) of VMware VM and a power state (column L) of on . How much block storage are my VMs using? The amount and cost of block storage for your VMs is listed in the evidence file under the following columns: Description Column Tier 1 Storage used Z Tier 1 Storage cost AE Tier 2 Storage used AF Tier 2 Storage cost AK Geo-resilient Storage used AL Geo-resilient Storage cost AQ Note 60GiB of Tier 2 storage is included in the pricing for all VMs whilst they are powered on, except for Micro, which has 10giB of included storage. For VMs in powered-off state, consumed storage will be charged at the prevailing rate. What are the protection costs for my VMs? Protection costs for your VM are listed in the following columns of the evidence file: Description Column Protection cost for the VM AT Protection cost for Tier 1 storage AX Protection cost for Tier 2 storage AY Protection cost for Geo-resilient storage AZ Total protection cost BA The cost of protection depends on the protection type (column AR) you have applied to your VM and block storage. The protection type for your VM and its block storage must be the same. How much storage am I using for independent disks, media and templates? UKCloud for VMware costs also include storage used by any independent disks, media and templates you have, which is listed as separate rows in the evidence file. Look for rows with the service type (column H) of VMware Independent Disk, VMware Media and VMware Template. How much am I spending on Windows licensing on my estate? The operating system installed on your VM is shown in column G of the evidence file. Associated licensing costs are shown in column BC. How can I divide up the costs of my estate, for example between different projects, departments or cost centres? You can add metadata to your individual VMs, which propagates to the evidence file (as a semi colon-separated list in column I). You can then add your own formulas to the evidence file spreadsheet to use that metadata to cross charge workloads. For example, if you use metadata to assign VMs to different cost centres or projects, you could add formulas to divide VM charges across those different cost centres or projects. Note The VM metadata will be listed in the evidence file on the day after you tag the VM. For example, if you tag your VM on the 3rd, the metadata will be listed in the evidence file from the 4th, unless a VM power cycle occurs on the 3rd. The How to use VM location in vCloud Director article includes information about how to access metadata for your VMs. UKCloud for OpenStack charges How are my UKCloud for OpenStack charges calculated? The cost of your UKCloud for OpenStack instances is determined by adding together the cost of your compute and storage. You can find these individual costs in the following columns of the evidence file in rows of the service type (column H) of OpenStack Virtual Machine : Description Column Compute U Tier 1 Storage AE Tier 2 Storage AK The compute cost of an instance (column U) is determined by the instance size (column O), security domain (column Q), vCPU (column R), and memory (column S). Are shelved instances included in the evidence file? When you shelve an OpenStack instance, all compute charges for that instance cease, so it no longer appears in the evidence file as an OpenStack Virtual Machine row. When an instance is shelved, a snapshot is taken, so the evidence file includes an OpenStack Image row for the instance, which details the storage charges for that snapshot. How much block storage are my instances using? Block storage for OpenStack instances is included in the evidence as separate line items with the service type (column H) of OpenStack Block Storage Tier 1 or OpenStack Block Storage Tier 2 . The amount and cost of block storage is provided in the following columns: Description Column Tier 1 Storage used Z Tier 1 Storage cost AE Tier 2 Storage used AF Tier 2 Storage cost AK UKCloud for OpenStack storage costs also include any images you have, which are listed as separate rows in the evidence file. Look for rows with the service type (column H) of OpenStack Image . Cloud GPU charges How are my Cloud GPU charges calculated? Costs for Cloud GPU are shown against VMware VMs in the following columns of the evidence file: Description Column GPU type (compute or visualisation) V GPU cost Y The cost of a GPU VM depends on whether it is for compute or visualisation (column X). How can I see how many GPU VMs I have? To find out how many GPU VMs you have, look for rows with a service type (column H) of VMware VM that include a GPU count (column W).

Intended audience This document is for backup administrators who: Are comfortable using an API or command line tools Have signed-up for UKCloud's Multi-Cloud Backup Storage service Have been issued their Multi-Cloud Backup Storage credentials Multi-Cloud Backup Storage Multi-Cloud Backup Storage: Lets you pay for what you use, scaling indefinitely and on demand, removing the complexity of capacity management Natively enables deduplication, reducing the cost and management of on-premises storage solutions Provides easy access to backup storage from any backup application via DD Boost and BoostFS; using Boost protocol vastly simplifies the integration of backup applications and Boost-aware databases with a cloud-based backup target by removing the need to rely on file servers or cloud storage gateways Can replicate backups to give high levels of data durability and availability, eliminating the need for managing a second backup location You can find a full list of DD Boost extensions in our Multi-Cloud Backup Storage FAQs . Use cases The low cost of Multi-Cloud Backup Storage per GB, as well as its backup-optimised performance and almost unlimited scalability, means there's a large variety of use cases for it. For example, it's ideal for data archives, backups, databases and log files because of its: Lower overhead of managing backup infrastructure Lower Recovery Time Objective (RTO) for backup recovery through more granular or application aware backup applications Quicker database recovery, directly from backup target into database Greater control over backups using your own self-service backup applications Before you begin When you request your Multi-Cloud Backup Storage service, UKCloud Support creates the following within your account: Storage unit (a Multi-Cloud Backup Storage enabled storage pool) API endpoint (see below) API username API key (password) These details form the structure of the personalised credentials you'll need to access your Multi-Cloud Backup Storage service. MCBS API endpoint Corsham (Assured) Internet TBC - Q2'19 PSN Assured TBC HSCN TBC Farnborough (Assured) Internet mcbs.frn00013.ukcloud.com PSN Assured TBC HSCN TBC Contact UKCloud Support if you are unsure which endpoint to use. Connecting to Multi-Cloud Backup Storage using Data Domain Boost Filesystem (BoostFS) using Microsoft Windows For authentication we use local accounts, so you need to create a lockbox to store the password and key values for the account. Details on how to create your configuration file, lockbox and mount your storage follow. Create configuration file boostfs.conf contains static configuration that can be used to help connect to your service, key items to configure: [global] # Data Domain Hostname or IP address data-domain-system=mcbs.frn00013.ukcloud.com` (assumes connection to Farnborough Internet API endpoint) # Storage Unit storage-unit={customer storage unit}` (Name of the storage unit as provided in your MCBS credentials) # Lockbox path (default: C:\\BoostFS\\Lockbox\\boostfs.lockbox) # lockbox-path=C:\\lockbox-name [\\\\mcbs.frn00013.ukcloud.com\\{customer storage unit}] # Drive Letter specifies the Windows drive to map to this UNC mount point drive-letter=G: Create lockbox Provide the username and storage unit name for access: C:\\Program Files\\BoostFS> boostfs.exe lockbox set -u {username} -d mcbs.frn00013.ukcloud.com -s {customer storage unit} -l C:\\BoostFS\\LockBox\\boostfs.lockbox Enter your API key (password). Once created you can use this to mount a drive or folder for use with BoostFS. Note We provide your API key, {username}, {customer storage unit} and API endpoint as part of your MCBS credentials. Contact UKCloud Support if you're unsure of any of these details.

    "keywords": "How to access UKCloud services from Walled Garden and Secure Remote Access Overview If you've implemented either Secure Remote Access (SRA) or a Cross Domain Security Zone (CDSZ) Walled Garden solution and want to access UKCloud services (such as WSUS, KMS or Red Hat Update Service), you'll need to edit your edge gateway settings to enable access. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have vCloud Director administrator access to a virtual data centre (VDC) in the Elevated OFFICIAL security domain. Before you begin Before making network changes to your environment, you'll need the following information: The Transit IP for the Elevated edge gateway of your CDSZ or SRA VDC The Transit IP for the edge gateway of your Elevated VDC The IP of the service you require. To get the last two octets of the IP addresses for the service you require, please raise a support ticket on the UKCloud Elevated Portal. Setting up access to UKCloud services The diagrams below show that you need to add two static routes and an SNAT rule on two edge gateways. In vCloud Director, locate the edge gateway that is attached to the Elevated side in your CDSZ or SRA VDC. Create a static route that directs traffic for the service you need via the Transit IP of your Elevated edge gateway. For more detailed instructions, see How to create a static route . Create an SNAT rule on your Elevated VDC to allow the private IP range from your CDSZ or SRA to have external access. For more detailed instructions, see How to create NAT rules . Amend the firewall to allow the private IP range access to the service you require on your Elevated VDC. For more detailed instructions, see How to create firewall rules Add a static route for the return traffic on your Elevated VDC to point to the Transit IP of your CDSZ or SRA VDC. Next steps Now that you've set up access to UKCloud services, you can register your VMs with those services.

    "keywords": "Understanding UKCloud for Microsoft Azure Introduction UKCloud for Microsoft Azure provides you with new options to harness Microsoft Azure alongside other cloud platforms, including Oracle, VMware and OpenStack. This gives you the flexibility to accommodate diverse workloads within a low latency, accredited platform with native connectivity to non-cloud workloads in Crown Hosting and the networks that are vital to the public sector: from PSN to HSCN and RLI. This article provides an introduction to UKCloud for Microsoft Azure and helps you get up and running. Supported features UKCloud for Microsoft Azure supports the following Azure Stack IaaS features: Compute Virtual machines (VMs) provide the basic building block providing compute in Azure Stack. For a list of available VM sizes, see: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-vm-sizes . You can deploy VMs using the UKCloud Azure Stack portal and other tooling. VMs have the following support: API Azure Stack Marketplace - Provides access to pre-created images that help speed up application delivery Azure Resource Manager - Enables you to write templates to deploy, update and delete Azure Stack resources in a single co-ordinated operation https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-vm-considerations Network Virtual networks - Azure Stack enables you to configure virtual private clouds, create and manage your private address space within Azure; you can configure this via the UI, API and other tooling Load balancers (IPv4 only) — You can deploy basic load balancers VPN gateway — You can use the Azure Stack VPN gateway to create site-to-site VPNs to remote infrastructure Routing — You can configure basic custom defined routing on virtual networks; Vnet to Vnet peering is not yet supported https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-network-differences Storage Type of storage Description Notes vs Azure Azure Blob Storage (block) Object storage; good for storing documents, videos, images and so on Size of disk storage differs significantly, as well as naming standards like name length Azure Blob Storage (page) Used to support virtual machine disks; good for randomly accessed large files Azure Blob Storage (append) Used for log files Azure Queue Storage Message queue as a service to provide asynchronous scale out micro-services, among other things Azure Table Storage NoSQL database service; good for highly scalable, eventually consistent database support Max sizes differ Advanced features Key Vault — Azure Stack provides cryptographic secret storage for applications and services. These services can be consumed via both portal and API. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-kv-intro Design considerations When designing your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure applications, consider the following: Compute Azure Stack supports a subset of Azure VM extensions; UKCloud for Microsoft Azure currently supports the following: CustomScriptForLinux v1.5.2.2 & v1.5.2.0 OSPatchingForLinux v2.3.0.1 VMAccessForLinux v1.4.0.0 CustomScriptExtension v1.9.1 & v1.8 BGInfo v2.1 JsonADDomainExtension v1.3 VMAccessAgent v2.0 SqlIaaSAgent v1.2.30.0 DSC v2.76.0.0 & v2.19.0.0 DockerExtension v1.1.1606092330 CustomScript v2.0.6 IaaSAntimalware v1.4.0.0 IaaSDiagnostics v1.10.1.1 MicrosoftMonitoringAgent v1.0.10900.0 For an up-to-date list of the supported extensions, perform the following steps: First, ensure that you've installed the relevant Azure PowerShell modules from the following link: Configure the Azure Stack user's PowerShell environment Then run the following commands: Add-AzureRmEnvironment -Name \"AzureStackAdmin\" -ArmEndpoint \"https://management.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com\" Connect-AzureRmAccount -EnvironmentName \"AzureStackAdmin\" Get-AzureRmVMImagePublisher -Location \"frn00006\" | Get-AzureRmVMExtensionImageType | Get-AzureRmVMExtensionImage | ` Select-Object -Property Type, Version | Format-Table -AutoSize Use load balancers to make the best use of IP address quota Azure Stack API may be a couple of releases behind Azure Single region and single state set (affects availability) VM sets don't support auto-scale, so consider how to handle load Check Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates to see if they're compatible with Azure Stack Storage Azure Stack storage is all served from the same pool of disks and does not provide “limitless” storage, so you should consider the following: Use blob storage (object storage) to support the application; not for multiple petabytes of data storage Put large volume data on UKCloud's Cloud Storage Clean up backups to conserve storage Consider use of temporary storage There is a difference in maximum blob storage between Azure and Azure Stack No guarantees around IOPs Use blob storage for queues to help deliver scalable micro-services Accessing UKCloud for Microsoft Azure You can access UKCloud for Microsoft Azure from the following location: https://portal.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com/ Further information For more information about Azure Stack, see the following Microsoft resources: Get Started with Azure Configure the Azure Stack user's PowerShell environment For more information about UKCloud for Microsoft Azure, see: Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for Microsoft Azure UKCloud for Microsoft Azure FAQs Related videos UKCloud Azure Stack portal overview video Related repositories UKCloud Azure Stack Repository Feedback If you have any comments on this article, or any other aspect of your UKCloud experience, send them to products@ukcloud.com ."

It will guide you through the creation of: An Azure application A service principal name Role assignment Permissions What is a service principal name? An Azure service principal name (SPN) is a security identity used by user-created applications, services, and automation tools to access specific Azure resources. Think of it as a 'user identity' (username and password or certificate) with a specific role, and tightly controlled permissions. It only needs to be able to do specific things, unlike a general user identity. It improves security if you grant it only the minimum permissions level needed to perform its management tasks. To log in and manage your resources via SPN you'll need to create an Azure application and then assign SPN to it. Only then will you be able to perform tasks against your environment.

    "title": "Cloud Storage FAQs | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Cloud Storage FAQs Service What is the service? Cloud Storage from UKCloud is a secure next-generation storage platform designed to address a wide variety of use cases. It's based on Dell EMC Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS), which is an object storage technology natively optimised for cloud storage in terms of scale, resilience and accessibility. Where will my data be physically stored? Data will be stored in one or both of our highly resilient tier 3, UK-sovereign data centres, which are separated by over 100km. How much data can I store? Our Cloud Storage solution can scale to multi-Petabytes across multiple sites, meeting the most demanding storage requirements. How many copies of my data are included? Object storage technology works in a slightly different way to traditional local storage solutions that tend to use RAID as a method to provide data durability. Instead, Cloud Storage provides data resilience using the Reed Solomon 12 + 4 erasure coding scheme, which splits an object into 12 data fragments and 4 coding fragments. These fragments are spread across multiple nodes in the data centre and the storage engine can reconstruct an object from any of the 12 data fragments, providing protection in the event of a disk or node failure. The ENHANCED service level stores an additional copy of your data in our second, geographically remote data centre. Management How do I access the platform? The service is Application Programming Interface (API) accessible, so is an ideal target for customer applications. It can also be used by existing systems. In addition, the platform can be accessed using a variety of software tools such as cloud storage gateways, file browsers and other software products. Documentation on ways to interact with the platform is available from the Knowledge Centre . Is data accessible via the PSN Assured connection also accessible via the internet? Cloud Storage in our Assured OFFICAL domain uses the same environment for both PSN Assured and internet connections. Although it is not possible to bridge between these connections, any objects placed in Cloud Storage via PSN Assured will also be accessible via the internet using the appropriate customer credentials. Can I restrict Cloud Storage access to specific networks? It is possible to lock Cloud Storage accounts down so that buckets are only accessible via a single network (for example HSCN, PSN, Janet), but we cannot lock down a bucket to a customer-specified source IP address or range. Important As we impose this restriction at a Cloud Storage user account level rather than the bucket itself, any new users that you add to the ECS account will be able to access associated buckets from ANY network until you request that we update our blacklist. To request network restrictions, raise a support ticket through My Calls . Alternatively, you can contact support by phone or email. Which APIs are supported by the platform? Our Cloud Storage supports an Elastic Cloud Storage S3-compatible API and the native ATMOS RESTful API. Documentation and user manuals for supported API calls are available from the Knowledge Centre. How frequently can I back up data? The frequency of data backup is defined and managed by your organisation administrator. UKCloud's object storage is however highly durable and can automatically recover from disk and node failure, negating the need for a backup. What reports can I get about storage usage? We provide tools for monitoring used capacity and storage growth via the UKCloud Portal. What software tools are provided? UKCloud does not provide software tools for accessing the platform as storage is accessed via APIs, supporting S3 and Native ATMOS. You can however directly connect any S3 compatible tools to your storage (for example, S3 Browser and Cyberduck). How do I encrypt my data-at-rest? Data at rest encryption is an optional feature of our Cloud Storage product, with no additional cost. There are three options available to Cloud Storage customers looking to encrypt their data: Customer managed encryption. The Customer encrypts their data prior to moving it into UKCloud Cloud Storage. This avoids having to do any additional development against the ECS S3 API and ensures the customer retains the keys used to encrypt the data. Server-side encryption at rest with system generated keys. The customer enables server-side encryption in the request headers when creating buckets using the S3-compatible API, without specifying the keys. In this case the keys are auto-generated by ECS, simplifying key management. However, customers should be aware that the public and private keys used at the top of the hierarchy are shared between all customers encrypting their data through this method. See page 37 of the ECS Architecture whitepaper for more information on this encryption method. Server-side encryption at rest with user-supplied keys. The customer enables server-side encryption in the request header with user-supplied keys when creating buckets using the S3-compatible API. This increases complexity but ensures the customer retains control of their keys when using server-side encryption. There is an example of this method on page 14 of the ECS Security Configuration guide . Ultimately, it is down to the customer to select which encryption methodology should be used and understand the possible risks involved. How do I create new Cloud Storage users? You can create additional users in the UKCloud Portal. For more information, see How to create a new Cloud Storage user in the UKCloud Portal . Support How do I raise a support ticket? UKCloud's secure online Portal provides the most common service management functionality, enabling you to raise support tickets through My Calls . Alternatively, you can contact support by phone or email. How do I manage my services? Cloud Storage on the Assured OFFICIAL domain can be managed over the internet (or other connectivity) via the UKCloud Portal. For the Elevated OFFICIAL domain, security requirements are stricter and require either a PSN-approved connection, UKCloud Secure Remote Access or CAPS-approved encryption. What are your service maintenance windows? As far as possible, planned maintenance of UKCloud's infrastructure takes place between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Sunday, or between the hours of 08:00 and 12:00 (UK local time) on a Saturday or Sunday. We provide customers with at least 14 days' advance notice of planned maintenance. As far as possible, emergency maintenance of UKCloud's infrastructure takes place between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Sunday, or between the hours of 08:00 and 12:00 (UK local time) on Saturday or Sunday, unless there is an identified and demonstrable immediate risk to a customer's environment. Whenever possible, we provide customers with at least six hours advance notice of emergency maintenance. Does the Cloud Storage solution support browser-based form POST upload? Cloud Storage fully supports standard REST API commands (Post, Put, Get, Delete, and Head). Cloud Storage's RESTful APIs support the use of HTML forms to create and update objects. Is Cloud Storage object synchronisation (for example, protection offered at each VM type) synchronous or asynchronous? Protection is asynchronous - a single copy is created, and subsequent copies of the data are created when bandwidth allows. During busy periods, this protection can take longer to complete. Onboarding How can I get started with the service? Within five days of accepting your order, we'll create your primary administrator account and send you a welcome pack, which includes the URL for the UKCloud Portal and associated authentication details. Once you've signed up to the service, you can access your unique credentials (User ID, Subtenant ID, resolvable hostname and shared secret) through the UKCloud Portal, which you simply enter into an EMC Cloud Tiering Appliance or other compatible automated solution. Why can't I see my secret key in the UKCloud Portal? For security reasons, the UKCloud Portal only displays a secret key for a short amount of time after it is set. After this time, the secret key is replaced with the text [FILTERED]. If you forget your secret key, or if it is compromised, you can reset it by clicking the Reset secret button in the Storage section of the Portal. When you reset your secret key, you'll be able to see it in the Portal for up to 24 hours before it is hidden. Billing and legal What is the smallest unit of time I will be billed for? Storage is billed on a per-GiB per-month basis, and is based on utilisation of the storage platform across the month. The minimum amount of time is one month. How is my storage bill calculated? Used storage is calculated on a daily basis. The data for a month is collected, and the average consumption calculated and rounded up to the next whole number to provide the number of GiB consumed in a month. The charge for the total storage is based on a tiering basis as per the Service Definition. When your storage consumption moves into the next tier, only the amount of storage above the previous tier threshold is charged at the lower price. As an example, if a customer uses 520TiB of storage in a month, their charges are calculated as: 250TiB x £0.0200 = £5,000 250TiB x £0.0180 = £4,500 20TiB x £0.0162 = £324 Total cost = £9,824 How can I view billing information? Billing information is provided in an evidence file on the first working day of the month for your previous months spend. How do I pay for the service and what are the termination fees? Billing for the service is one month in arrears and payment can be made by direct bank transfer. There are no termination fees for the service. You are responsible for extracting your own data from the platform if required. UKCloud may make an additional charge for transferring data out of the service. Is there a free trial? Yes, we offer a 30-day free trial so that you can test and evaluate our service without commitment. Your trial provides you with a live environment on the UKCloud platform to test our services and verify whether they are suited to your needs. Security What data is suitable for our cloud? The service is hosted in the UK and operated by security-cleared staff. It has extensive independent validation (including NCSC design reviews) that is fully aligned with the 14 NCSC Cloud Security Principles, and is therefore ideal for all data classified at Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL (including OFFICIAL SENSITIVE). Can systems on different UKCloud platforms communicate with one another? UKCloud's Cross Domain Security Zone allows customers to use the UKCloud-defined and managed UKCloud Guard or a customer-designed and managed Walled Garden to enable communication between platforms. For more information, see the Cross Domain Security Zone Service Definition on the Digital Marketplace. Is there a protective monitoring service? Yes, protective monitoring is included for our IaaS platform and follows GPG 13, more information can be found in our Protective Monitoring FAQs ."

    "keywords": "How to set up Email and Collaboration on an iPhone or iPad Overview Zimbra Collaboration Server Network Edition with Zimbra Mobile enabled integrates natively over the air with the Mail, Contact and Calendar applications on any Apple iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. By using the ActiveSync protocol no additional download is required, only that WiFi or a wireless data plan is enabled. After a simple configuration step you can work virtually anywhere with your Zimbra account on the go. You can use the Apple iPhone to access your Zimbra account three primary ways: Enter Zimbra Mobile settings for email, contact and calendar sync View Zimbra in the Safari mobile web browser Enter IMAP/POP3 email settings For more information about ActiveSync, go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActiveSync . Important Performing the following steps may delete all of the existing contacts on your iPhone. This is a common problem for iPhone users when creating a new ActiveSync account. You should ensure that you have backed up all of your contacts before proceeding. Installation and setup for iPhone On your iPhone Home screen, tap the Settings icon. Scroll down and select Passwords & Accounts . Select Add Account . Choose Exchange . Enter your account information. Email: This is your company email address (for example, user@example.net ) Password: This is your Zimbra password (the same one used for the Zimbra Web Client) Description: This is a description for yourself; use your preferred name for this account Domain: If iOS asks for a domain, leave the field blank Click Next . Enter your server details as supplied by your UKCloud Customer Success Manager. Synchronise Mail , Contacts , and/or Calendars as you prefer by setting the appropriate sliders to on. If you already have contacts, a screen displays asking if you want to keep your current contacts on your iPhone. If you select Keep on My iPhone , you may see duplicate entries of your contacts. Click Save . Your Zimbra Mobile account is now set up and will synchronize to your iPhone. You can now edit your global or account-specific settings as described in the next section. Changing Your Account Settings When you have successfully set up your account, you should begin to see mail folders, contacts, and your calendar(s) appear on your device. When the synchronization completes, you can edit your global or account-specific settings. In Passwords & Accounts you can set global or account-specific usability controls for your email account(s), including setting the number of messages to show, how many lines of an email to preview, font size, how often to sync, and more. Note When you make a global setting, all your email accounts are affected. When you make an account-specific setting, only the selected email account is affected. Calendar Sync Filter Select your Zimbra Account and then select Account Info to adjust whether you want any of the syncing options changed, how many days of email and which folders you want synced. Important If you have a large calendar, you may have some issues if you are syncing more than 200 appointments. Email Sync Filter Select your Zimbra Account and then select Account Info to adjust whether you want any of the syncing options changed, how many days of email and which folders you want synced. Important If you select No Limit and you have a large amount of email, you may have some issues syncing. Accessing ZCS using Zimbra Mobile Web Client All devices with an HTML‑compatible browser can access Zimbra email, contacts, calendar, and briefcase using the Zimbra Mobile Web Client. To use the Zimbra Mobile Web Client, open the HTML-compatible browser on your phone (the Safari icon on your iPhone) and type in the URL of your Zimbra Server with /m/ at the end of the URL. For example, https://domain.servername.com/zimbra/m/ . If you have Zimbra Collaboration 8.x or above, you can use the new Touch Client. You must have a License 1.2 for your server. n your mobile type the URL of your Zimbra Server. For example, `https://domain.servername.com/'. You can see Emails, Contacts and Calendars for now, and it uses an HTML5 interface, so you can see it in your iPad too. Getting Zimbra email using IMAP/POP3 You can read your email on your iPhone just like you would with a desktop email client by setting it up for IMAP or POP3 access. This option is available to both free Open Source users and paying Network Edition users. Note This method only syncs email messages. To access your Zimbra contacts and calendars, use either Zimbra Mobile Web client in the Safari browser or upgrade to Zimbra Network Edition. Under Mail settings, select Add Account . Select Other . Select IMAP , POP3 or Exchange as appropriate. Fill in the Name , Address and Description fields. In the Incoming Mail Server section, provide the Host Name , User Name and Password . Your iPhone automatically detects IMAP over SSL if your server requires it. If your server requires a non-default TCP port specification, use the hostname:port format in the Host Name field. You can adjust SSL settings laster under the Advanced section in the main account settings. In the Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP) section, provide the Host Name , User Name and Password . As with the incoming mail server, the Host Name setting accepts the hostname:port format if the outgoing mail server uses a non-default TCP port. Save the configuration. Note To enable the browsing of child folders of your inbox, but not peer folders such as Sent, Drafts, Trash and Junk, in the Advanced section of your account settings, set the IMAP Path Prefix to INBOX . Accessing Zimbra with Tethered Sync Options It is possible to sync iPhone contacts and calendars using Connector for iSync (Apple) or Connector for Outlook (Windows) or on Linux via iTunes. These options are unsupported by Zimbra and we recommend using Zimbra Mobile instead. SSL Certificates, the iPhone, and Zimbra Mobile The iPhone prefers non self-signed SSL connections. If you have a self-signed certificate, you should install the iPhone Configuration Utility to deploy a self-signed certificate on the iPhone. For more information, see: http://www.apple.com/support/iphone/enterprise/ . An iPhone client must address the Exchange ActiveSync server using the primary name of the server's SSL certificate. This is important when the Zimbra server is being run in a split‑horizon DNS environment, because the name by which you address the EAS server must resolve to the same (public) IP address, no matter where you are. If the Zimbra server does not use the primary server name, if you want to use SSL, you must rebuild the certificate using the primary name. Creating New Mail Notification via SMS You may wnat the Zimbra server to send you a text message when you receive a new email. Click Options . Choose Mail . Select Enable address for new mail notifications . Enter your SMS address in email format. For example number@txt.att.net . Click Save . Now the server will send you a text message when you receive a new email. Text messaging rates may apply. Feedback If you find an issue with this article, click Improve this Doc to suggest a change.

    "title": "Email and Collaboration as a Service FAQs | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Email and Collaboration as a Service FAQs What is the service? Email and Collaboration as a Service provides a range of productivity tools, including email, calendaring and tasks, which help an organisation's end users to work in a secure, efficient and effective way. What makes up Email and Collaboration as a Service? UKCloud manages the underlying infrastructure and application, ensuring the integrity of the email solution and mailbox availability. The customer is responsible for customising and managing the solution in terms of users, devices and client applications. How is Email and Collaboration as a Service billed? The service is charged per mailbox per month (or part thereof) which includes 1GB of mailbox storage. There is a charge of £1 per 1GB of additional storage per mailbox per month. Charges vary depending on the number of mailboxes and whether the service is hosted in the OFFICIAL Assured or Elevated platform. The pricing is stacked and applied for the number of mailboxes within the specified tier. For example, our first 2 tiers are, 1 - 499 and 500 - 999; if you have 600 mailboxes you will pay the first 499 at Tier 1 rate and the next 101 at the Tier 2 rate, the introduction of additional mailboxes up to a total of 999 will be charged at Tier 2 rate, when the number of mailboxes exceeds 999 the additional mailboxes will be charged at Tier 3 rate. Does UKCloud offer a free trial? Yes, we appreciate you might have various concerns about the suitability of our service to run your specific workloads. As we're confident that our service will exceed your expectations, we offer a 30-day free trial so that you can test and evaluate our service without commitment. Your trial provides you with a live environment on the UKCloud platform to test our services and verify whether they are suited to your needs. Before your trial, a Cloud Architect will engage with you to identify the goals you're working towards, to help ensure that your trial meets those goals. Throughout the trial period, a Customer Success Manager (CSM) will provide support for any issues you may encounter or questions you may have. At the end of your free trial, you can seamlessly move to a billed service, leveraging any of the work you've already completed in the live trial environment. Please note, this is for up to 500 users in a single organisation on request. How do I request for a free trial? You can request a trial via the UKCloud website and accept the trial terms and conditions. Your environment will then be set up and you will receive trial credits to the equivalent of £500. What happens when my trial comes to an end? Your Cloud Architect or CSM will contact you when your trial is due to end, either because you have used up all of your credits or because you have reached 30 days (whichever is sooner). At the end of your trial, you can transition to production or cease the trial. Where is the service hosted? The service is delivered from two secure UK data centres by UKCloud. Does my data leave the UK? As the solution is delivered from UK data centres by a UK company, your data doesn't leave the UK when at rest. In addition, the solution provides encrypted client connectivity using FIPS 140‑2 and S/MIME for digital signatures and email encryption. There are also tools to configure administration rights, create audit trails and set access controls for application and data sharing. How is Email and Collaboration supported? UKCloud manages and supports the platform in the UK. Depending on the mail client you choose, it may be supported by the third-party provider and not covered under our SLA.

    "keywords": "Disaster Recovery as a Service FAQs General What is Disaster Recovery as a Service? Disaster Recovery as a Service (powered by Zerto) can help you improve organisational resilience. It enables rapid migration of applications between your local VMware or Hyper-V based VMs and UKCloud for VMware disaster recovery-enabled regions. Can I protect parts of my application? Yes, you can configure your protection groups, which can include multiple VMs. This allows you to protect whole applications or just the parts that are mission critical and you just can't afford to lose. Each protection group has synchronised recovery points to simplify your recovery processes. Can I carry out a test failover? Yes, you can test running applications on the UKCloud platform to ensure failover is working as intended. Please note that these failover tests will not affect your active applications. What is the cost to test failover? When you perform a test recovery, any VMs recovered are charged at the prices associated with recovered VM sizes. See the UKCloud for VMware Service Definition for details on VM prices. It is important to note that you will continue to be charged as long as the failover test is active. Once the failover test is stopped, you will no longer be charged for the VMs. What VMware and Hyper-V versions are supported for recovery on UKCloud? The following table lists the minimum requirements for Disaster Recovery as a Service, based on the currently deployed version of Zerto Virtual Replication (4.5U4) on the UKCloud platform: Product Supported Version Management Plane VMWare vCenter 4.0U1 -- 6.0U2 Microsoft SCVMM 2012 R2 and Server Core: Update Rollup 6-11 (recommended) 2012 R2 and Server Core: RTM Hosts VMWare ESX/ESXi 4.0U1-4.0U3, 4.0U4, 4.1-6.0U1,6.0U2 Microsoft Hyper-V 2012 R2 and Server Core Virtual Machines Hardware Version VMWare Up to Version 10 Hyper-V Generation 1&2 Disaster Recovery as a Service Connectivity Full Duplex Internet connection 5Mb/s minimum IPSEC VPN NA The hypervisor management plane (such as VMware vCenter server) must be installed for Zerto to be compatible with your environment - this means that free hypervisor versions may not be supported. Is the Zerto protection technology available for physical servers? The Zerto technology that underpins the Disaster Recovery as a Service service only supports virtual machines. Physical hardware is not part of the product support. Is the Zerto license included? Yes, all licensing for Zerto used within Disaster Recovery as a Service is included. The price of Disaster Recovery as a Service is based on the storage tier that the VM is being replicated to. For more information please see the Disaster Recovery as a Service Service Definition. What connectivity options do I have? All UKCloud connectivity options are available including Internet, PSN, HSCN, Janet and RLI. Can I replicate into the UKCloud Elevated environment? If you currently have a PSN connection in your primary site, then you would be able to replicate over PSN into the UKCloud Elevated environment. However, if you do not have a PSN connection at your primary site but would like to replicate into the Elevated environment, you can use an encrypted private line to do so. Contact your Cloud Architect for more details on this. How do I invoke a recovery if my Zerto console becomes unavailable? Once the initial configuration has been done using the Zerto Portal on the customer infrastructure, all additional configurations and management can be done using the Zerto Portal within the UKCloud Portal which includes invoking failover and any testing. Is there a way to include appliance storage? Disaster Recovery as a Service addresses server-attached disks, however for appliance storage this is not currently possible. The Zerto technology will be able to replicate if the storage (file or block) is presented to a VM as a virtual disk. How is it billed? The pricing for Disaster Recovery as a Service is simple. You only pay for the data you have allocated to your local VMs. So, for example if your existing VMs use 100GiB of UKCloud protected storage, that's all you'll pay UKCloud to protect based on the Tier of storage and retention period chosen. How do I modify replication in the UKCloud Elevated environment? Zerto replication to the UKCloud Assured environment can be controlled from the internet-facing Zerto Portal, however replication into the UKCloud Elevated environment can only be controlled via the Elevated Zerto Portal. To access the Elevated Zerto Portal, you need to be connected to it via the PSN, RLI, private encrypted connection or our Secure Remote Access (SRA) service. Does UKCloud install the Zerto software in my data centre? No, you are responsible for the installation and configuration of the Zerto software within your data centre. Additionally, you must ensure that the software version of Zerto running locally is the same as that running within UKCloud. UKCloud will make the appropriate Zerto software versions available via the Knowledge Centre. Can I failback to my own data centre or third party data centre? Yes, once you have tested or performed a live failover you can failback onto your own infrastructure using the self-service Zerto portal.

Compared to the OVF file format, the OVA format contains all VM files and *.ovf files compressed into one single OVA archive file instead of many files in a folder. Downloading the OVF Tool You can download the OVF Tool via the following link: https://my.vmware.com/group/vmware/details?downloadGroup=OVFTOOL420&productId=491 You must have a VMware account to download the tool. You can download the OVF Tool for Windows 32-bit and 64-bit, Linux 32-bit and 64-bit, or Mac OS X. After downloading and installing the OVF Tool, you must then go to the directory in which you installed the tool to run it. There is no icon or program logo on your desktop for the OVF Tool, so to launch it, you must use the command prompt. Go to the installation folder and run: ovftool Getting started with the OVF Tool The OVF Tool is a CLI tool, so some level of familiarity with CMD commands helps in using the tool. There are a number of help commands, which are a good source of information: ovftool --help ovftool --help examples ovftool --help locators ovftool --help config You can also find the OVF Tool User Guide at: https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/ovf/ Basic import and export commands You'll mainly use the OVF Tool to import (deploy) and export VMs or appliances into and out of your UKCloud environment. The basic syntax to do this using the OVF Tool is: ovftool <source> <target> Refer to the OVF Tool User Guide for further commands and switches. Importing a .vmx file to a vApp template in vCloud Director To import a .vmx file: In your UKCloud environment, create a catalogue to contain the vApp template. Make sure you are in the correct directory, that is, the directory containing the file you want to import. Run the following command: ovftool --vCloudTemplate --acceptAllEulas --overwrite <filename> \"vcloud://<username>@<apiURL>?org=<computeServiceID>&vappTemplate=<newTemplate>&catalog=<catalogID>\" Where: vCloudTemplate indicates that you're uploading a new vApp template acceptAllEulas indicates that you accept all end user licence agreements overwrite indicates that you're replacing an existing vApp with the new one being uploaded filename is the name of the .vmx file that are importing username is your UKCloud Portal user ID apiURL is your vCloud Director API URL. This URL is different depending on the region in which your environment is located. For more information, see How to access vCloud Director through the vCloud API . computeServiceID is the ID of your UKCloud compute service (sometimes also called an org or vOrg) vappTemplate is the ID of the vApp template catalogID is the ID of the catalog in which the vApp template is located For example: ovftool --vCloudTemplate --acceptAllEulas --overwrite centos71.vmx \"vcloud://auser@api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com:443?org=1-2-3-a4b56c& vappTemplate=centos71&catalog=OVFTool-test\" Tip Make sure you use double quotes ( \" ) rather than single quotes ( ' ). The .vmx file is uploaded as a vApp template into your environment. In the vCloud Director 9. x HTML5 tenant portal, click the clipboard icon to see task status. Importing an .iso file to a vApp template in vCloud Director To upload an ISO image: Make sure you are in the correct directory, that is, the directory containing the ISO file you want to import. Run the following command: ovftool -sourceType=\"ISO\" \"<path>\\<filename>.iso\" \"vcloud://<username>@<apiURL>?vdc=<targetVDC>&org=<computeServiceID> &media=<name>&catalog=<catalogID>\" Where: sourceType (or st ) indicates the type of the source file: ISO path\\filename.iso is the full location of the source .iso file you want to import username is your UKCloud Portal user ID apiURL is your vCloud Director API URL. This URL is different depending on the region in which your environment is located. For more information, see How to access vCloud Director through the vCloud API . targetVDC is the VDC where you want to upload the file computeServiceID is the ID of your UKCloud compute service (sometimes also called an org or vOrg) name is the name to display for the file in vCloud Director catalogID is the ID of the catalog to which you want to upload the file For example: ovftool -st=\"ISO\" \"C:\\example.iso\\\" \"vcloud://auser@api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com:443?vdc=myVDC&org=1-2-3-a4b56c&media=CentOS_ISO&catalog=OVFTool-test\" Tip Make sure you use double quotes ( \" ) rather than single quotes ( ' ). When the ovftool command has finished, the source and target locations are listed and then you're prompted for your username and password. When you are authenticated, the upload process is initiated. The following example shows an upload in progress on the UKCloud target VDC. The next example shows an upload in progress on the UKCloud target catalog under the Media & Other tab. In the vCloud Director 9. x HTML5 tenant portal, you will see this under Libraries . Feedback If you find an issue with this article, click Improve this Doc to suggest a change.

    "keywords": "How to use affinity and anti‑affinity rules Overview Affinity and anti-affinity rules determine whether or not VMs are kept together as they are moved around within your environment. Affinity rules keep VMs together on the same host Anti-affinity rules ensure that VMs are distributed across different hosts For example, if it is important that your application has very low latency, you can create affinity rules to make sure that the application's VMs are always kept on the same host. If you want your application to be robust in the event of host failures, you can create anti-affinity rules to spread the VMs across multiple hosts. Important Excessive use of affinity and anti-affinity rules can cause unpredictable VM and platform performance issues. For example, VMs involved in rules may have an increased likelihood of migrating between hosts simultaneously. Adding a large number of VMs to an affinity rule may cause performance issues if all of the VMs become busy simultaneously. An anti-affinity rule with a large number of VMs may not be honoured if the platform is unable to place the VMs on separate hosts. UKCloud reserves the right to disable or disregard rules if required for maintenance or platform management. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have access to the UKCloud Portal and vCloud Director. Creating an affinity or anti-affinity rule Note You cannot create affinity or anti-affinity rules in the new vCloud Director 9.1 tenant portal. If your environment uses vCloud Director 9.1, you must first switch to the vCloud Director web console. For more information, see How to switch to the vCloud Director web console from the tenant portal . To create an affinity or anti-affinity rule: In vCloud Director, click Administration . Right-click the VDC that you want to work with and select Open. Select the Affinity Rules tab. To create an affinity rule, click the + icon in the Affinity Rules section. To create an anti-affinity rule, click the + icon in the Anti-Affinity Rules section. In the Add Affinity Rule or Add Anti-Affinity Rule dialog box, enter a Rule Name . In the search box, enter the name of a VM that you want to add to the rule. Select the VM and click the Add button. Add more VMs as required. If you don't want the rule to take effect immediately, deselect the Enabled check box. You can edit the rule later to enable it when you're ready. When you're done, click OK . If you selected the Enabled check box, the affinity or anti-affinity rule is applied and the selected VMs are redistributed as required to meet the conditions of the rule.

    "keywords": "How to create a vApp Overview vCloud Director uses vApps to make virtual machine (VM) creation and management easy and flexible. vApps are essentially containers for VMs and can be used in many ways. One of the most common uses of a vApp is to group similar VMs together for easy management. Or you can put VMs that form a multi-tier application into the same vApp for greater control. Up to 128 vApps can be created within a virtual data centre (VDC) and intelligently networked to create complex architectures that can be managed easily. In this guide we'll look at how to create a vApp from scratch. The steps for creating a vApp depend on the version of vCloud Director available in your environment: vCloud Director 8.20 vCloud Director 9.1 Creating a vApp (vCloud Director 8.20) In vCloud Director, on the Home tab, click the Build New vApp button. Enter a name for your vApp. This should be a name that will easily identify it if you're building a large environment with multiple vApps. If you have multiple VDCs on the UKCloud platform, you can decide later which one the new vApp sits in. You can also choose how long the vApp can exist for, which is useful for test & dev projects. When you're happy with these settings, click Next . You can now populate the vApp with VMs. There are several ways to create a VM: From an existing template. The template can be in your own organisation's catalogue or in UKClouds's public catalogue (see How to create a VM from a template ). Catalogue creation is covered in How to create a catalog .

    "keywords": "How to create a vApp network Overview In addition to virtual data centre (VDC) networking, you can create individual vApp networks to have even greater control over your network infrastructure. vApp networks enable you to create smaller networks within individual vApps that have a vApp edge, similar to the edge gateway on your VDC. Although a vApp edge isn't as feature rich as a VDC edge, it enables you to create firewall and NAT rules to separate your VDC networks from your vApp virtual machines (VMs). This means you can create some quite complex networks to satisfy application needs. The example of a vApp network, below, shows the vApp edge. Note You cannot create vApp networks in the new vCloud Director 9.1 tenant portal. If your environment uses vCloud Director 9.1, you must first switch to the vCloud Director web console. For more information, see How to switch to the vCloud Director web console from the tenant portal . Creating a vApp network There are two ways to create a vApp network within vCloud Director: During vApp creation After vApp creation Creating a vApp network during vApp creation Follow the steps for creating a new vApp as shown in How to create a vApp .

On the Network Specification page of the New vApp Network Wizard , fill out the fields as required for your network then click Next . Some options are pre-populated by default; you can change them if you want. On the General page, enter a Network name and Description , then click Next and Finish . Your newly created vApp network is now included in the Network list. Your newly created vApp network is now included in the Network list. If you want to connect multiple VMs within the vApp to the new vApp network, go through and make sure they will all connect to it. When you're done, click Next . On the Configure Networking page, to connect the vApp network to an external VDC network, from the Connection list, select the VDC network that you want to connect to. In the Routing column, select whether to apply NAT and Firewall rules to the vApp edge (you can always change this later), then click Next . On the Ready to Complete page, review your configuration, then click Finish to deploy the vApp. Creating a vApp network after vApp creation If you've created a vApp that is connected to a VDC network, and now you want to convert it to a vApp with an internal network: On the My Cloud tab, double-click the vApp to open it. As you're going to be changing network settings, all VMs within the vApp must be powered off, so, if necessary, on the Virtual Machines tab, right-click each VM and select Power Off . Select the Networking tab. Click the green + icon to add a new network. On the Network Type page of the New vApp Network Wizard , select vApp network then click Next . On the Network Specification page of the New vApp Network Wizard , fill out the fields as required for your network then click Next . Some options are pre-populated by default; you can change them if you want. On the General page, enter a Network name and Description , then click Next and Finish . Your newly created vApp network is now included in the Network list. To connect the vApp network to an external VDC network, from the Connection list, select the VDC network that you want to connect to. In the Routing column, select whether to apply NAT and Firewall rules to the vApp edge (you can always change this later), then click Next . When you're done, click Apply at the bottom of the page. If your vApp is already populated with VMs that are connected to a VDC network, you may want to move them over to the vApp network. To change the network a VM connects to, on the vApp Diagram tab, right-click the VM and select Properties . In the Virtual Machine Properties dialog box, select the Hardware tab. In the NICs section, from the Networks list, select the vApp network to connect the VM to. If you want to dual-home your VM, click the Add button to add a second network. When you're done, click OK . You can go back to the VM properties to see the new IP address assigned to the VM. Viewing and adjusting vApp network settings When you've created your vApp network and assigned VMs to it, you may want to review the vApp network settings and adjust them if needed. On the My Cloud tab, open the vApp you want to work with then select the Networking tab. Right-click the vApp network and select Configure Services . You can now view the default network services and change them if necessary. Enabling DHCP DHCP isn't enabled by default. To enable it, on the DHCP page of the Configure Services dialog box, select the Enable DHCP check box, enter appropriate information then click OK . For more information about DHCP, see How to create a DHCP pool . Creating firewall rules There will be a rule in place to allow any traffic to traverse the firewall. You can amend or delete this rule, or create new rules. On the Firewall page of the Configure Services dialog box, select the rule you want to edit, then click Edit For more about firewall rules, see How to create firewall rules . Creating NAT rules NAT rules, enabled by default, enable mapping between internal VM interfaces and external IP addresses. To edit the mapping rules for a VM: On the NAT page of the Configure Services dialog box, select the rule you want to edit and click Edit . In the Edit IP Translation Rule dialog box, select the VM interface for which you want to edit the NAT rule. From the Mapping Mode list, select the mapping mode. The default mapping is Automatic . You can change this to Manual , in which case, enter an External IP address to which the VM can map. When you're done, click OK . The external IP address will be on the same subnet as the VDC network that connects to the vApp Edge. For more information about NAT rules, see How to create NAT rules . Creating static routes Static routing at the vApp network level allows traffic to route between different vApp networks, across the VDC networks. The prerequisites for static routing are as follows: Static routing must be enabled for the VDC network you're connecting to (see How to create a static route ). The two vApp networks must be routed to the same VDC network. The vApp networks must be in vApps that have been started at least once. To add a static route: On the Static Routing page of the Configure Services dialog box, click Add In the Add Static Route dialog box, enter a Name for the static route. Enter the following details: Network - The address of the first vApp network to which you're adding a static route Next Hop IP - The external IP address of that vApp network's router When you're done, click OK . Repeat for the second vApp network. The tables below provides examples of the settings needed to create a static route between two vApps. Network Information Network name Network specification Router external IP address vApp network 1 192.168.1.0/24 192.168.0.100 vApp network 2 192.168.2.0/24 192.168.0.101 VDC network shared 192.168.0.0/24 N/A Static routing settings Static route to network Route name Network Next hop IP address vApp network 1 To-vapp1 192.168.1.0/24 192.168.0.100 vApp network 2 To-vapp2 192.168.2.0/24 192.168.0.101 Note Make sure your firewall rules allow traffic on the static routes. vApp fencing Fencing a vApp allows identical VMs within different vApps to be powered on without conflict, by isolating the MAC and IP addresses of the VMs. This feature is particularly useful if you are copying vApps or creating catalog images of vApps where these details can't be altered. vApp fencing can be done during or after vApp creation. It is done when the VMs within the vApp sit on the VDC network, rather than on their own vApp network. To apply vApp fencing during vApp creation, select the Fence vApp check box on the Configure Networking page of the New vApp wizard. If you're converting a vApp after creation, on the My Cloud tab, open the vApp you want to fence, then, on the Networking tab, select the Fence vApp checkbox. Make sure you click Apply when you're done to save any changes. Feedback If you find an issue with this article, click Improve this Doc to suggest a change.

    "title": "Multi-Cloud Backup Storage FAQs | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Multi-Cloud Backup Storage FAQs Service What is the service? The UKCloud Multi-Cloud Backup Storage (MCBS) service provides a backup target that is accessible from every cloud within UKCloud’s multi-cloud platform, utilising a technology that is common across backup products, and compatible with certain file systems, enabling open-source backup applications to utilise the backup service as a target. You can also use Multi-Cloud Backup Storage as a remote backup target for your on-premises data. UKCloud's Multi-Cloud Backup Storage is based on Dell EMC's Data Domain Boost™ (DD Boost) software, which provides advanced integration between leading backup and enterprise applications and Data Domain systems. With DD Boost, parts of the deduplication process are distributed to the backup server or application server, enabling client-side deduplication so only unique data segments are sent to the Data Domain system. This enables 50% faster backups and reduces network bandwidth requirements by 80 to 98%. DD Boost provides advanced load balancing and failover, which further improves throughput and resiliency. In addition, Data Domain systems can grant secure access to multiple DD Boost users per system for data protection-as-a-service in private and public cloud deployments. Providing DD Boost users secure access to their data lays the foundation for logical data isolation enabling secure multi-tenancy on a Data Domain system in DD Boost environments. DD Boost offers an extensive range of extensions via Dell EMC's Data Protection Suite for services such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL, Microsoft Exchange and a wide array of backup server applications to help support performance-optimised, off-site, multi-cloud backups. What Data Protection Suite extensions are available? Extension Supported Applications Further Information Dell EMC Microsoft Application Agent Exchange, SQL Server HERE Dell EMC Data Domain® Boost for OpenStorage OpenStorage HERE Dell EMC Data Domain Boost for Partner Integration Dell NetVault Backup, Dell vRanger Pro, EMC Avamar, EMC Database application agent for DD Boost for Enterprise Applications and ProtectPoint, EMC Microsoft application agent for DD Boost for Enterprise Applications, EMC NetWorker, Hewlett-Packard HP Data Protector, Pivotal Greenplum Data Computing Appliance, Quest NetVault, Quest vRanger Pro, Veeam Backup and Replication, VMware vSphere Data Protection Advanced (VDPA) HERE Dell EMC Oracle RMAN Agent Oracle RMAN HERE What is Data Domain Boost Filesystem (BoostFS)? Should an explicit Data Protection Suite extension not be available for your specific application or workload, Data Domain offers Boost Filesystem (BoostFS). This provides a general file-system interface from within Microsoft Windows or Linux to the DD Boost library, allowing standard backup applications to take advantage of DD Boost features. What are the advantages of BoostFS? By leveraging the DD Boost technology, BoostFS: Helps reduce bandwidth Can improve backup-times Offers load-balancing Allows in-flight encryption Supports the Data Domain multi-tenancy feature set As a file server system implementation, the BoostFS workflow is similar to CIFS but also leverages the DD Boost protocol. In addition, BoostFS improves backup times compared to CIFS and various copy-based solutions. BoostFS supports single-node Data Domain systems, high-availability (HA) systems, Extended Retention systems, Data Domain Virtual Edition, and Extended Distance Protection. Which applications support BoostFS? As of BoostFS 1.3: Commvault Simpana versions 10 and 11 Microsoft SQL Server 2012 and 2016 (Windows only) MySQL Community 5.6. and 5.7 MySQL Enterprise Manager 5.6 and 5.7 MongoDB Community 2.6, 3.0, and 3.2 Feedback If you find an issue with this article, click Improve this Doc to suggest a change.
