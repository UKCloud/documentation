<h1 id="private-cloud-for-storage-service-scope">Private Cloud for Storage Service Scope</h1>

<h2 id="about-the-service">About the service</h2>
<p>This document describes the boundaries of the Private Cloud for Storage service, along with the responsibilities of both you and UKCloud to facilitate the installation and ongoing use of the service.</p>
<p>Our Private Cloud for Storage service is a single‑tenant (private cloud) storage infrastructure where your compute needs are hosted either in one of our data centres, to gain the benefits of our Assured and Elevated cloud platforms; or in your Crown Hosting Data Centre (CHDC).</p>
<p>This service offers an increase in both performance consistency and data security over traditional public cloud storage options.</p>
<p>We can provide Private Cloud for Storage on an all-inclusive basis, or you can provide your own hardware, which we'll maintain on your behalf.</p>
<h2 id="capturing-your-requirements">Capturing your requirements</h2>
<p>Your Cloud Architect will capture:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Your end-to-end solution, including your backup and connectivity needs</p>
</li>
<li><p>A forecast of your growth</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your requirements for either an All-Inclusive, UKCloud hosted, or Crown Hosting Data Centre (CHDC) hosted solution</p>
</li>
<li><p>Any deadlines we need to meet</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="designing-your-solution">Designing your solution</h2>
<p>Your Cloud Architect will design your solution based on your needs and will confirm that the design meets your requirements.</p>
<p>When you have accepted the design and provided a purchase order, we'll start to plan the installation, including allocating space in our data centres if applicable.</p>
<p>A project manager will be assigned to manage the install, testing and operational hand over of your service.</p>
<h2 id="design-options">Design options</h2>
<p>Your storage solution can be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In either or both of our two data centres - Farnborough and Corsham, or in a CHDC</p>
</li>
<li><p>Connected to your compute environment in either our Assured OFFICIAL or Elevated OFFICIAL security domain</p>
</li>
<li><p>Part of a Platform as a Service (PaaS) environment</p>
</li>
<li><p>Independent of any other UKCloud product</p>
</li>
<li><p>Connected via the internet, HybridConnect, Janet, MPLS, N3/HSCN, PSN Assured, PSN Protected or Secure Remote Access</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Your project manager will coordinate the build activities, work with your hardware installers and carry out end-to-end testing of your storage solution.</p>
<p>During the installation, we will set up monitoring tools on your storage environment so that we can maintain your service once it has gone live.</p>
<p>Your storage solution will be handed over to you when your project manager can confirm that the testing has proved successful and that you can configure your storage solution to your requirements.</p>
<p>At this time, your storage solution will be considered live.</p>
<h2 id="maintaining-your-environment">Maintaining your environment</h2>
<p>We'll monitor the end-to-end solution for alarms, including your hardware issues and failures.</p>
<p>We'll perform routine maintenance and diagnostics and will liaise with your hardware maintenance provider where necessary.</p>
<p>If necessary, we'll co-ordinate the swapping out of any failed hardware and notify you of any service-affecting maintenance through our change control and notification procedures.</p>
<p>As your storage needs grow, we'll work with you to coordinate the installation of any additional hardware and network requirements.</p>
