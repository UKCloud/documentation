<h1 id="how-to-use-triliovault-self-service-backup-and-restoration-within-openstack">How to use TrilioVault self-service backup and restoration within OpenStack</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>TrilioVault is a tenant-driven Data Protection-as-a-Service (DPaaS) solution for OpenStack clouds. The TrilioVault solution takes point-in-time backup of workloads and supports multiple recovery options to recover your workloads in case of any outages. This article provides detailed instructions from the [TrilioVault Administration Guide] on the system administration tasks relevant to UKCloud for OpenStack. The target audience of the TrilioVault are OpenStack tenants as well as OpenStack Administrators who are proficient with basic backup and recovery concepts.</p>
<p>Benefits of this solution include:</p>
<ul>

<li>In-place restoring a volume or an instance</li>
<li>Search for files in list of snapshots</li>
<li>Results in reducing Total Cost of Operation (TCO) with excellent Return on Investment (ROI).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="understanding-concepts">Understanding Concepts</h2>
<p>Before starting to use TrilioVault, it is necessary to know a few commonly used concepts in TrilioVault. Below are some of the important terms in OpenStack and TrilioVault.</p>
<h3 id="triliovault-dashboard">TrilioVault Dashboard</h3>
<p>TrilioVault dashboard is a plug-in into horizon dashboard and allows a user to create and manage backup jobs. A dashboard is a self-managed portal to schedule and execute on-demand backups of workloads.</p>
<h3 id="instances">Instances</h3>
<p>Instances are the running virtual machines within an OpenStack cloud. In the context of TrilioVault, instances are members of workloads (backup-jobs). TrilioVault takes the backup of those OpenStack Instances which are members of the workloads.</p>
<h3 id="workload">Workload</h3>
<p>A workload is defined as a collection of instances, the interconnectivity between them, the virtual disks mapped to those machines and any metadata associated with each of these resources. The tenant can add or remove instances to/from a workload. An instance can only be a member of a single workload at any given time. If a tenant wants to move an instance from one workload to another, the instance first need to be removed from old workload and then add to the new workload.</p>
<h3 id="workload-policy">Workload Policy</h3>
<p>Workload policy defines various aspects of the backup process including number of backups to retain, frequency at which backups are taken and full backups between incrementals.</p>
<h3 id="snapshot">Snapshot</h3>
<p>A snapshot is the actual copy of the data backup stored in some storage designated as backup store or respository. A snapshot can also be defined as a state of a system at a particular point-in-time. TrilioVault provides its users with the ability to take full and incremental snapshots. A Full type snapshot takes a complete backup of all instances included in the workload independent of previous snapshots. In an Incremental type snapshot, TrilioVault takes backups of only data modified since the last snapshot.</p>
<h3 id="backup-target">Backup target</h3>
<p>Backup target is the storage repository where TrilioVault keeps its backup data.</p>
<h3 id="restore">Restore</h3>
<p>Restore operation recreates a selected snapshot. TrilioVault supports multiple restore options for user to choose from.</p>
<h3 id="one-click-restore">One-click restore</h3>
<p>One-click restore restores the selected snapshot to the exact location including the same network/subnet, volume types, security groups, IP addresses and so on. One-click Restore only works when original instances are deleted.</p>
<h3 id="selective-restore">Selective Restore</h3>
<p>The selective restore method provides a significant amount of flexibility to recover instances. With the selective restore, user can choose different target networks, target volume types, include/exclude specific instances to restore, and target flavor for each instance, etc.</p>
<h3 id="in-place-restore">In-place restore</h3>
<p>One click and selective restores creates brand new resources when restoring virtual resources from the backup media. In some cases it is not desirable to construct new resources. Instead user may want to restore an existing volume to a particular point in time. In-place restore functionality will overwrite existing volume with the data from the backup media.</p>
<h2 id="managing-workloads">Managing Workloads</h2>
<p>TrilioVault can be accessed via you OpenStack Horizon dashboard from within the <em><strong>Backups --&gt; Workloads</strong></em> menu. An example of TrilioVault's user interface is displayed in Figure 2: TrilioVault Dashboard, and is described in Tables 3 and 4.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-workload">Creating a Workload</h3>
<p>A workload can be of two types:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Serial Workload: When the selected workload type is Serial, TrilioVault executes the snapshot process of instances in the workload successively in the order they were added to the workload.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Parallel Workload: When the selected workload type is Parallel, TrilioVault executes the snapshot operation of instances in the workload in arbitrary order.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Workload policy is an admin defined policy template. Cloud administrator defines these policy templates and makes them available for tenants. Each policy defines various aspects of the backup job including snapshot retention, snapshot interval etc. When one or more policies are assigned to a tenant, tenant can only choose one of those policies for their workloads.</p>
<p>To create workload, follow the steps.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Click Project from the left panel. Navigate to Backups then click Create Workload. The Create Workload screen is displayed as shown in Figure 3.</p>

<h3 id="workload-policy-template">Workload Policy Template</h3>
<p>TrilioVault 2.6 has introduced a new concept called workload policy template. The template defines attributes of an SLA. For example, a business critical application may have stringent SLA with hourly backups and 100 snapshots to retain. Cloud administrator can define a policy template that captures this SLA and publish it to tenants. Policy template feature also gives cloud administrator more control over what backup policies that tenants can choose for their applications.</p>
<p>From workflow point of view policy template is very similar to nova flavors where nova flavors are defined by cloud administrator and tenants are only limited to those flavors when creating instances. With workload policy templates, cloud administrator creates various templates and publishes to tenants and tenants are limited to only those policy templates that they are assigned. However, workload policy template is not automatically assigned to each tenant. Cloud administrator should assign each template selectively to a tenant. If a tenant is not assigned any template, that tenant has the freedom to choose/define the backup policy based on Configuring a Scheduling Policy</p>
<h2 id="managing-snapshots">Managing Snapshots</h2>
<h3 id="taking-a-snapshot">Taking a Snapshot</h3>
<p>TrilioVault creates a snapshot of the workload automatically as per the policy settings created as described in Policy Configurations. A snapshot can also be executed manually (on demand). To create a snapshot for a workload, follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Navigate to Backups and click Workload.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Click Create Snapshot corresponding to the workload for which snapshot is to be created as shown in Figure 15.</p>

<h3 id="mount-a-snapshot">Mount a Snapshot</h3>
<p>TrilioVault allows you to view or download a file from the snapshot. Any changes to the files or directories when a snapshot is mounted are temporary and are discarded when the snapshot is unmounted. Mounting is a faster way to restore a single or multiple files. To mount a snapshot follow these steps.</p>
<p>TrilioVault ships with a ubuntu based file manager image. This image includes a web based file manager application that helps with browsing and download files when snapshot is mounted. Before you create a File Manager instance, File Manager (a.k.a Recovery Manager) image needs to be uploaded to the Glance. The cloud administrator can upload the image to Glance and mark the image public so that every tenant will have access to the image. File Manager image includes a qemu guest agent. TrilioVault data mover communicates with the qemu agent to map backup images and discover file systems in the backup images. Since the file manager image includes qemu guest agent, the image should be uploaded to glance with property hw_qemu_guest_agent=yes so Nova will create a qmp channel when creating an instance from this image. TrilioVault horizon plugin uses a special property tvault_recovery_manager, when set to yes it will filter out instances that don’t have this property. If a tenant has a huge number of instances, setting this property on the image will help TrilioVault horizon plug-in present only the instances whose image has this property. In this release we only support launching File Manager instance with virtio bus so please set hw_disk_bus to virtio.</p>
<p>Use the following command to upload the image to Glance and mark it as public image and set the property.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-none">glance image-create --name tvault-file-manager \
--file &lt;File Manager Image Path&gt; \
--container-format bare --disk-format qcow2 \
--progress --is-public=True \
--property hw_qemu_guest_agent=yes \
--property tvault_recovery_manager=yes \
--property hw_disk_bus=virtio
</code></pre>
<p>Once the image is successfully loaded, a tenant can instantiate file manager instance as described below.</p>

<h4 id="in-place-restore-of-a-filedirectory">In-place restore of a file/directory</h4>
<p>The previous section explained how to recover a file or directory from a backup by using the snapshot mount command. However, the web portal based file/directory retrieval is cumbersome and is not very friendly for scripting. With this release, the TrilioVault Recovery Manager image is shipped with cloud-init functionality so you can instantiate the recovery manager instance with a key-pair so you can do a password-less ssh session to recovery manager instance. To do an in-place restore of files or directories, the user first performs a snapshot-mount operation on a backup image and uses the recovery manager instance. Once this operation is completed successfully, the user can mount snapshot VM images using sshfs command as shown in the following figure.</p>
<pre><code>sshfs ubuntu@172.24.4.4:/home/ubuntu/tvault-mounts/mounts mnt
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, 172.24.4.4 is the floating IP address of recovery manager instance. mnt is the mount point. The mnt point can be browsed for VM images/file systems using standard Linux tools and copy required files.</p>
<p><img src="images/fig29b-sshfs-mount.png" alt="sshfs Mount"></p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>sshfs-based mount operation is still subjected to standard Linux user permissions. For example a file that is owned by root and does not have read permissions to ssh user may not be copied</p>
</div>
<h3 id="unmount-a-snapshot">Unmount a Snapshot</h3>
<p>Snapshot can be unmounted when access to individual files/directories are no longer needed. To unmount the snapshot, follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>To unmount a snapshot, login to Horizon dashboard and navigate to Backups. Click <em><strong>WORKLOAD NAME</strong></em>, then click Snapshots tab.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Click Unmount Snapshot as shown in Figure 30.</p>
<p><img src="images/fig30-umount-snapshot.png" alt="Figure 30: Unmount Snapshot"></p>
<p><em>Figure 30: Unmount Snapshot.</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>On confirming the Unmount Snapshot action, TrilioVault will unmount the snapshot. Refer to Figure 31 for details.</p>
<p><img src="images/fig31-unmount-confirm.png" alt="Figure 31: Confirm Unmount"></p>
<p><em>Figure 31: Confirm Unmount.</em></p>

<p><em>Figure 32: Snapshot Unmounted.</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes it becomes daunting to find the snapshot that is mounted, in particular when there are many workloads and many snapshots. When a snapshot is mounted, the file manager instance metadata includes the snapshot ID that is currently mounted with the file manager. Please see the following screen grab from the file manager instance details.</p>
<p><img src="images/fig33-file-manager-metadata.png" alt="Figure 33: File Manager instance metadata with mounted snapshot id"></p>
<p><em>Figure 33: File Manager instance metadata with mounted snapshot id.</em></p>
<h3 id="restore-a-workload-snapshot">Restore a Workload Snapshot</h3>
<p>To return the workload instances to their original state, a snapshot must be restored. When a snapshot is restored, it recreates the original workload instances in the exact same state as they were in, when the snapshot was taken. A single snapshot can be restored any number of times and the existing snapshots continue to be valid even after restoring any snapshots from the list. A snapshot can be restored in three ways.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>One-click Restore</p>
</li>
<li><p>Selective Restore</p>
</li>
<li><p>In-place Restore</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="one-click-restore-1">One-click Restore</h4>
<p>One-click Restore is a single click restore of the snapshot irrespective of the size of the snapshot. The snapshot may include multiple instances, networks or Cinder volumes. One-click is a convenient way of reverting an application to a predetermined point in time. For One-click Restore to succeed, the user needs to make sure that the original workload instances are deleted before triggering the restore operation. This method will restore the selected snapshot to the exact same location same tenant, network, volume types, and so on. To restore a snapshot with One-click, follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Delete all original workload instances from the OpenStack cloud as shown in Figure 34. The Instances display the deleted workload instances.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Login to Horizon dashboard and navigate to Backups. Click <b><i>WORKLOAD NAME</i></b>, and then click Snapshots tab.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Click One-click Restore menu option of the corresponding snapshot as shows in Figure 35.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="selective-restore-1">Selective Restore</h4>
<p>Selective Restore allows for lot of flexibility to recover instances. With the Selective Restore method, end user can choose the target network, target volume types, include/exclude instances to restore, and change target flavor for each VM. instances will get restored as per the end user’s choice. For example, if a tenant would like to restore only selected instances and not all of the workload instances, then the tenant can do that using Selective Restore. Unlike the One-click Restore method, an end user does not need to delete the original workload instances to perform the selective restore operation. To proceed with Selective Restore, follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Login to Horizon and Navigate to Backups.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Click <em><strong>WORKLOAD NAME</strong></em>, then click Snapshots tab.</p>
</li>

<li><p>Each of the subsequent tabs correspond to workload instances created. There is a separate tab for each VM. Using these tabs you can edit restore settings of the respective VM. Select an instance’s tab. You will see options to choose to include/exclude that VM from restore, flavor type, and instance name.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Deselect the checkbox if you do not want to include that particular VM in the restore process as shown in Figure 42.</p>

<p><em>Figure 43: Selective Restore instances.</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="in-place-restore-1">In-place restore</h4>
<p>Both OneClick Restore and Selective Restore create brand new resources as part of the restore process. In some cases, it is not desirable to create new resources. For example, an instance may have an application data residing on a Cinder volume and user only wanted to restore Cinder volume but leave the rest of the VM intact. In-Place Restore allows users to restore selected volume without the need to recreate the whole instance. In-Place restore was introduced in TrilioVault version 2.4.</p>
<p><img src="images/fig44-inplace-restore.png" alt="Figure 44 In-place Restore Menu Item"></p>
<p><em>Figure 44 In-place Restore Menu Item.</em></p>
<p>The current release added a new menu item called In-place Restore which opens a new dialog.</p>

<p><em>Figure 46 Choice of resources to restore.</em></p>
<h3 id="file-search">File Search</h3>
<p>Another important introduced in 2.4 release is the ability to search for a file or list of files within a selected list of snapshots. TrilioVault takes image level backups, yet it provides file level/directory level recovery. However, if a user doesn’t know the latest snapshot where the desired file may reside, it is a painful process to mount numerous snapshots and look for the file. With file search feature, user can quickly find the list of snapshots that the file exists. File Search feature tab is added to workload details page as show below.</p>
<p><img src="images/fig46a-file-search.png" alt="File Search"></p>
<p>Your workload may have more than one VM. First select the VM and then choose the file path. File path may include wildcards which allows listing of files within a directory. For example if you want to search all files with in/var/log/ directory, you can provide a search path /var/log/*.</p>
<p><img src="images/fig46b-file-search-query.png" alt="File Search Query"></p>
<p>By default, it searches all the snapshots available for the workload. TrilioVault file search feature directly searches the backup images. TrilioVault backup images are fully formed and are instantly accessible without the need to restore backup images. TrilioVault leverage this ability to search files and directories on the backup image itself. Though this process appears little slow compared to using some index based solutions, our file search is radically simple and easy to maintain. Also, if you were to transfer a workload from one cloud to another cloud, you can still search backup images in the new cloud. Though it supports multiple snapshots search facility, the search slows down if the number of snapshots in the search increases. Our file search facility provides various filters to narrow down the list of snapshots. From the list of snapshots in the table, user can deselect any snapshots from search. User can also narrow the search by latest number snapshots or by time range. Once user clicks ‘Search’, the results are displayed in a format that looks like <code>ls –la</code>.</p>
