<h2 id="creating-your-network-infrastructure">Creating your network infrastructure</h2>
<p>Before you can begin creating instances, you must first build the required network components. In a freshly provisioned project, the only resource that will exist initially is a shared external network called <code>internet</code>.</p>
<p>You need to create the following minimum set of resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A router using the internet external network</p>
</li>
<li><p>A network and associated subnet, specifying the network address using CIDR notation (for example, 192.168.1.0/24), and DHCP settings for DNS, any static routes, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A router interface to connect the router to your new subnet</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you have created these elements, you can view them in the <em>Network Topology</em> page in the Horizon dashboard.</p>
<p><img src="images/ostack-horizon-network-topology.png" alt="Horizon Network Topology page"></p>
<p>You can create your network infrastructure in one of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Using Horizon to manually create your infrastructure (see <a href="#using-horizon-to-manually-create-your-infrastructure">Using Horizon to manually create your infrastructure</a>)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Using the OpenStack Heat orchestration tool to create stacks (see <a href="#using-the-openstack-heat-orchestration-tool-to-create-stacks">Using the OpenStack Heat orchestration tool to create stacks</a>)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Using the OpenStack API and automation (see <a href="#using-the-openstack-api-and-automation">Using the OpenStack API and automation</a>)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Using the OpenStack CLI clients (see <a href="ostack-ref-cli-clients.html">Command-line clients for UKCloud for OpenStack</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="using-horizon-to-manually-create-your-infrastructure">Using Horizon to manually create your infrastructure</h3>
<p>The <em>Network Topology</em> page is a useful page to get started with. This page provides a resizable, moveable and interactive view of your OpenStack project, along with easily accessible buttons for manually creating routers and networks and for launching instances.</p>
<p>To create your network infrastructure:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In the Horizon dashboard, expand the <strong>Network</strong> menu on the left side of the screen and select <strong>Network Topology</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="images/ostack-horizon-mnu-network-topology.png" alt="Network Topology menu option"></p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <em>Network Topology</em> page, click the <strong>Create Router</strong> button.</p>
<p><img src="images/ostack-horizon-btn-create-router.png" alt="Create Router button"></p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <em>Create Router</em> dialog box, enter a <strong>Router Name</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>From the <strong>Admin State</strong> list, ensure that <strong>UP</strong> is selected so that the router is online at the point of creation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>From the <strong>External Network</strong> list, select the external network to which you want to attach your router.</p>
<p><img src="images/ostack-horizon-create-router.png" alt="Create Router page"></p>
</li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Create Router</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Back on the <em>Network Topology</em> page, click the <strong>Create Network</strong> button.</p>
<p><img src="images/ostack-horizon-btn-create-network.png" alt="Create Network button"></p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <em>Network</em> page of the <em>Create Network</em> wizard, enter a <strong>Network Name</strong> and click <strong>Next</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="images/ostack-horizon-create-network-network.png" alt="Network page of Create Network wizard"></p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <em>Subnet</em> page, enter a <strong>Subnet Name</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Network Address</strong> field, allocate your network a suitable address space.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Gateway IP</strong> field, enter an IP address from the address space for the router you created earlier to use to access the network.</p>
<p><img src="images/ostack-horizon-create-network-subnet.png" alt="Subnet page of Create Network wizard"></p>
</li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <em>Subnet Details</em> page, the only field you'll probably want to change is <strong>DNS Name Servers</strong>.</p>
<p>UKCloud does not provide DNS as a service, so to start with you could make use of Google's public 8.8.8.8 service. You can update this field later if you intend to run your own DNS caching service.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you leave the <strong>Allocation Pools</strong> field blank, then by default the whole address space is used for the pool.</p>
<p><img src="images/ostack-horizon-create-network-subnet-details.png" alt="Subnet Details page of Create Network wizard"></p>
</li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Create</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To add the router interface to link your new network to the router, on the <em>Network Topology</em> page, select the router and click the <strong>Add Interface</strong> button.</p>
<p><img src="images/ostack-horizon-btn-add-interface.png" alt="Add Interface button"></p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <em>Add Interface</em> dialog box, from the <strong>Subnet</strong> list, select your subnet and then click <strong>Add Interface</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="images/ostack-horizon-add-interface.png" alt="Add Interface page"></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="understanding-access-and-security">Understanding access and security</h2>
<h3 id="security-groups">Security groups</h3>
<p>In OpenStack, rather than deploying a perimeter firewall to protect your network from the outside world, every instance is protected by its own firewall. This instance firewall is applied at the network level, independent of any additional firewall the guest operating system may be using. The instance firewall is controlled by applying one or more <em>security groups</em> to the instance, either at instance creation or real-time at any point during the lifecycle of the instance. Where multiple security groups are specified, all the firewall rules in those security groups are applied.</p>
<p><img src="images/ostack-horizon-access-security.png" alt="Access &amp; security settings"></p>
<p>A security group consists of one or more rules. Each rule is composed of
five elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Role</strong> --- Custom or predefined protocol type (for example, TCP, UDP or ICMP)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Direction</strong> --- Ingress or Egress</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Open Port or Port Range</strong> --- Open either a single port or a range of ports</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Remote</strong> --- The source of the traffic to be allowed via this rule (source address for an inbound rule, or destination address for an outbound rule)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The ether type (that is IPv4 or IPv6) --- Not currently available</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/ostack-horizon-add-rule.png" alt="Add Rule page"></p>
<p>When adding a new rule to a security group, you can choose from a pre-populated list of common rules, for example, SSH, DNS, HTTP or SMTP, or you can specify your own custom rule.</p>
<h3 id="ssh-key-pairs">SSH key pairs</h3>
<p>Another change if you're used to using vCloud Director, is the authenticated access to your instances. OpenStack, like most other cloud providers, doesn't use templates that allow password controlled access.
The standard cloud method of authenticating access to a new instance is to use SSH key pair authentication --- your SSH client uses the private key and OpenStack injects the public key into your new instance using
the cloud-init package pre-installed in the instance image.</p>
<p>Before you launch any instances on OpenStack, you need to set up at least one SSH key pair. You can use OpenStack to create a new key pair for you, or if you have an existing SSH key pair, you can import the
public key so that OpenStack can use it to inject into new instances.</p>
<p>To see what public keys have already been set up for your use:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In the Horizon dashboard, expand the <strong>Compute</strong> menu on the left side of the screen and select <strong>Access &amp; Security</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="images/ostack-horizon-mnu-access-security.png" alt="Access &amp; Security menu option"></p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the <em>Key Pairs</em> tab.</p>
<p><img src="images/ostack-horizon-access-security-key-pairs.png" alt="Key Pairs tab of Access &amp; Security page"></p>
</li>
<li><p>If you want OpenStack to create a key pair for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Create Key Pair</strong> button.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <em>Create Key Pair</em> dialog box, enter a <strong>Key Pair Name</strong> and then click <strong>Create Key Pair</strong>.</p>
<p>OpenStack creates the key pair and downloads it in your web browser. Save the file somewhere safe as you will need it when connecting your SSH client to your instances.</p>
<p><img src="images/ostack-horizon-create-key-pair.png" alt="Create Key Pair page"></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>To import an existing public key:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>On the <em>Key Pairs</em> tab of the <em>Access &amp; Security</em> page, click the <strong>Import Key Pair</strong> button.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <em>Import Key Pair</em> dialog box, enter a <strong>Key Pair Name</strong> and paste the contents of your existing public key file into the <strong>Public Key</strong> field.</p>
<p><img src="images/ostack-horizon-import-key-pair.png" alt="Import Key Pair page"></p>
</li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Import Key Pair</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="note-for-windows-users">Note for Windows users</h4>
<p>If you're using a Windows desktop environment, the chances are that you're using the PuTTY program for your SSH client. The PuTTY SSH client doesn't use OpenSSH format files for the key pair files. It does however provide a PuTTYgen program that can import and export in the correct format as outlined below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you want OpenStack to create your key pair:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Open PuTTYgen.</p>
</li>
<li><p>From the <strong>Conversions</strong> menu select <strong>Import key</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="images/ostack-puttygen-import-key.png" alt="Import key option of PuTTY Key Generator"></p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the downloaded private key file generated by OpenStack.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Save private key</strong> button to save the imported key as a <code>ppk</code> file that PuTTY can use for authentication.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>If you want to import an existing key:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Open PuTTYgen.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Generate</strong> button.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Copy the public key from the top of the dialog box.</p>
<p><img src="images/ostack-puttygen-generate-key.png" alt="Generating key with PuTTy Key Generator"></p>
</li>
<li><p>Paste the public key into the <strong>Public Key</strong> field in Horizon's <em>Import Key Pair</em> dialog box.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="launching-your-instances">Launching your instances</h2>
<p>Now that you've considered security, created a network and a subnet, and you've connected them to your external network with a router, you can start to think about launching some instances attached to the network. There are a few choices you need to make when launching your instances. The following sections outline how to achieve this task via the Horizon dashboard, however you can also use the OpenStack CLI, HEAT templates or the OpenStack API.</p>
<h3 id="choosing-your-image">Choosing your image</h3>
<p>When you create an instance in OpenStack, its disk is cloned from an <em>image</em> managed by OpenStack. The image may be a custom image that has been developed for a specific purpose and uploaded to your project. It may also be a custom image that has been specifically shared between two projects. More likely, you'll start by using one of the public images that we provide and manage on our platform.</p>
<p>You can see the images that are available for you to use by expanding the <strong>Compute</strong> menu on the left side of the Horizon dashboard and clicking <strong>Images</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="images/ostack-horizon-images.png" alt="Images page"></p>
<h3 id="choosing-your-instance-size">Choosing your instance size</h3>
<p>If you're already familiar with UKCloud's vCloud Director-based UKCloud for VMWare service, then you may be used to being able to choose exactly how many vCPUs and how much memory a VM is allocated.</p>
<p>In OpenStack, you choices are restricted to a number of pre-defined <em>flavors</em> that define how many vCPUs, how much memory and how much storage an instance may use. Although full details for each flavor are
available through the Horizon UI, there's no overall list available showing all the different flavors and sizes of instances. However, if you've installed the OpenStack CLI tools (see
<a href="http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/common/cli-install-openstack-command-line-clients.html">http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/common/cli-install-openstack-command-line-clients.html</a>),
you can run the following command to retrieve a list of the flavors and their makeup</p>
<pre><code>\&gt; openstack flavor list
</code></pre>
<p><img src="images/ostack-cli-flavor-list.png" alt="List of OpenStack flavors from CLI"></p>
<h3 id="choosing-your-storage-type">Choosing your storage type</h3>
<p>There are two storage options available for use with your instances:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ephemeral storage (default)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Persistent volume storage</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ephemeral-storage">Ephemeral storage</h4>
<p>When you create an instance, the default behaviour is to clone your chosen disk image onto the physical disk attached to the host that will be running the instance. This is not dedicated locally attached storage to your instance, but rather a RAID array of fast SSD disks that is shared by all the instances running on the host hypervisor.</p>
<p>The performance of the ephemeral storage makes for very fast disk access. However, as the disk image is stored locally on the host hypervisor, you're at risk of data loss in the event of hardware failure on the host. For scheduled maintenance on the host, you can live‑migrate instances onto other hosts with minimal interruption. If the host were to suffer a hardware failure, it's likely that you'd lose the data stored on the disk image, so you should architect your application to expect and be able to recover from failure.</p>
<h4 id="persistent-volume-storage">Persistent volume storage</h4>
<p>As an alternative to ephemeral storage you can clone your chosen disk image to an OpenStack <em>volume</em>, which is a persistent storage option backed by a Ceph storage array. The volume is then network mounted onto the host hypervisor and the instance booted from the network attached storage. For scheduled maintenance on the host, these instances are more easily managed onto other hosts. In the event of a hardware failure on the host, the volume can just be mounted to another host and the instance restarted without any data loss.</p>
<p>For more information about volumes, see <a href="#working-with-volumes">Working with volumes</a>.</p>
<h3 id="creating-an-instance">Creating an instance</h3>
<p>You can create a new instance in the Horizon UI.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Click or select <strong>Launch Instance</strong> on one of the following pages:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Images</em> page (under the <strong>Compute</strong> menu)</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Instances</em> page (under the <strong>Compute</strong> menu)</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Network Topology</em> page (under the <strong>Networks</strong> menu)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>On the <em>Details</em> tab of the <em>Launch Instance</em> dialog box, enter an <strong>Instance Name</strong> and select a <strong>Flavor</strong>.</p>
<p>As you select a flavor from the list, the dialog box updates to reflect the <strong>VCPUs</strong>, <strong>Disk</strong> and <strong>RAM</strong> that the selected flavour gives you and the green bars under <strong>Project Limits</strong> update to show what your usage would be after launching the instance. If you select a flavour that would take you over your project's quota, the bar is red rather than green.</p>
<p><img src="images/ostack-horizon-launch-instance-details.png" alt="Details tab of Launch Instance page"></p>
</li>
<li><p>From the <strong>Instance Boot Source</strong> list, select:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Boot from image</strong> to create an instance that boots from the local ephemeral storage.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Boot from image (creates a new volume)</strong> to create an instance that boots from a volume</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>From the <strong>Image Name</strong> list, select your preferred image.</p>
<p>If you're creating an image that boots from a volume, you can choose what size to create the boot disk without being restricted to the disk allocation specified by the selected flavour.</p>
<p><img src="images/ostack-horizon-launch-instance-details-image.png" alt="Select an image"></p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <em>Access &amp; Security</em> tab, from the <strong>Key Pair</strong> list, select the SSH key pair you want to inject into your new instance.</p>
<p>If there is only one SSH key pair configured in your project, it will be automatically selected.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select one or more <strong>Security Groups</strong> to apply to the instance.</p>
<p><img src="images/ostack-horizon-launch-instance-access-security.png" alt="Access &amp; Security tab of Launch Instance page"></p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <em>Networking</em> tab, from the <strong>Available networks</strong> list, select the network that you want to create the new instance on.</p>
<p>If your project has only a single network defined, that network will already be listed under <strong>Selected networks</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="images/ostack-horizon-launch-instance-networking.png" alt="Networking tab of Launch Instance page"></p>
</li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Launch</strong> and OpenStack reports that your new instance is launching.</p>
<p><img src="images/ostack-horizon-launch-instance.png" alt="Launching new instance"></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="accessing-your-instance">Accessing your instance</h3>
<p>Having successfully launched your new instance, you'll want to log in and start installing your applications. To access your new instance from the outside world, you have to associate a <em>floating IP address</em> to the instance.</p>
<p>A floating IP address is a public routable address that is allocated to your project. Having allocated an address to your project, you can then choose to associate it to a particular instance. When you've done this, a DNAT rule is automatically created on the router you created earlier to forward all incoming traffic to your chosen instance.</p>
<p>To associate a floating IP address to your new instance:</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-volume">Creating a volume</h3>
<p>Volumes are block devices that you can attach to instances. Because volumes are replicated across OpenStack's storage array, effectively providing three copies of data from a resilience perspective, they provide the basis of our persistent storage offering.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In the Horizon dashboard, expand the <strong>Compute</strong> menu on the left side of the screen and select <strong>Volumes</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <em>Volumes</em> page, click the <strong>Create Volume</strong> button.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <em>Create Volume</em> dialog box, enter a <strong>Volume Name</strong> and <strong>Description</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>From the <strong>Volume Source</strong> list, select:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No source, empty volume</strong> to create a totally empty volume for customer to populate with their data (this is the default option)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Image</strong> to enable customer to create a prepopulated volume from a previously created image</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>From the Volume Type list, select:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Tier 1</strong> for our most performant block storage for workloads requiring consistently higher disk throughput</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Tier 2</strong> for block storage with typical performance characteristics for use by production applications or storage (this is the default option)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>From the <strong>Size</strong> list, select the size of your volume in GiB.</p>
</li>
<li><p>From the <strong>Availability Zone</strong> list, select the availability zone to which you want to target your volume.</p>

<h3 id="using-the-openstack-heat-orchestration-tool-to-create-stacks">Using the OpenStack Heat orchestration tool to create stacks</h3>
<p>OpenStack provides an orchestration tool out of the box. The Heat tool enables you to describe your infrastructure as a text file, referred to as a <em>Heat template</em>, defining one or more resources using a YAML format. Having defined your resources in your Heat template, you then
use the template to create a <em>stack</em>. The stack contains the instantiation of the resources defined in the YAML file, along with a history of events and operations that have happened to the resources in the stack.</p>
<p>For an example of what a basic Heat template looks like, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/UKCloud/automation_examples/blob/master/heat/example.yaml">https://github.com/UKCloud/automation_examples/blob/master/heat/example.yaml</a></p>
<p>The example.yaml template creates the same router, network, subnet and router interface that you created manually above. In addition, the template defines an SSH key pair, security groups and launch instances. We'll look at these other resource elements in more detail later.</p>
<p>To use a template to create a stack in your project:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In the Horizon dashboard, expand the <strong>Orchestration</strong> menu on the left side of the screen and select <strong>Stacks</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="images/ostack-horizon-mnu-stacks.png" alt="Stacks menu option"></p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <em>Stacks</em> page, click the <strong>Launch Stack</strong> button.</p>
<p><img src="images/ostack-horizon-btn-launch-stack.png" alt="Launch Stack button on Stacks page"></p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <em>Select Template</em> page, from the <strong>Template Source</strong> list, select <strong>URL</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Template URL</strong> field, enter the URL of the Raw version of the template that you want to use (for example, the example.yaml template).</p>
<p><img src="images/ostack-horizon-select-template.png" alt="Select Template page"></p>
</li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <em>Launch Stack</em> page, enter a <strong>Stack Name</strong> and select the <strong>flavour</strong> and <strong>image</strong> as required.</p>
<p><img src="images/ostack-horizon-launch-stack.png" alt="Launch Stack page"></p>
</li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Launch</strong> to start creating the stack resources in the background.</p>
<p>You can go back to the <em>Stacks</em> page to view progress, drill down into the resources defined in the stack and see the events as they happen.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also use an updated Heat template to apply an update to resources in a stack. You can also destroy an entire stack, cleaning up all the resources that you previously created. This makes Heat a very powerful tool for creating short‑lived test and preproduction environments on‑demand that may form part of a continuous delivery pipeline.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-openstack-api-and-automation">Using the OpenStack API and automation</h2>
<p>OpenStack also provides a fully functional API to enable programmatic control over your project. The Horizon UI you used earlier is itself a client that makes calls to this underlying API.</p>
<p>Although you can write your own code to interact with the API, there are a number of different libraries already available covering most popular programming languages.</p>
<p>Alternatively, there is also a growing number of DevOps automation tools available (for example, Terraform and Ansible) that interact with the OpenStack API to orchestrate the creation and ongoing management of your infrastructure.</p>
<p>For an example Terraform configuration to create a similar network infrastructure to the one you created in the previous examples, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/UKCloud/automation_examples/tree/master/terraform-os">https://github.com/UKCloud/automation_examples/tree/master/terraform-os</a>.</p>
<p>Whatever library or automation tools you choose to use, you'll need to know a few important details to make a connection to and authenticate against the API.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In the Horizon dashboard, expand the <strong>Compute</strong> menu on the left side of the screen and select <strong>Access &amp; Security</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="images/ostack-horizon-mnu-access-security.png" alt="Access &amp; Security menu option"></p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <em>Access and Security</em> page, select the <em>API Access</em> tab.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <em>API Access</em> tab, you can see all the relevant API endpoints for making connections to the various OpenStack subsystems, including the <strong>Identify</strong> endpoint, which provides the initial authentication process that you'll typically need when configuring connections.</p>
<p>You can also download your user's OpenStack RC file for use in the following section.</p>
<p><img src="images/ostack-horizon-btn-download-rc-file.png" alt="Download OpenStack RC File button on Access &amp; Security page"></p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>If your account is SSO-enabled, download the v3 RC file and make the modifications stated <a href="ostack-how-use-api-sso.html">here</a>.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="using-the-openstack-command-line-client">Using the OpenStack command-line client</h2>
<p>The OpenStack project provides a command‑line client that enables you to access the project API through easy‑to‑use commands. For example, the compute service provides a NOVA command‑line client.</p>
<p>You can run the commands from the command line, or include the commands in scripts to automate tasks. If you provide OpenStack credentials, such as your user name and password, you can run these commands on any computer.</p>
<p>The following file is a bash shell script format file that sets up all the relevant environment variables in the Linux shell session so that you can use the OpenStack CLI tools. The OpenStack CLI tools, just like the Horizon UI, also communicate with the OpenStack API. This means you
can examine the contents of the RC file to find the settings that you may need to pass into, for example, a Terraform provider definition when configuring it to manage your OpenStack project.</p>
<p><img src="images/ostack-cli-example.png" alt="OpenStack CLI example"></p>
<p>The key values to note here are the <code>OS\_AUTH\_URL</code>, <code>OS\_TENANT\_NAME</code> and <code>OS\_USERNAME</code> environment variables, as these will be common to any API authentication request.</p>
<p>In addition, creating the line export <code>OS\_INTERFACE=public</code> in the RC file should address any issues you may have accessing the Admin API endpoints.</p>
