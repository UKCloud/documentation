<h1 id="private-cloud-for-oracle-software-service-scope">Private Cloud for Oracle Software Service Scope</h1>

<h2 id="about-the-service">About the service</h2>
<p>This document describes the boundaries of the Private Cloud for Oracle Software service (referred to as Private Oracle in this document), along with the responsibilities of both you and UKCloud to facilitate the installation and ongoing use of the service.</p>
<p>This service is aimed at customers who require the perceived benefit of owning their own infrastructure.</p>
<p>Our Private Oracle service is a single tenant (private cloud) compute infrastructure where your compute needs are hosted either in one of our data centres, to gain the benefits of our Assured and Elevated cloud platforms, in your Crown Hosting Data Centre (CHDC), or hosted in your own DC or another DC of your choice.</p>
<p>We can provide Private Oracle on an all-inclusive basis, or alternatively we can supply the environment specification for you to procure your own hardware, which we'll install and maintain on your behalf, or you can arrange alternative management of the private cloud (yourselves, through a partner or through Oracle).</p>
<h2 id="capturing-your-requirements">Capturing your requirements</h2>
<p>Before you finalise your order, your assigned Cloud Architect will finalise capture of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Your end-to-end solution, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Backup and connectivity needs for Private Oracle</p>
</li>
<li><p>Standard UKCloud for Oracle Software needs (if any)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>A forecast of your growth to right-size your infrastructure</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your location requirements for either UKCloud hosted, Crown Hosting Data Centre (CHDC) hosted, or on-premise solution</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your packaging requirements of either All-Inclusive, UKCloud Managed or Customer Managed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="designing-your-solution">Designing your solution</h2>
<p>Your assigned Cloud Architect will design your solution based on your needs and you will be expected to confirm that the design meets your requirements.</p>
<p>This will include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Protective monitoring</p>
</li>
<li><p>Check / ITSHC testing</p>
</li>
<li><p>99.99% service level agreement (SLA)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you have accepted the design and provided a purchase order, we'll start to plan the installation, including connectivity and allocating space in our data centres if applicable.</p>
<h2 id="design-options">Design options</h2>
<p>Your compute solution can be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Based on Oracle Exadata, Private Cloud Appliance (PCA), Private Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) or other Oracle Engineered Systems</p>
</li>
<li><p>Located in either or both of our two sites - Farnborough and Corsham, in a CHDC or in another data centre (including on-premise)</p>
</li>
<li><p>In either our Assured OFFICIAL or Elevated OFFICIAL security domain if hosted within UKC.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Connected via the internet, HybridConnect, CrownConnect, Janet, HSCN, PSN, RLI or Secure Remote Access</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="location-and-packaging-options">Location and packaging options</h2>

<h2 id="upfront-deployment-charges">Upfront deployment charges</h2>
<p>You will be charged an upfront design and deployment fee before hardware is procured and installation is scheduled. See the <a href="https://ukcloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ukcloud-pricing-guide-11.0.pdf"><em>Pricing Guide</em></a>.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Your assigned project manager will coordinate the build activities and ensure end-to-end testing of your service.</p>
<p>During the installation, we'll integrate your cloud into our management platform so that we can maintain your service once it has gone live.</p>
<p>Your service will be handed over to you when your project manager can confirm that the testing has proved successful and that you can provision VMs in your environment.</p>
<p>At this time, your service will be considered live and monthly billing will commence.</p>
<h2 id="maintaining-your-environment">Maintaining your environment</h2>
<p>We'll monitor the end-to-end solution for alarms, including your hardware issues and failures.</p>
<p>We'll perform routine maintenance and diagnostics and will liaise with your hardware maintenance provider where necessary.</p>
<p>If necessary, we'll coordinate the swapping out of any failed hardware and notify you of any service-affecting maintenance through our change control and notification procedures.</p>
<p>As your service needs grow, we'll work with you to coordinate the installation of any additional hardware and network requirements.</p>
