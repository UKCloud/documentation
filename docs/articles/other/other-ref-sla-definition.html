<h1 id="sla-definition">SLA Definition</h1>

<h2 id="availability">Availability</h2>
<p>UKCloud will use reasonable endeavours to ensure that the availability of the UKCloud service purchased by the customer (the service) in a given calendar month equals the applicable Availability Commitment. To define availability, UKCloud monitors a number of service elements — some generic, some service specific — which collectively enable the customer to use or access the service. If the availability of the service is less than the associated Availability Commitment, the customer may request Service Credits for the service within 30 calendar days of the service being deemed unavailable.</p>
<h2 id="unavailability-and-service-level-agreement-events">Unavailability and Service Level Agreement events</h2>
<p>Subject to the Service Level Agreement (SLA) limitations detailed below, the service will be considered unavailable (and an SLA event will be deemed as having taken place) if UKCloud’s monitoring detects that the service or component has failed for five consecutive minutes. The total number of minutes that the service is unavailable is measured from the time that UKCloud confirms the SLA event has occurred until the time that UKCloud resolves the issue and the service becomes available to the customer. If two or more SLA events occur simultaneously, the SLA event with the longest duration will be used to determine the total number of minutes for which the service was unavailable.</p>
<h2 id="service-credits">Service Credits</h2>
<p>If the availability of the service for a particular month falls below the Availability Commitment specified in the applicable SLA (subject to the SLA limitations provided below), customers will be eligible to request Service Credits. Service Credits will be calculated as a percentage of the fees billed for the monthly period during which the SLA event occurred (to be applied at the end of the billing cycle, or of the subsequent cycle if a claim is made after an invoice has been paid).</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>You will not be eligible to receive a Service Credit if your account has any undisputed payments outstanding beyond their due date or you are in violation of UKCloud’s Terms and Conditions including the UKCloud System Interconnect Security Policy (SISP).</p>
</div>
<h2 id="service-level-agreement-limitations">Service Level Agreement limitations</h2>
<p>The following will be excluded from any time-based calculations related to the service being unavailable:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Service dependent — planned maintenance windows (as specified in the applicable service definition)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Emergency maintenance (as specified in the applicable service definition)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your misuse of a particular service (as defined in the UKCloud Terms and Conditions and the UKCloud System Interconnect Security Policy (SISP))</p>
</li>
<li><p>A <em>force majeure</em> event</p>
</li>
<li><p>Denial of service attacks, virus or hacking attacks for which there is no commercially reasonable known solution; or any other events that are not within the direct control of UKCloud or that could not have been avoided with commercially reasonable care</p>
</li>
<li><p>Packet loss, network or connectivity (for example, internet, MPLS) problems beyond UKCloud’s management boundary (for example, border router) supporting our connectivity to the public internet or government secure networks</p>
</li>
<li><p>Any customer-defined or customer-controlled event (for example, unavailability of service resulting from inadequate customer-subscribed services, resources or configuration)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The customer will not be eligible to receive a Service Credit if the service account has any undisputed payments outstanding beyond their due date, or you are in violation of UKCloud’s Terms and Conditions including the UKCloud System Interconnect Security Policy (SISP).</p>
<h2 id="service-level-agreement-claims">Service level agreement claims</h2>
<p>To request a Service Credit, the customer must file a Support Request within thirty (30) calendar days of the relevant suspected SLA event. UKCloud will review the request and issue a Service Credit if applicable.</p>
<p>Service Credits will be issued only to the customer that UKCloud invoices for the applicable instance of the service as a separate credit note that can be applied towards a future invoice for that service only. If the customer’s contract term for the service expires or is terminated prior to a Service Credit being issued, the Service Credit will become void as of the date of the expiration or termination.</p>
<h2 id="ukcloud-sla-monitoring">UKCloud SLA monitoring</h2>
<h3 id="generic-service-components">Generic service components</h3>
<p>UKCloud monitors various elements across the service to ensure that availability can be measured appropriately and realistically. Some elements are generic across all services others are service specific.</p>
