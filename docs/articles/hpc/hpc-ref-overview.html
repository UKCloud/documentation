<h1 id="understanding-high-performance-compute">Understanding High Performance Compute</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The scale and elasticity of cloud makes it an ideal environment for large-scale compute-intensive workloads such as Grid Engines, High Performance/Throughput Compute (HPC/HTC) and Massively Parallel Processing (MPP), all of which have an enduring requirement for large amounts of processor cores and memory.</p>
<p>UKCloud's High Performance Compute service is designed for these types of workloads. In return for a volume and term commitment for a large number of compute cores, customers get a cost-effective, highly scalable infrastructure.</p>
<p>High Performance Compute leverages the benefits of the UKCloud assured cloud platform, providing you with a trusted cloud platform that's connected to key government networks, such as N3/HSCN for health and social care, and Janet for research and education.</p>
<p>For workloads that require a temporary, more flexible or dynamic service, UKCloud's UKCloud for VMware may be more suitable. It offers exceptional performance and scalability, and consumption-based pricing. We also offer UKCloud for OpenStack, so we can deliver a suite of services to meet all of your needs.</p>
<h2 id="key-benefits">Key benefits</h2>
<p>High Performance Compute:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Uses a proven hyperscale architecture to deliver predictable performance at scale</p>
</li>
<li><p>Optimised for the sensitivity of your specific workload via the DDoS-protected internet-facing Assured domain and the trusted Elevated domain</p>
</li>
<li><p>Offers a choice of virtual machine (VM) sizes to suit the core and memory density requirements of your compute-intensive workload</p>
</li>
<li><p>Is tuned to reflect the inherent resilience provided by your Grid Engine solution</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Meaning that you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Deploy compute-intensive workloads on a massively scalable and inexpensive platform</p>
</li>
<li><p>Avoid the CAPEX costs, risk and complexity associated with deploying a private infrastructure</p>
</li>
<li><p>Build hybrid cloud solutions optimised for both compute-intensive workloads or more traditional workloads</p>
</li>
<li><p>Integrate compute-intensive workloads with systems and datasets located on secure government networks (such as N3/HSCN, Janet and PSN)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="high-performance-compute-features">High Performance Compute features</h2>
<p>We understand that long-term compute-intensive workloads require a platform that is suitably scaled, has no resource contention, offers flexible core-to-memory ratios, and is delivered at an appropriate per-core-hour price point.</p>
<p>UKCloud's High Performance Compute is designed to meet these requirements, and to provide an easy-to-deploy and easy-to-use infrastructure that can power your Grid Engine or parallel processing workloads.</p>
<p>The service is provided with a variety of cluster-wide options as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choice of our security domain. We provide both an internet-connected Assured OFFICIAL domain and Elevated OFFICIAL domain, which is primarily connected to government secure networks.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Choice of network connections. This includes PSN Assured, PSN Protected (including legacy networks such as GSI, PNN, CJX), RLI, N3/HSCN and Janet.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Virtual CPU mode option. High Performance Compute is based on hyper-threaded cores which provide a cost-effective solution for compute-intensive workloads. You can opt for Native mode by using up to half the allocated cores to ensure a one-to-one mapping between virtual CPUs and physical (non hyper-threaded) cores for maximum processing power.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Choice of core-to-memory ratio. All VMs in your compute-intensive cluster must be identically configured based on one of two core-to-memory ratios.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>High Performance Compute includes as standard:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Virtual firewall</p>
</li>
<li><p>One production virtual data centre (VDC) and one non-production VDC</p>
</li>
<li><p>VMware High Availability (HA) protection (only with persistent storage)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Basic load balancing</p>
</li>
<li><p>DDoS-protected internet</p>
</li>
<li><p>Personalised support via Customer Success Managers, Technical Account Managers and a telephone support desk</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To model a total cost of ownership, you may also want to consider additional elements, such as connectivity; and service options, such as cloud enablement and cross-domain services.</p>
<p>High Performance Compute is subject to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The minimum cluster size is 1,920 cores; which can be scaled in blocks of 960 cores.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All VMs within the cluster must exist within a single production VDC and within a single site.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All VMs within the cluster must be identically configured and programmatically deployed with appropriate workload distribution such as a grid engine. This is because the SLA does not apply to availability of individual VMs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If using Tier 0 storage is configured with two local disks in a RAID 10 configuration. All available storage in the cluster will be allocated to the customer with a 6-month minimum commitment.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If any VMs are deployed with MS Windows Server OS, all provisioned cores must be licensed and will be charged at the current rate (as shown in the Pricing Guide).</p>
</li>
<li><p>There is a two-year (24-month) fixed-term commitment, which can be continued via a further 24-month call-off contract subject to the standard procedures.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Committed Compute Spend is calculated as the effective hourly cost multiplied by the number of hours in a two-year period (for example 24 x 365 x 2 = 17,520).</p>
</li>
<li><p>50% of the Committed Compute Spend must be paid upfront; the remaining 50% will be invoiced equally over 24 months.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Early Termination Fee: if the contract is terminated before month 24, the customer will be liable for the remaining cost of the Committed Compute Spend</p>
</li>
<li><p>In addition to the Committed Compute Spend, a final balancing payment equivalent to 20% of the Committed Compute Spend will be due at month 24 of the contract. The final balancing payment will not apply in the event that the customer enters into a further two-year (24-month) fixed-term commitment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
