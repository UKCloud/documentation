# UKCloud for Microsoft Azure Onboarding Guide

## Overview

UKCloud for Microsoft Azure provides you with new options to harness Microsoft Azure alongside other cloud platforms, including Oracle, VMware and OpenStack. This gives you the flexibility to accommodate diverse workloads within a low latency, accredited platform with native connectivity to non-cloud workloads in Crown Hosting and the networks that are vital to the public sector: from PSN Protected to HSCN and RLI.

This Onboarding guide provides help for getting your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure environment up and running.

## What is Azure Active Directory and why is it required for UKCloud for Microsoft Azure?

Azure Active Directory is Microsoft's cloud-based Directory and Identity Access Management Service. It provides Single Sign-On and core directory services via a high availability service with automated failover. <abbr title="Azure Active Directory"> AAD</abbr> provides the identity store for UKCloud for Microsoft Azure, supporting features such as two-factor authentication and role based access control.

> [!Note]
> If you do not have an existing Azure Active Directory, please provide a preferred domain name and administrator email address, and UKCloud will create an Azure Active Directory Domain (subject to availability) free of charge.
