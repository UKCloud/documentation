<h1 id="ukcloud-for-microsoft-azure-faqs">UKCloud for Microsoft Azure FAQs</h1>

<h2 id="general">General</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-ukcloud-for-microsoft-azure">What is UKCloud for Microsoft Azure?</h3>
<p>UKCloud for Microsoft Azure is an extension of Microsoft's own Azure Public Cloud platform, delivered as a service by UKCloud from our assured sovereign data centres. Using UKCloud for Microsoft Azure, developers can build applications using a consistent set of processes and tools that best meets their organisational, technical, and regulatory requirements. Developers can speed up new cloud application development by building on application components from the Azure Marketplace, including open-source tools and technologies.</p>
<p>With our Azure solution, we can provide an additional multi-cloud platform option to customers, which reinforces our strategy that one platform does not fit all, while maintaining our UK sovereignty with secure multiple data centres.</p>
<h3 id="why-has-ukcloud-launched-ukcloud-for-microsoft-azure">Why has UKCloud launched UKCloud for Microsoft Azure?</h3>
<p>UKCloud's strategy is to provide a multi-cloud platform and UKCloud for Microsoft Azure is now available for you to consume as either a secure, UK sovereign implementation of Azure Public Cloud, or as a complimentary platform to work alongside other UKCloud platforms. This allows you to have workloads utilising one or more technology clouds such as Azure, VMware, Oracle and OpenStack on the same trusted infrastructure.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-provided-in-this-service">What is provided in this service?</h3>
<p>The first release of UKCloud for Microsoft Azure IaaS provides:</p>
<h4 id="compute">Compute</h4>
<p>Virtual machines (VMs), comprised of CPU, memory and storage, provide the basic compute building blocks in Azure Stack. Initial machine types supported are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>General purpose: Basic A series, Standard A &amp; D Series</p>
</li>
<li><p>Memory enhanced: DS Series</p>
</li>
<li><p>Compute optimised: F Series</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="storage">Storage</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Azure Blob Storage (page): Used to support virtual machine disks. Good for randomly accessed large files.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Azure Blob Storage (block): Object storage. Good for storing documents, videos and images for example.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Azure Blob Storage (append): Good for log files.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Azure Queue Storage: Message queue as a service. Good for asynchronous scale out micro-services.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Azure Table Storage: NoSQL database service. Good for highly scalable, eventually consistent database support</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="network">Network</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Virtual networks - Configure virtual private clouds and create and manage your private address space within Azure. This can be configured via the UI, API and other tooling. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Load balancers (IPv4 only) - Deploy basic load balancers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>VPN gateway - Use the Azure Stack VPN gateway to create site-to-site VPNs to remote infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Routing - Configure basic custom defined routing on virtual networks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-technology-is-ukcloud-for-microsoft-azure-based-on">What technology is UKCloud for Microsoft Azure based on?</h3>
<p>UKCloud for Microsoft Azure is based on a CISCO implementation of Microsoft's Azure Stack.</p>
<h3 id="are-there-any-differences-between-azure-and-ukcloud-for-microsoft-azure">Are there any differences between Azure and UKCloud for Microsoft Azure?</h3>
<p>While UKCloud for Microsoft Azure is developed by Microsoft, some services will take longer to become available. Check the service scope for full details. Initial differences are captured in <a href="azs-ref-overview.html"><em>Understanding UKCloud for Microsoft Azure</em></a>.</p>
<h3 id="does-ukcloud-offer-an-sla-for-this-service">Does UKCloud offer an SLA for this service?</h3>

<p>You're initially allocated three external IP addresses with a new compute service.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-offer-dynamic-or-static-ip-addresses">Do you offer dynamic or static IP addresses?</h3>
<p>Dynamic internet IP addresses are selected from a pre-defined shared pool.</p>
<h3 id="what-firewall-services-are-available">What firewall services are available?</h3>
<p>Firewall services are provided by Azure Security Groups. More information is available <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-vnet-plan-design-arm#security">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-ukcloud-provide-urgent-maintenance-notifications-and-incident-reports">How does UKCloud provide urgent maintenance notifications and incident reports?</h3>
<p>All production services are reported through the UKCloud <a href="https://status.ukcloud.com/">service status page</a> where you can subscribe to RSS feeds and updates.</p>

<h3 id="do-you-offer-load-balancing">Do you offer load balancing?</h3>
<p>Yes. This will be offered as an option. You can also deploy your own load balancer.</p>
<h2 id="storage-1">Storage</h2>
<h3 id="how-much-storage-do-i-get">How much storage do I get?</h3>
<p>You'll get 4TiB, which will be shared between blob, page blob, table and queue storage.</p>
<h3 id="is-storage-persistent">Is storage persistent?</h3>
<p>Storage is persistent unless it is virtual machine temporary storage.</p>
<h2 id="management">Management</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-access-my-ukcloud-for-microsoft-azure-solution">How do I access my UKCloud for Microsoft Azure solution?</h3>
<p>Access to the UKCloud for Microsoft Azure portal is available via the UKCloud Portal. You'll be provided with login details once your account is provisioned.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-access-my-solutions-via-government-networks">How do I access my solutions via government networks?</h3>

<p>This service is designed to be managed using the UKCloud for Microsoft Azure portal. You can also manage it through a command line using the UKCloud for Microsoft Azure API.</p>
<h3 id="what-tools-can-i-use-to-manage-my-service">What tools can I use to manage my service?</h3>

<h3 id="how-quickly-can-i-scale-my-service-up-or-down">How quickly can I scale my service up or down?</h3>
<p>You can scale your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure services either via the UKCloud for Microsoft Azure portal or using the Azure API. This will typically take a few minutes to action. However, if you are likely to increase your requirements significantly, you are advised to plan this with your allocated Technical Account Manager.</p>
<h2 id="support">Support</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-raise-a-support-ticket">How do I raise a support ticket?</h3>

<h3 id="is-there-a-free-trial">Is there a free trial?</h3>
<p>Yes, we offer a 30-day trial for this service.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-request-a-trial">How do I request a trial?</h3>
