<h1 id="private-cloud-for-compute-service-scope">Private Cloud for Compute Service Scope</h1>

<h2 id="about-the-service">About the service</h2>
<p>This document describes the boundaries of the Private Cloud for Compute service, along with the responsibilities of both you and UKCloud to facilitate the installation and ongoing use of the service.</p>
<p>Our Private Cloud for Compute service is a single‑tenant (private cloud) compute infrastructure where your compute needs are hosted either in one of our data centres, to gain the benefits of our Assured and Elevated cloud platforms, or in your Crown Hosting Data Centre (CHDC).</p>
<p>This service is aimed at customers who require the perceived benefit of owning their own infrastructure.</p>
<p>We can provide Private Cloud for Compute on an all-inclusive basis, or alternatively we can supply the environment specification for you to procure your own hardware, which we'll install and maintain on your behalf.</p>
<h2 id="capturing-your-requirements">Capturing your requirements</h2>
<p>Before you finalise your order, your assigned Cloud Architect will finalise capture of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Your end-to-end solution, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Backup and connectivity needs for Private Cloud for Compute</p>
</li>
<li><p>Standard UKCloud for VMware needs</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>A forecast of your growth to right-size your infrastructure</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your requirements for either an All-Inclusive, UKCloud hosted, or Crown Hosting Data Centre (CHDC) hosted solution</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="designing-your-solution">Designing your solution</h2>
<p>Your assigned Cloud Architect will design your solution based on your needs and you will be expected to confirm that the design meets your requirements.</p>
<p>This will include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Protective monitoring</p>
</li>
<li><p>Check / ITSHC testing</p>
</li>
<li><p>99.99% service level agreement (SLA)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you have accepted the design and provided a purchase order, we'll start to plan the installation, including allocating space in our data centres if applicable.</p>
<h2 id="design-options">Design options</h2>
<p>Your compute solution can be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Based on VMware or OpenStack</p>
</li>
<li><p>Located in either or both of our two sites - Farnborough and Corsham, or in a CHDC</p>
</li>
<li><p>In either our Assured OFFICIAL or Elevated OFFICIAL security domain</p>
</li>
<li><p>Connected via the internet, HybridConnect, Janet, N3/HSCN, PSN Assured, PSN Protected, RLI or Secure Remote Access</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="upfront-deployment-charges">Upfront deployment charges</h2>
<p>You will be charged an upfront design and deployment fee before hardware is procured and installation is scheduled. See the pricing section of the Service Definition.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Your assigned project manager will coordinate the build activities and ensure end-to-end testing of your service.</p>
<p>During the installation, we'll integrate your cloud into our assured platform so that we can maintain your service once it has gone live.</p>
<p>Your service will be handed over to you when your project manager can confirm that the testing has proved successful and that you can provision VMs in your environment.</p>
<p>At this time, your service will be considered live and monthly billing will commence.</p>
<h2 id="maintaining-your-environment">Maintaining your environment</h2>
<p>We'll monitor the end-to-end solution for alarms, including your hardware issues and failures.</p>
<p>We'll perform routine maintenance and diagnostics and will liaise with your hardware maintenance provider where necessary.</p>
<p>If necessary, we'll coordinate the swapping out of any failed hardware and notify you of any service-affecting maintenance through our change control and notification procedures.</p>
<p>As your service needs grow, we'll work with you to coordinate the installation of any additional hardware and network requirements.</p>
<h2 id="your-responsibilities">Your responsibilities</h2>

<h4 id="important-chdc-considerations">Important CHDC considerations</h4>
<p>You need to ensure that UKCloud control the physical access to the hardware in your CHDC environment. A service request via the UKCloud Portal must be raised for anyone else requiring access to the hardware, with full details of the activities they wish to carry out. These requests are subject to our approval. This is to ensure that there is no disruption to your service.</p>
<p>We cannot be responsible for any service affecting issues resulting from non-escorted access.</p>
