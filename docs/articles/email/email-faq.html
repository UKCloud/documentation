<h1 id="email-and-collaboration-as-a-service-faqs">Email and Collaboration as a Service FAQs</h1>

<h2 id="what-is-the-service">What is the service?</h2>
<p>Email and Collaboration as a Service provides a range of productivity tools, including email, calendaring and tasks, which help an organisation's end users to work in a secure, efficient and effective way.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Email and Collaboration as a Service has been removed from sale. We'll continue to support and maintain this service for current customers. For new customers looking for a secure email service, please engage with our partner team at <a href="mailto:partners@ukcloud.com">partners@ukcloud.com</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="what-makes-up-email-and-collaboration-as-a-service">What makes up Email and Collaboration as a Service?</h2>
<p>UKCloud manages the underlying infrastructure and application, ensuring the integrity of the email solution and mailbox availability. The customer is responsible for customising and managing the solution in terms of users, devices and client applications.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-email-and-collaboration-as-a-service-billed">How is Email and Collaboration as a Service billed?</h2>
<p>The service is charged per mailbox per month (or part thereof) which includes 1GB of mailbox storage. There is a charge of £1 per 1GB of additional storage per mailbox per month. Charges vary depending on the number of mailboxes and whether the service is hosted in the OFFICIAL Assured or Elevated platform. The pricing is stacked and applied for the number of mailboxes within the specified tier. For example, our first 2 tiers are, 1 - 499 and 500 - 999; if you have 600 mailboxes you will pay the first 499 at Tier 1 rate and the next 101 at the Tier 2 rate, the introduction of additional mailboxes up to a total of 999 will be charged at Tier 2 rate, when the number of mailboxes exceeds 999 the additional mailboxes will be charged at Tier 3 rate.</p>
<h2 id="does-ukcloud-offer-a-free-trial">Does UKCloud offer a free trial?</h2>
<p>No. As Email and Collaboration has been removed from sale, a free trial is no longer available.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-when-my-trial-comes-to-an-end">What happens when my trial comes to an end?</h2>
<p>Your Cloud Architect or CSM will contact you when your trial is due to end, either because you have used up all of your credits or because you have reached 30 days (whichever is sooner).</p>
<p>At the end of your trial, you can transition to production or cease the trial.</p>
<h2 id="where-is-the-service-hosted">Where is the service hosted?</h2>
<p>The service is delivered from two secure UK data centres by UKCloud.</p>
<h2 id="does-my-data-leave-the-uk">Does my data leave the UK?</h2>
<p>As the solution is delivered from UK data centres by a UK company, your data doesn't leave the UK when at rest. In addition, the solution provides encrypted client connectivity using FIPS 140‑2 and S/MIME for digital signatures and email encryption. There are also tools to configure administration rights, create audit trails and set access controls for application and data sharing.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-email-and-collaboration-supported">How is Email and Collaboration supported?</h2>
<p>UKCloud manages and supports the platform in the UK. Depending on the mail client you choose, it may be supported by the third-party provider and not covered under our SLA. Wherever possible, UKCloud will also work with Zimbra to help resolve any compatibility issues.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-use-email-and-collaboration-in-the-ukcloud-elevated-security-domain">Can I use Email and Collaboration in the UKCloud Elevated security domain?</h2>
<p>Yes, Email and Collaboration as a Service is available on both the Assured and Elevated OFFICIAL security domains.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-use-email-and-collaboration-over-closed-networks-such-as-psn-hscn-or-janet">Can I use Email and Collaboration over closed networks such as PSN, HSCN or Janet?</h2>
<p>Yes, you can connect via PSN, Janet and HSCN; via legacy GCF networks including PNN; or by HybridConnect using your own dedicated circuits such as CPS-encrypted tunnels, leased lines or MPLS.</p>
<h2 id="is-the-service-pan-government-accredited">Is the service Pan Government Accredited?</h2>
<p>UKCloud's existing PGA still applies to the infrastructure underpinning our services, but since the move to the Government Security Classification Policy (GSCP), we are no longer able to seek PGA for our services.</p>
<p>We are now required to self-assess our services, with customers then responsible for assessing and selecting the most appropriate cloud services which meet their individual security requirements.</p>
<p>We provide confidence that the service still meets the highest level of information assurance, which is why we continue to conduct independent testing and validation of our platform, and have the findings made available to our customers and partners, enabling their SIROs to make an informed decision about self-asserting any service they choose to consume.</p>
<p>Email and Collaboration as a Service is suitable for all data classified at OFFICIAL, including OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE, under the Government Security Classification Policy (GSCP), and for legacy IL0--IL4 solutions.</p>
<h2 id="which-email-clients-are-compatible-with-email-and-collaboration-as-a-service">Which email clients are compatible with Email and Collaboration as a Service?</h2>

<h2 id="can-i-migrate-my-email-from-another-service-or-data-store">Can I migrate my email from another service or data store?</h2>
<p>Yes. The solution includes a migration wizard to help you migrate from an existing solution to Email and Collaboration as a Service.</p>
<p>We can help facilitate a bulk migration to the platform using local data import.

In addition, there is a centralised mail scanning solution within the PSN; combined with the fact that as a restricted network, spam is much less of an issue than with internet connections.</p>
<h2 id="is-there-a-mail-archive-solution">Is there a mail archive solution?</h2>
<p>Yes, an archive option is available for existing Email customers at an additional cost per GiB per month. Pricing is available via your partner or UKCloud account director.</p>
<h2 id="is-there-a-backup-and-disaster-recovery-solution">Is there a backup and disaster recovery solution?</h2>

<h2 id="what-is-the-briefcase-functionality">What is the briefcase functionality?</h2>
<p>Briefcase is a document storing and sharing function that allows users to upload files to the mail store, so that they can access those files from anywhere via the Email and Collaboration as a Service mail client.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-default-class-of-service-settings">What are the default Class of Service settings?</h2>
<p>A Class of Service exists for each e-mail domain and defines the features, access privileges and default preferences that a new user account receives. For existing accounts, if a setting has been specified within the client’s Preferences tab, it will take precedence; otherwise the Class of Service setting will be applied. All new accounts will inherit the settings from the Class of Service. For information about the default Class of Service settings, or to request that a setting is changed from the default, raise a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-does-it-take-to-get-the-solution-up-and-running">How long does it take to get the solution up and running?</h2>
<p>Within five days of accepting your order, we'll create your primary administrator account and send you a welcome pack, which includes the URL for the UKCloud Portal, mailbox services and associated authentication details.</p>
<p>Your administrator can then set policies, create additional user accounts and allocate roles and privileges for users within their project or organisation. Each user can then log on and begin using the service.</p>
<p>Set up of client-based software or mobile devices may be required, depending on your chosen access methods.</p>
<p>The length of time for the solution to be fully operational depends on the amount of work you require once you've received the welcome pack.</p>
