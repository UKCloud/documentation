# Migration to the Cloud Service Definition

## What is the Migration to the Cloud service?

Smoothly manage your transition from on-premises infrastructure to cloud hosting. This service enables the migration of your on-premises vSphere and Hyper-V workloads into UKCloud for VMware, which enables you to accelerate your cloud migration and move large workloads and data to UKCloud quickly, efficiently and securely.

Continuous replication gives you the ability to carry out multiple tests on UKCloud that simulate how your application will perform on cloud service without affecting live services prior to final failover.

## What the service can help you achieve

- Supports your DC modernisation and transformation projects by reducing the cost and time of migrating existing workloads and data

- Comply with policy, regulation or legislation (for example, Civil Contingencies Act) without the cost, complexity and inefficiency of traditional DR solutions

- Reduce risks to your migration by utilising fully featured testing, using real time copies of production data before you commit the change

- Replicate your on-premises network topology in the cloud using software-defined network capabilities

## Pricing and packaging

Migration to the Cloud pricing can be as low as 2.5p. Full pricing with all options, including licensing and connectivity, is available in the [UKCloud Pricing Guide](https://ukcloud.com/pricing-guide).

## Accreditation and information assurance

The security of our platform is our number one priority. We've always been committed to adhering to exacting standards, frameworks and best practice. Everything we do is subject to regular independent validation by government accreditors, sector auditors and management system assessors. Details are available on the [UKCloud website](https://ukcloud.com/governance/).

## Connectivity options

UKCloud provides one of the best-connected cloud platforms for the UK public sector. We enable access to our secure platform by DDoS-protected internet, PSN, Janet, HSCN, MCN and your own leased lines via our HybridConnect or CrownConnect services. The full range of flexible connectivity options is detailed in the [UKCloud Pricing Guide](https://ukcloud.com/pricing-guide).

## An SLA you can trust

Due to the service being dependent on connectivity between the customer data centre and UKCloud we are unable to offer an SLA relating to the performance of this service.

## The small print

For full terms and conditions, including onboarding and responsibilities, refer to the [*Terms and conditions documents*](../other/other-ref-terms-and-conditions.md).

## Why UKCloud?

UKCloud is dedicated to the digital transformation of our nation's public services through our flexible, secure and cost-effective multi-cloud platform and the expertise of our people and partners. We believe that diversity of technology drives value and innovation and so we bring together different cloud technologies, with different deployment models spanning on-premises (private cloud), on-campus (Government's Crown Campus) and off-campus global public cloud services. This enables you to choose the right cloud for creating new workloads or migrating or replacing existing applications to the cloud with specialist SaaS solutions.
