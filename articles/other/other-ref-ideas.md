# UKCloud Ideas

## What is UKCloud Ideas?

UKCloud Ideas is for your use, so you can help shape what we do: <http://ideas.ukcloud.com>.

UKCloud Ideas gives you the opportunity to share your innovative ideas and suggestions to us, as well as see highlights as to what is upcoming on our development roadmap. You can also vote and comment on an existing idea, which allows us to understand the importance of the idea and provide further information or direction. Ideas with the most votes will be given a higher priority on the roadmap. There is no need to log in or register to view the Ideas site.

## How do I sign up to UKCloud Ideas?

All UKCloud portal users can sign up to UKCloud Ideas. You can sign up at: <http://ideas.ukcloud.com>.

Once signed up, you can log in using your email address and password.

## How does UKCloud Ideas work?

Once signed in, you can post an idea that you believe would add value to UKCloud customers. Every idea submitted is passed to the Customer Voice Team who are responsible for ensuring that the idea is directed to the right team within UKCloud. Each idea received is assessed, and added to the delivery road map if it is in-line with our overall strategy. Each idea is judged on its own merits. Not all ideas can be worked on straight away, so some will be added as future developments.

You can vote and comment on other community member ideas. These ideas can be voted up or down so we can tell how much interest there is in an idea.

UKCloud Ideas is a beta service being developed using an Agile approach. It's important to us that we start collating and gathering your ideas as soon as possible so we decided not to include customer portal logon integration as part of the “minimum viable product”. We're sorry if this is inconvenient and will look to introducing this functionality in a future iteration of the service.

## How can I see what is happening with my idea?

Each idea will be assigned a status as follows:

- **New:** the idea has been created and we’re waiting to see what the community thinks of it
- **Under consideration:** we’re assessing the idea to see if it’s viable.
- **On roadmap:** the idea has been approved and has been added to our roadmap
- **Considered for future:** it’s not something we’re going to do short term although it may be incorporated into the future roadmap, or we haven’t fully assessed the idea
- **Not planned:** this isn’t an idea we’re going to progress
- **Delivered:** we’ve implemented the idea

You have the option to receive an email when someone comments on your idea, which can be set when the idea is created.

All ideas are updated regularly on their progress by the UKCloud Products Team.
