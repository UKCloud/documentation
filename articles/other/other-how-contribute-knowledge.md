    > [!NOTE]
    > You must create the Pull Request to submit your changes.

12. The Pull Request is submitted to UKCloud to review and merge into the master branch if appropriate. We may contact you to discuss the details of your changes if required.

## Submitting larger changes across multiple articles or creating new articles

If you're familiar with working in GitHub and want to submit changes to multiple articles, or even create a new article, you may find it easier to [fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and work on your changes there before creating your Pull Request.

For a template to get you started with a new article, see [*UKCloud Knowledge Centre article template*](other-ref-knowledge-template.md).
