## Changes

### What changes have been made to the Cloud GPU option?

The Cloud GPU option is now supported on the UKCloud for VMware, UKCloud for OpenStack and High Performance Compute services.

### What changes have been made to the Multi-Cloud Backup Storage service?

We've now added support for Data Protection Suite (DPS). DPS is a de-duplication agent that enables customers to reduce the amount of storage consumed on the platform by buying the software agent upfront.

### What are the key changes to the Multi-Cloud for Tier 2 (UKCloud X) suite of products?

We've simplified the pricing model to offer hourly and monthly pricing for every community of interest (COI) multi-cloud service. Customers opting for hourly pricing have a minimum commitment term of three months. Customers using monthly pricing have a minimum commitment term of six months. We've also changed the concept from “base pack” to “floor pricing”, giving customers greater flexibility over their VM and storage choices and removing the restrictions of a pre-defined pack of resources.

### What changes have been made to the UKCloud for Oracle Software service?

This service now includes options for SPARC-based hardware. This is ideal for customers transitioning Oracle databases and looking to continue to run large scale enterprise workloads which may already run on SPARC based hardware.

Pricing has also been simplified, by clarifying that customers can purchase on a per core, per GiB of RAM basis as required.

### How have the connectivity options changed?

UKCloud has now included the capability to offer connectivity to the Scottish Wide Area Network (SWAN) on a single-tenant basis.

The HybridConnect pricing has now changed from being a single setup fee to a lower setup fee and a low recurring monthly charge. For more information, please refer to the [Pricing Guide](https://ukcloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ukcloud-pricing-guide-11.0.pdf).

We've also made a couple of name changes to connectivity products:

- Global Load Balancing is now UltraDNS

- Application Tuned DDoS Protection is now SiteProtect Advanced DDoS Mitigation

### What are the key changes to the UKCloud for OpenStack service?

We've added a new instance size to the portfolio: p1.medium. This instance comes with 12 vCPU, 128 GiB RAM and 60 GiB of ephemeral storage. Please view the [Pricing Guide](https://ukcloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ukcloud-pricing-guide-11.0.pdf) for further information.

Based on customer demand, we've now added a new backup and restoration tool from TrilioVault. For early access, speak to your Technical Account Manager.

### What’s new in Cloud Storage?

With this service we've added storage gateway options for customers, making it easier to target our object storage platform. For more information on the gateway options see the [Cloud Storage Service Definition](../cloud-storage/cs-sd.md).

### What are the key changes to the UKCloud for VMware service?

We now offer customers access to advanced networking features such as Distributed Firewall, Distributed Logical Router and L2 VPN along with monitoring features that provides much greater granularity and reporting in a customer’s environment. Both these options are available at a 15% cost increase in addition to the VM cost. See the [Pricing Guide](https://ukcloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ukcloud-pricing-guide-11.0.pdf) for more details.

### What are the key changes to the Basic Managed VM service?

This service has now had a minor name change and is now known as Basic Managed Compute.

We can now offer customers management of their workloads running in Microsoft Public Azure environments. Please note, customers must purchase another UKCloud service to take advantage of this service.

## End of sale

### What is happening to End User Compute?

This has been removed from sale. However, we'll continue to support and maintain this service for current customers. For new customers looking for a secure email service, please engage with our partner team at <partners@ukcloud.com>.
