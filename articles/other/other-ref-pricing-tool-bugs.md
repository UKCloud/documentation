# Known bugs in the Pricing Estimator Tool

This is an accompanying article to the [Pricing Estimator Tool guide](other-how-use-pricing-tool.md). This article intends to be a constantly updated list of issues and bugs users experience will the tool. As we update the tool, this article will be updated accordingly.

## Current version

The current version of the tool:

- **Windows version**: 10.2.8

- **Mac version**: 10.2.8

## Known issues

### Windows

1. Within the UKCloud for VMware section, a user can add additional storage GiB without selecting the Storage type â€“ with no error message.

This storage is added to the estimate BUT the calculation does not work. It displays the additional storage as being free, which is incorrect.

Workaround: if the user selects the storage type first and not enter any GiB then an error message appears which is correct.

### Mac

The following are known issues with the Mac version of the Pricing Estimation Tool.

1. You cannot select a date in the date picker. Instead you must enter the date manually.

2. When creating an estimate for **Cloud GPU for HPC**, if you click the increase counter for **Cloud GPU Cards** the number is added twice. You'll need to manually edit the field to remove the duplicated number.

3. If you select **Save as** from the main menu, you'll see the following error message:

    If you click **Abort**, the tool closes and your estimate will not be saved. Instead, click **OK** to save the estimate successfully.

4. If you minimise the tool's window, there is no way to resize it. You must close the tool and reopen it.
