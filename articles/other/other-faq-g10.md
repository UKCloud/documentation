# G-Cloud 10 services FAQs

## Summary

### What's happening in G-Cloud 10?

UKCloud continues to innovate and enhance services by refining them to better meet the unique needs of UK public sector organisations. G-Cloud 10 paves the way for new products along with improvements and additional options for existing services.

Key changes to our service portfolio include:

- NEW IaaS service: UKCloud for Microsoft Azure

- NEW IaaS service: End User Compute

- NEW IaaS service: Private Cloud for Oracle Software

- Retired service: Hadoop in the Cloud, as we're now helping customers build big data solutions instead on large OpenStack instances

- Retired service: Cloud Foundry support within UKCloud for OpenShift, as the PaaS market has swayed heavily towards Docker and Kubernetes.

We have also made changes and enhancements to almost all of our existing services.

### When will the changes take effect?

All existing customer solutions will automatically benefit from the service improvements and new service options from 2 July 2018. Updated Service Definitions for amended and new services are available via the Digital Marketplace and the UKCloud Portal. We recommend that you familiarise yourselves with the new documentation.

### Can I retain my G9 service?

Yes, you will still receive the same service, with the improvements and enhancements we have made for G10.

### If I have a query about my August 2018 invoice, who should I contact?

Please contact the finance department by emailing <invoicing@ukcloud.com>.

## New services

### What is UKCloud for Microsoft Azure?

UKCloud for Microsoft Azure harnesses the innovation of Microsoft's Azure platform and deliver this service from within our award-winning government-grade multi-cloud environment - addressing the service,  connectivity and diversity requirements of UK public sector organisations and their industry partners.

Our UKCloud for Microsoft Azure cloud provides you with new options to harness Microsoft Azure alongside our OpenStack, Oracle and VMware clouds.Â This provides you with the flexibility to accommodate diverse workloads within a low latency, accredited platform with native connectivity to non-cloud workloads in Crown Hosting, and the networks which are vital to the public sector; from PSN Protected to HSCN and RLI. All of this being provided with the benefit of localised and specialist support.

### What is End User Compute?

End User Compute (EUC) from UKCloud provides a streamlined approach to delivering, protecting and managing desktops and apps while containing costs and ensuring that end users can work anytime, anywhere, across any device.

EUC provides significant security and compliance benefits, whilst increasing workforce enablement through BYOD, and encouraging remote working, without compromising application availability, security and compliance.

### What is Private Cloud for Oracle Software?

Private Cloud for Oracle Software enables organisations to have private implementations of Oracle Cloud at Customer, Exadata Cloud at Customer, Oracle Big Data Cloud at Customer, or Exadata Engineered Systems within UKCloud's assured, sovereign data centres. You can then connect your Oracle Cloud applications to the non-Oracle workloads that you have within the rest of the multi-cloud ecosystem.

This includes connectivity to UKCloud for OpenStack, UKCloud for Microsoft Azure, UKCloud for VMware, as well as UKCloud for Oracle Software which can support legacy x86-based Oracle workloads.
