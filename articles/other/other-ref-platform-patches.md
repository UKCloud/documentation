To enable customers to better plan using the UKCloud platform, this article provides further details about the current, supported and future versions for some of the elements that are used to deliver the platform.

This article is designed to give customers insight into what is supported, the next known version (along with a planned update path) and notes about the next version â€“ such as incompatibility with other parts of the UKCloud platform.

This list will be updated in line with planned maintenance when new versions of components become available which have been tested on the UKCloud platform.  

Due to the nature of the cloud service that UKCloud delivers, we are unable to guarantee where in the cloud your workloads will be running, or on which parts of the estate. Equally, when we make changes to the components, these will be platform-wide changes. Any potentially disruptive changes will be notified as planned maintenance as per the terms detailed in the product service description.

Compute Platform as of March 2018:
