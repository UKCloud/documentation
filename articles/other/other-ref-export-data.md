# Methods for exporting data

## Overview

This guide provides some general information about how you can export data away from the UKCloud platform. You have access to copy or export your data at any point in life working with UKCloud and further options may exist that are not covered here.

## Before you begin

You can package and export your data in a number of different ways, however we recommend that you read the following documents:

- [Blueprint: Exporting and importing vApps and vApp templates](https://ukcloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ukc-gen-136-exporting-and-importing-vapps-and-vapp-templates-blueprint-v2.pdf) - A technical case for transfer of data in UKCloud for VMware

- [Getting Started Guide for Cloud Storage](../cloud-storage/cs-gs.md) - Covers the use APIs for access to our storage service

## Exporting data

You can use any of the following methods to export data:

- Internet, government secure network or leased line data copy

- Data load room (self-service)

- Data load room (UKCloud SFIA)

- Customer-hosted equipment

### Internet, government secure network or leased line data copy

All customers have some form of connectivity to the UKCloud platform to consume services, whether that be an internet facing connection or through one of the approved or government secure network connections. These connections are used for the management of services and may also have been used for copying data to the UKCloud platform. Therefore, the first option for exporting data is to make use of these existing connections.

### Data load room (self-service)

If you want to make use of UKCloud's facilities, we maintain a data room where you can access both the Assured and Elevated security domains by appointment. Your staff or assigned representatives can attend site for a pre-booked number of days and copy data to the provided machines, with the expectation that this data is then moved onto removable media, for example USB hard disks, to be transported.

For more information about booking and using this service, see the [Data Transfer Facility Service Scope](../enablement/enbl-sco-dtf.md).

### Data load room (UKCloud SFIA)

Similar to the self service option, this option copies data from your environment to, typically, removable media provided by you.

For more information about booking and using this service, see the [Data Transfer Facility Service Scope](../enablement/enbl-sco-dtf.md).

### Customer-hosted equipment

Where you have hosted equipment at a UKCloud data centre for part of the solution, for example the hosting of communications equipment, you can also leverage this in a similar way to the data load room. If you have equipment hosted at UKCloud, you may request access using a normal Service Request via the [My Calls](https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/support/ivanti) section of the UKCloud Portal.
