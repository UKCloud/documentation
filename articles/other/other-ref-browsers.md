# System requirements for services on the UKCloud platform

## Overview

This article outlines various system requirements for UKCloud services.

## Browser requirements

To get the best interaction with the UKCloud platform, it's important to use a browser that's compatible with all aspects of the services with which you interact.

### UKCloud for VMware

> [!NOTE]
> You must enable Flash in your browser to access the vCloud Director Legacy UI (Web Console).

> [!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Edge browser does not support plugins, so functions such as console redirection and OVF upload using the Legacy UI do not work with Edge. To perform these functions, you must use a different browser.

#### vCloud Director 9.7

vCloud Director 9.7 is compatible with the current and last major browser revisions. Version 9.7 of vCloud Director was tested by VMware and supports:

- Google Chrome 72.0.3626.109

- Mozilla Firefox 60.5.1ESR

- Microsoft Edge 42.17134.1.0

- Microsoft Internet Explorer 11.590.171340

#### vCloud Director 9.1

vCloud Director 9.1 is compatible with many current and last major browser revisions. Version 9.1 of vCloud Director was tested by VMware and supports:

- Google Chrome 64

- Mozilla Firefox 58

- Microsoft Edge 41

- Microsoft Internet Explorer 11

> [!NOTE]
> Although Internet Explorer is supported by vCloud Director 9.1, if you've applied any security or group policy restrictions, you may encounter problems.

### UKCloud for OpenStack

UKCloud for OpenStack is powered by OpenStack and uses the Horizon project to provide its dashboard capabilities. Horizon is built around modern HTML5 standards and requires no auxiliary plugins to operate. Therefore, it is compatible with all latest browser versions.

### UKCloud for Microsoft Azure

Interaction with UKCloud for Microsoft Azure is through the Azure Stack portal. Microsoft recommends using the most up-to-date browser for your operating system.

### Cloud GPU

Cloud GPU has the same browser requirements as [UKCloud for VMware](#ukcloud-for-vmware).

### High Performance Compute

High Performance Compute has the same browser requirements as [UKCloud for VMware](#ukcloud-for-vmware).

### Email and Collaboration as a Service

For the most up to date list of supported browsers for Email and Collaboration as a Service, refer to the [*Zimbra Collaboration Supported Systems*](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/8.7.0/Supported_Systems) document.

- Firefox and Chrome on Windows, Mac, Linux

- Internet Explorer on Windows

- Safari on Mac and Windows

## Software versions

It is your responsibility to ensure that you are using supported versions of any software that you install in your environment on the UKCloud platform. If you encounter issues that relate to old and out-of-support versions of software, although we'll make our best efforts to assist, we cannot guarantee that we'll be able to resolve those issues. We reserve the right to request that any out-of-support software be updated before working on support tickets.
