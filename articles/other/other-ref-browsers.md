# Browser requirements for services on the UKCloud platform

## Overview

To get the best interaction with the UKCloud platform, it's important to use a browser that is compatible with all aspects of the services with which you interact.

This document outlines the browser requirement for UKCloud services.

## UKCloud for VMware

For UKCloud for VMware, vCloud Director 9.1 is compatible with many current and last major browser revisions.
Version 9.1 of vCloud Director was tested by VMware and supports:

- Google Chrome 64
- Mozilla Firefox 58
- Microsoft Edge 41
- Microsoft Internet Explorer 11

> [!NOTE]
> You must enable Flash in your browser to access the vCloud Director Web Console.

> [!NOTE]
> The Edge browser does not support plugins, so functions such as console redirection and OVF upload using the legacy UI do not work with Edge. To perform these functions, you must use a different browser.

> [!NOTE]
> Although Internet Explorer is supported by vCloud Director 9.1, if you've applied any security or group policy restrictions, you may encounter problems.

## UKCloud for OpenStack

UKCloud for OpenStack is powered by OpenStack and uses the Horizon project to provide its dashboard capabilities. Horizon is built around modern HTML5 standards and requires no auxiliary plugins to operate. Therefore, it is compatible with all latest browser versions.
