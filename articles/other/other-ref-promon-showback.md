# Protective Monitoring information in the UKCloud Portal

## Overview

This document describes what showback information you can view in the UKCloud Portal about the different clouds, networks and security domains supported by UKCloud's Protective Monitoring service.

The document also includes examples of the security events that are displayed in the Portal and what you should do when you see an incident.

You can find UKCloud's Protective Monitoring Portal showback information on the *My Security Events* page. To view this page, you must have **Read** monitoring permissions on the page.
