# Free Trials Service Scope

## About free trials

This document describes the boundaries of the free trial, along with the responsibilities required of both UKCloud and our customers to facilitate free trials.

Free trials provide you with a live environment on the UKCloud platform to test our services and validate that they are suited to your needs.

Prior to your trial, you will be engaged by a Cloud Architect to identify the goals you are working towards, and to ensure that your trial meets them.

Throughout the trial period, we will assign you a Customer Success Manager (CSM), who will provide support for any issues you may encounter or questions you may have.

At the end of your free trial, you can seamlessly move to a billed service, leveraging any of the work you have already completed in the live trial environment.

## Excluded Products and services

Exclusions are:

- Cross Domain Security Zone

- Secure Remote Access

- Basic Managed VM

- HSCN, unless you already have an HSCN connection

- Services covered by the [*SFIA Rate Card*](https://ukcloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ukc-gen-759-ukcloud-g-cloud-11-standard-rate-card-and-definitions.pdf)

- Dedicated Compute option in UKCloud for VMware

- Private Cloud for Compute

- Private Cloud for Storage

- Private Cloud for Oracle Software

- Products in alpha or beta testing - these will be treated differently to free trials

## Key Aspects of a Free Trial

Free trials are:

- Available to both new and existing customers

- Available for 30 days from first use; any longer will be at our discretion or detailed in the Service Scope

- Available only for products that you haven't previously purchased or trialed

- Available in both security domains (providing an established connection into the Elevated security domain is in place)

- Not available for any products and services you are already consuming, unless you are testing a significantly different use case or, if you are a partner, testing a solution for a different customer

- Trials are excluded from any SLA credits

## How does the free trial work?

Requesting a trial:

- Request via UKCloud website: <https://www.ukcloud.com/free-trial-sign-up>, where you will need to accept the [trial terms and conditions](https://ukcloud.com/free-trial-terms-and-conditions/)

- Your environment is set up

- You are given trial credits to the equivalent of £500, unless stated differently in the Service Scope

During your trial:

- Use your credits for any eligible service within your environment within 30 days, unless stated differently in the Service Scope

- Contact your CSM with any issues or questions

Ending your trial

- You will be contacted by your Cloud Architect or CSM when your trial is due to end, either because you have run out of credits or reached 30 days (whichever is sooner)

- You have the option to transition to production or cease the trial
