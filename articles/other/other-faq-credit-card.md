# Credit card payment FAQs

## General

### What services can I use when signing up with my credit or debit card?

Currently only UKCloud for VMware is available when signing up with a credit or debit card. If you want to try other services, you can talk to our Sales Rep, who will be in contact shortly after you sign up to discuss your requirements and ongoing engagement with UKCloud. Alternatively, you can email <salesenquiries@ukcloud.com> with additional requests.

### When will the limit on my account be removed?

When signing up with a credit or debit card, your account is initially limited as follows:

- A maximum of 10 ESSENTIAL UKCloud for VMware VMs
- A maximum of 500GB storage (250GB Tier 1 and 250GB Tier 2)
- You'll be unable to create additional VMware vOrgs and VDCs
- Support is limited to issues with the sign-up process itself

These limits will be removed once a Sales Rep has successfully qualified your account, having contacted you, verified your organisation entity and discussed your requirements.

### What if my account is not qualified?

If your account is not qualified then, as per our [terms and conditions](https://ukcloud.com/onlinetermsandconditions), we reserve the right to decommission your account.

### How much free credit will I get?

You'll receive £100 free credit when signing up with a credit or debit card. Any consumption after the free credit will be charged.

### What level of support will I receive when I sign up with a credit or debit card?

Once the limit on your account has been removed, you'll be entitled to our standard level of support, which is described in [*How to raise and escalate service requests*](../portal/ptl-how-raise-escalate-service-request.md). Support is not available until the limit is removed, except if your issues are with the sign-up process itself.

### I could not complete the sign-up process, how do I get help?

Email <signup@ukcloud.com> if you have issues with the sign-up process.

### How do I leave UKCloud?

For information about how to terminate your service with UKCloud, see [*Terminating your UKCloud services*](other-ref-offboarding.md).

### My credit or debit card details have changed, how do I update them with UKCloud?

Email <invoicing@ukcloud.com> if your details have changed. UKCloud will then call you to take your new card details. Do not send us your new credit card details by post or email.

### I want to sign up to UKCloud as a personal customer, how can I do that?

We do not currently support personal customers. This is something we may consider in the future.
