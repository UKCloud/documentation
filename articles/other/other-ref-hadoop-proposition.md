# Big Data & Hadoop Service Proposition

## Overview

Organisations are creating data at an unprecedented rate. New technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, smart devices and cities and Artificial Intelligence generate data with such fierce velocity and volume that traditional processing is unable to provide information from this data quick enough to provide the fullest business value.

Hadoop is an open source collection of tools designed specifically to capture, store and process this new wave of data in a cost-effective way, while also facilitating high speed data aggregation and analytics that provide organisations with valuable insights.

## How can UKCloud help?

Using our UKCloud for OpenStack service, coupled with specialised skills from Bluemetrix, we have a proven mechanism to successfully deliver Hadoop to our customers on a consumption basis without them having to undertake the complexities of Hadoop cluster design, implementation or support.

For full details of our proposition, including packaging and pricing, how to request the service, roles and responsibilities and frequently asked questions, see the [_Big Data & Hadoop Service Proposition_](https://ukcloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ukc-svc-124-ukcloud-hadoop-proposition.pdf) on the UKCloud website.
