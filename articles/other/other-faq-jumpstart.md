# Jumpstart FAQs

## General

### What is Jumpstart?

Jumpstart is a service providing skilled engineers and architects, on an hourly or daily basis, who can help design and build UKCloud solutions for you.

### How is Jumpstart different from UKCloud’s standard support services?

UKCloud’s standard support services are limited to ensuring the availability and performance of services such as UKCloud for VMware or UKCloud for OpenStack. For example, UKCloud engineers will not usually log in to a customer environment or configure services at the operating system level. In addition, UKCloud’s pre-sales resources, such as Cloud Architects, provide high-level design services only. Jumpstart provides you with dedicated resources to undertake low-level design work and is a hands-on implementation activity.

### What kind of things can Jumpstart help me with?

Jumpstart is a flexible service that you can use for a wide range of projects. Some examples of recent projects where Jumpstart has helped include:

- Configuring IPSec connectivity to UKCloud

- Building a highly available SQL cluster

- Creating an Active Directory domain

- Building Terraform / Ansible templates for OpenStack

- Setting up global load balancing services

- Preparing applications for deployment to OpenShift

### What will UKCloud be responsible for?

Jumpstart is designed to provide additional skills and resources during the build phase of a project. Note that Jumpstart does not provide an ongoing support service. You should either have, or plan to have, the relevant skills to support the service following the conclusion of the Jumpstart activity.

### How can I order Jumpstart?

For existing customers, you can raise a ticket in the UKCloud Portal requesting access to Jumpstart services. If you are not already a UKCloud customer, you should first discuss Jumpstart with an Account Director or Cloud Architect.

### What do I need to do before my project can start?

It's important that any prerequisites such as cloud environment deployment, connectivity and assurance activities are completed prior to a Jumpstart engineer commencing work. Your Jumpstart engineer will discuss these prerequisites during the initial kick-off call or meeting. We will create a pre-flight checklist to track progress against these activities.

### How do I know what my Jumpstart engineer is working on?

Prior to commencing a Jumpstart engagement, the engineer will estimate the tasks involved and the time it may take to complete them. Once the engagement commences, the engineer will record actual time used against these estimates. Your Jumpstart consultant will happily share this information with you at any time during the engagement to keep you informed.

### How much does the Jumpstart service cost?

Both the consultancy and engineering time for the Jumpstart service is sold in packs of four days at a price of £3500. This equates to 32 hours of Jumpstart time. 

### When will I be billed?

You will be billed for Jumpstart hours consumed during the month at the end of each month.

### What happens if I don’t use up all of the time I purchased?

It is common to have some time remaining at the end of a Jumpstart engagement. You can use this time on-demand for up to one year following the initial Jumpstart order. Common uses for this time include help, advice and modifications. Note though that there is no SLA associated with Jumpstart and it is not designed to be used as a support service.

### How can I re-engage a jumpstart consultant after a period of inactivity?

During the initial period of a Jumpstart engagement the project is considered to be active. During an active Jumpstart, your project will be scheduled as part of an engineer’s workload and they will be available to spend time on your project at short notice. Once a Jumpstart project enters an inactive state you'll then need to raise a ticket in the Portal to re-engage an engineer. Quick activities (typically one hour or less) will usually be dealt with quickly while longer activities will need scheduling into an engineer’s workload.
