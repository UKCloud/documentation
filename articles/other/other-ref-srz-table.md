# Sites, regions and zones map and reference table

To assist you in understanding the concept of sites, regions and zones within the UKCloud platform, this article identifes which zones exist in each region, and which site each region resides in.

There are also two other articles in the Knowledge Centre that accompany this article and assist in explaining the Sites, regions and zones concept:

- [*Understanding Sites, regions and zones*](other-ref-sites-regions-zones.md)

- [*UKCloud services by region*](other-ref-services-by-region.md)
