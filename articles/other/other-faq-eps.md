# Enterprise & Private Sector FAQs

## General

### What do we define as Enterprise & Private Sector customers?

Commercial organisations in the Private Sector, especially those in regulated industries that want the choice (no technology or contractual lock-in), assurance (sovereignty and security) and award-winning expertise (customer services) of the UKCloud platform.

### Which products/services are available to Enterprise & Private Sector organisations?

All products and services will be available except for Cross Domain Security Zone, Secure Remote Access, connectivity to public sector networks and access to the Elevated and Tier 2 security domains.

### Can non-UK companies purchase UKCloud services?

Yes. A number of our existing non-UK partners utilise our services for use within the UK for UK-based customers and transactions in line with UK data regulations.

### Can Enterprise & Private Sector organisations use Crown Campus?

No. Crown Hosting is designed specifically and exclusively for use by the UK Public Sector and so Crown Campus will not be relevant to Enterprise & Private Sector organisations. The Private Sector is able to procure space directly from Ark, and so UKCloud will be able to deliver equivalent private cloud and hybrid cloud solutions between Ark data rooms and the UKCloud platform.

### Can Enterprise & Private Sector customers use the Elevated security domain for sensitive data?

No. The Elevated security domain and the Tier 2 security domain are designed to be used only by Public Sector organisations as they are connected to restricted government networks. Enterprise & Private Sector customers can use only the Assured security domain, which is connected to our DDoS-protected internet service, and hence they should design and architect a secure workload to safeguard their data in the same way that Public Sector customers have done.

### What are your service SLAs?

All of our services have formal SLAs supported by service credits. As there is a specific SLA for each service, please review the specific Service Definition which are available in our [Knowledge Centre](https://docs.ukcloud.com/articles/other/other-ref-service-definitions.html).

### Will Enterprise & Private Sector customers share the same estate as UK Public Sector?

Yes. The UKCloud platform has been designed and has evolved to support all types of workloads with a high level of security, resilience and performance. Data and customer separation of workloads is a fundamental part of our solution and therefore, there are no reasons why the two communities cannot share the same platform. There are some exceptions; Private Sector customers will not be able to access the following services:

- Elevated and Tier 2 security domains

- Cross Domain Security Zone

- Secure Remote Access

- Government community networks (unless sponsored by a public-sector organisation as part of a solution)

### Are IPv6 addresses available?

We are not currently able to support IPv6, although this is on our technical roadmap. Please contact our technical teams to discuss this further if it a requirement for your solution.

## Pricing & ordering

### What pricing is available for Enterprise & Private Sector customers?

We'll apply the rebate by crediting your next monthly invoice by the amount you have applied for.

### Where do I find pricing?

All of our UKCloud Service Definitions, Pricing Guide and Terms and Conditions are available from our [Knowledge Centre](https://docs.ukcloud.com/articles/other/other-ref-service-definitions.html), and are also linked from the Enterprise & Private Sector section of our [web site](https://ukcloud.com/sectors/enterprise-private-sector/). Note that the pricing guide includes some services, security domains and connectivity options that are available only to public sector customers.

### How do I order?

All of our customers, regardless of sector, can order the same way via our sales team who can be contacted by calling 01252 303300 (option 3) or by emailing <info@ukcloud.com>. There are also contact details on the Service Definitions and on the main web site *Contact us* page. We'll shortly be launching a new credit card-based order system and further details will be made available closer to the launch date.

### Can I pay with my credit card?

While a credit card payment option is not currently available, we are implementing this feature, which will be available soon.

### Are you able to supply licensing for use by Enterprise & Private Sector customers?

Yes. All of our licensing agreements are open to either Public or Private Sector customers, including Microsoft following their removal of G-SPLA where we now supply licenses using corporate SPLA.

### Do any UKCloud partners cater for Enterprise & Private Sector customers?

Yes. We have large ecosystem of partners, including large system integrators, popular managed service providers and specialist SaaS providers, who already deliver a wide range of services to both Public Sector and Private Sector.  Many of these partners share similar characteristics with UKCloud's platform and specialise in high security, excellent service and domain expertise. Contact us by calling 01252 303300 (option 3) or by emailing <info@ukcloud.com> for further information.
