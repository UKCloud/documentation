# Data Centre advance notice requirements

This article outlines the notice period for requests to visit the data centre and the process

## Advance notice period

For all requests to visit either our data centre in Farnborough or in Corsham to carry out maintenance / service existing hardware, the minimum advance notice period is 2 working days. Visitors to the data centre must have valid ID and have the combination code for the rack/s that are being accessed.

> [!NOTE]
> All visitors will be escorted during their visit.

## Creating a request to visit the data centre

To create a request to visit the data centre, raise a service request in the [My Calls](https://portal.ukcloud.com/support/ivanti) section of the UKCloud Portal.

For customers requiring a new installation of hardware into one of the data centres, a new request must be submitted via [My Calls](https://portal.ukcloud.com/support/ivanti) which will involve engagement with a UKCloud technical architect for design and to set up networking. Data centre access cannot be arranged until this review has been completed, so please advise us as soon as possible.
