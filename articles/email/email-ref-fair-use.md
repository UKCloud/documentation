# Email and Collaboration fair use policy

## Overview

This article outlines what is considered to be fair use of UKCloud's Email and Collaboration (Email) service.

## Policy scope

The Email and Collaboration fair use policy includes all UKCloud's Email services and any ancillary services that support or are under the product description of Email.

## Policy statements

Application of this policy:

1. The Email and Collaboration fair use policy ensures that all customers who use Email get a fair share of the use of that resource, and that no customer is disadvantaged by the conduct of others.

2. UKCloud can monitor Email volumes and ensure that customers do not excessively use the Email service. Examples of excessive use that may affect other customers include, but are not limited to:

    a. Sending more than 30 emails per minute from a single account, affecting the mail forwarding system.

    b. Retaining more than 1,000,000 emails within a single mailbox, affecting the system backup schedule.

3. UKCloud has the right to vary the terms of this Fair Use Policy at UKCloud's sole discretion.

4. UKCloud may rely on its Fair Use Policy where any customer's usage of the service is deemed to be causing disruption to other customers using the same service.

5. Where UKCloud identifies a customer's Email usage is disrupting other customers, UKCloud reserves the right to suspend specific customer Email accounts and ensure that fair use is maintained for all customers. UKCloud will then contact the customer and provide evidence showing the disruption to other users. UKCloud will work with the customer to identify ways to either utilise the resource in line with this policy or suggest a more appropriate product for their requirements. Examples of where UKCloud would demonstrate that a customer's email usage is disruptive to other customers could be:

    a. Metrics showing excessive queueing in mail forwarders where a customer's account(s) are shown to be sending more than 30 emails per minute.

    b. Metrics showing failed backups of the Email system, where the backup of the system database containing customer's account(s) can be seen failing 2 in 3 times.

6. This policy is supplementary to customer obligations outlined in any contract agreed between the two parties.

## Responsibilities

UKCloud will exercise its discretion and judgement in the administration of this policy.
