- **Password expiration** - Set passwords to expire after a specified number of days. This ensures that users change their passwords frequently. For more information, see [*How to set up password expiration*](ptl-how-setup-password-expiration.md).

- **Memorable word authentication** - Add an extra level of authentication whereby users provide letters from a memorable word as well as their password to confirm their identity. For more information, see [*How to enable memorable word authentication*](ptl-how-enable-memorable-word.md).

- **Google two-factor authentication (2FA)** - Add an extra level of authentication whereby users provide a security code from an authenticator app (such as Google Authenticator or Authy) as well as their password to confirm their identity. For more information, see [*How to enable two-factor authentication in the UKCloud Portal*](ptl-how-setup-2fa.md).

- **Portal access restriction by IP address** - Restrict access so that users can only log in to the Portal from specific IP addresses. For more information, see [*How to restrict access to the Portal*](ptl-how-restrict-access-portal.md).

- **vCloud Director API access restriction by IP address** - Restrict access so that users can only access the vCloud API from specific IP addresses. For more information, see [*How to restrict access to the vCloud API*](ptl-how-restrict-access-vcloud-api.md).
