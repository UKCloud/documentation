# How to use the My Calls Archive

## Overview

The My Calls Archive area of the UKCloud Portal provides access to older tickets raised using the previous version of My Calls.

### Intended audience

This guide is intended for any UKCloud Portal user who wants to use the *My Calls Archive* to monitor older support tickets. To complete the steps in this guide you must have access to the UKCloud Portal with the appropriate Portal permissions for Support. The tasks you can perform will depend on the level of permissions you have.

3. The **My Calls** tab is divided into two further tabs:

    - **Your Calls** lists all the support tickets (incident reports and service requests) that you have raised.

    - **Account Calls** lists all the support tickets that have been raised against the current customer account

4. By default, each tab lists 10 tickets per page. Use the **Show entries** list to display more tickets (up to 100 per page) if you prefer.
