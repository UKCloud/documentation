# How to create a new user in the UKCloud Portal

## Overview

You can create users in the UKCloud Portal to enable them to work with UKCloud services.

## Creating a new OpenStack user

To create a new user:

1. Log in to the UKCloud Portal

    For more detailed instructions, see the [*Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal*](ptl-gs.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > You must log in as a Portal administrator.

2. If necessary, switch to the account that creates the services you want the user to be able to access.

3. In the navigation panel, expand **Contacts**, then select **All Contacts**.

6. After you've created the user account, you can grant the user access to the different services available in the account. This process varies depending on the service:
