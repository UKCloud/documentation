# How to view login information

## Overview

The UKCloud Portal provides a report of who has logged into your account over the last 30 days. The report currently records the following activity against the account:

- User name

- Date and time

- Source IP address

> [!NOTE]
> To ensure appropriate segregation, if you have access to multiple accounts, you must switch accounts to view login information for each account.

## Viewing login history

1. Log into the UKCloud Portal.

2. In the navigation panel, click **Account** and then **Login history**.

3. The resulting table provides a list of all the users who have logged in to your environment over the last 30 days.

    The table indicates the name of the user, the date and time of each login and the IP address from which the login occurred. You can sort the results by user name, date or IP address.

4. Use the **Next** link at the bottom of the table to page through the results, or click a page number to go directly to that page.

    By default, the table lists 10 records at a time. You can use the drop down list at the top left of the table to increase the number of records shown per page to **25**, **50** or **100**.

5. Use the **Search** field to find a particular user or IP address.

6. To export the login data, click the **Actions** tab and choose **Export login history**.
