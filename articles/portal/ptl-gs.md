# Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal

## Overview

The UKCloud Portal is the gateway to your UKCloud services. In the Portal, you can:

- Raise and monitor support tickets

- View information about your UKCloud for VMware service, including virtual machine (VM) information, backup reports and build history

- Create compute services, virtual data centres (VDCs) and edge gateways within your UKCloud for VMware environment

- Access VMware Cloud Director to work with your UKCloud for VMware environment, for example to create and manage VMs, build VDC networks or configure your firewall

- Access the OpenStack Horizon dashboard to work with your UKCloud for OpenStack environment, for example to build your network infrastructure, set up access and security and launch instances

- Access the Azure Stack Hub portal to manage your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure environment, for example to create VMs

- View consumption information for your Cloud Storage service, reset secret keys and create new users

- View major incident (MI) notifications relating to the UKCloud platform

- View cyber security news

This Getting Started Guide provides an overview of the functionality available within the Portal.

## Intended audience

This Getting Started Guide is intended for any user with access to the Portal.

> [!NOTE]
> The options you can see and tasks you can perform within the Portal depend on the services available in your account and the permissions you've been granted by your Portal administrator.

## Before you begin

You should have received your Portal login credentials from your Portal administrator. If you're the Portal administrator, a member of the Service Delivery team will provide your login credentials.

The Portal works with Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox.

## Logging in to the UKCloud Portal

The first thing you need to do is log in.

1. Go to the appropriate URL, depending on the security domain in which your service is located:

    - **Assured OFFICIAL:** <https://portal.ukcloud.com>

    - **Elevated OFFICIAL:** Contact your Portal administrator, your Service Delivery Manager (or <servicedelivery@ukcloud.com>), or UKCloud Support (call 01252 303 300 and select option 2)

2. On the log in page, enter your credentials and click **Log in**.

    ![UKCloud Portal log in page](images/ptl-login.png)

    > [!TIP]
    > If you've forgotten your password, click the **Forgotten password?** link to request a password reset.

    If this is the first time you've logged in, use the temporary password you were given by your Portal administrator or the Service Delivery team. You'll be prompted to change this temporary password.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you incorrectly enter your password three times, you'll be prompted to enter a captcha code until you successfully log in. If you incorrectly enter the captcha code or your password another three times, a seventh unsuccessful login attempt will result in your account being locked. You'll need to contact your Portal administrator to unlock your account.

3. If your Portal administrator has enabled two-factor authentication (2FA), you'll be prompted to enter a six digit code. Use your 2FA app to generate the code and enter it here. (If this is the first time you've logged in, you'll be prompted to set up 2FA; see [*How to set up two-factor authentication for a user account*](ptl-how-setup-2fa.md)).

## Getting to know the UKCloud Portal

After you log in, you'll see the Portal *Home* page. A Portal page is made up of three main areas:

- Toolbar

- Navigation panel

- Content area

![UKCloud Portal home page](images/ptl-home-page.png)

### Toolbar

Each user account is associated with one or more customer accounts. Within the Portal, you can work within any customer account to which you have access. From the toolbar, you can switch between different customer accounts.

![Account menu](images/ptl-mnu-customer-account.png)

> [!NOTE]
> When you switch between accounts, you may be prompted to enter a 2FA code again if this additional security measure has been enabled by the Portal administrator of that account.

In the toolbar, you can also click your username to access the following options:

![User menu](images/ptl-mnu-user-account.png)

- **Notifications** - List all Portal notifications. Unread notifications are displayed in bold. Click the **View** button next to a notification to see more details. When you've finished reading a notification, select the **Notifications** tab to return to the list. If you want to quickly mark all your unread notifications as read, click the **Mark all as Read** button at the top of the page.

    > [!TIP]
    > The number next to the **Notifications** menu option (and next to your username in the toolbar) shows how many unread notifications you have.

- **Update contact details** - Change your name and telephone numbers, opt to have Portal notifications sent to your email address, or set a different email address to be used if you forget your password.

- **Change Password** - Change your password or memorable word. We recommend that you change your password at least every 90 days (see [*How to reset your UKCloud Portal password or memorable word*](ptl-how-reset-password.md)).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Your Portal administrator may have implemented a password expiration period; in which case, you'll be prompted to change your password after the specified number of days.

- **Two-Factor Auth** - Set up two-factor authentication (2FA) for your user account (see [*How to set up two-factor authentication for a user account*](ptl-how-setup-2fa.md)).

- **API** - View the information you need to use the Cloud Director API (see [*How to access VMware Cloud Director through the Coud Director API*](../vmware/vmw-how-access-vcloud-api.md)).

- **Feedback** - Send an email to UKCloud (<feedback@ukcloud.com>) with feedback on the Portal or any other aspect of your UKCloud experience.

- **Log out** - Log out of the Portal.

> [!TIP]
> Click the UKCloud logo in the toolbar on any page to return to the *Home* page. If you hover your mouse over the UKCloud logo, a tooltip displays the current Portal version.

### Navigation panel

The Portal navigation panel provides access to all the functionality available in the Portal.

### Content area

The content area displays the main content of the page. While the toolbar and navigation panel remain the same in most Portal pages, the content area changes depending on what task you're performing in the Portal. For example, the content area of the *Home* page contains a dashboard that provides quick access to various areas of the Portal, including notifications, My Calls and the Knowledge Centre.

## Logging out of the UKCloud Portal

When you've finished working in the Portal, we recommend that you log out to prevent unauthorised access.

> [!TIP]
> After 15 minutes of inactivity, you'll be automatically logged out.

1. In the toolbar, click your username.

2. From the menu, select **Log out**.

![Log out menu option](images/ptl-mnu-logout.png)

## Using the UKCloud Portal API

The Portal also provides an API to enable you to interact programmatically with your UKCloud environment. For example, you can use the Portal API to view information about the components of your environment and create compute services, VDCs and edge gateways.

The entry point URL for the Portal API is:

`https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/api`

For reference information about the various endpoints offered by the Portal API, see the [*UKCloud Portal API Reference Guide*](ptl-ref-portal-api.md).

For more information about how to use the API, including examples showing how to use the API to create a VDC and edge gateway, see [*How to use the UKCloud Portal API*](ptl-how-use-api.md).

## Next steps

In this Getting Started Guide, you've learned the basics about the Portal and the functionality it provides to help you interact with your UKCloud environment. For more details about a specific service, see the appropriate Getting Started Guide.
