# Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal

## Overview

The UKCloud Portal is the gateway to your UKCloud services. In the Portal, you can:

- View information about your UKCloud services, including UKCloud for VMware, UKCloud for OpenStack and Cloud Storage
- View notifications relating to the UKCloud platform
- Create compute services, virtual data centres (VDCs) and edge gateways within your UKCloud for VMware environment
- Access vCloud Director to work with your UKCloud for VMware environment, for example to create and manage virtual machines (VMs), build VDC networks or configure your firewall
- Raise and monitor support tickets
- Access Knowledge Centre articles to help you understand and work with the UKCloud platform

This Getting Started Guide provides an overview of the functionality available within the Portal.

### Intended audience

This Getting Started Guide is intended for any user with access to the Portal.

> [!NOTE]
> The options you can see and tasks you can perform within the Portal depend on the permissions you've been granted by your Portal administrator.

## Before you begin

You should have received your Portal login credentials from your Portal administrator. If you're the Portal administrator, your Customer Success Manager (CSM) will have provided you with your login credentials.

The Portal works with Google Chrome, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox. However, if you'll be using vCloud Director, we recommend that you use the Firefox ESR browser as this is also supported by the Web Console for the version of vCloud Director used by UKCloud for VMware.

**More information!** [*Browser requirements for services on the UKCloud platform*](https://portal.ukcloud.com/support/knowledge_centre/0887a898-826b-4605-9c2e-dcde0da06c00)

## Logging in to the UKCloud Portal

The first thing you need to do is log in.

1. Go to the appropriate URL, depending on the security domain in which your service is located:

    - **Assured OFFICIAL:** <https://portal.ukcloud.com>
    - **Elevated OFFICIAL:** <https://portal.ukcloud.gsi.gov.uk>

2. On the *Log in* page, enter your credentials and click **Sign in**.

    ![UKCloud Portal Log in page](images/ptl-login.png)

    If this is the first time you've logged in, use the temporary password you were given by your Portal administrator or CSM. You'll be prompted to change this temporary password.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you've forgotten your password, click the **Forgotten password?** link to request a password reset.

3. If your Portal administrator has enabled memorable word authentication or Google Two Factor Authentication (2FA), you'll be prompted for the second step of the authentication process.

    For example, for memorable word authentication, you'll be prompted to enter three randomlyâ€‘selected letters from your memorable word. (If this is the first time you've logged in, you'll be prompted to create a memorable word.)

    ![Memorable word dialog box](images/ptl-memorable-word.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you incorrectly enter your password three times, you'll be prompted to enter a captcha code until you successfully log in. If you incorrectly enter the captcha code or your password another three times, a seventh unsuccessful login attempt will result in your account being locked. You'll need to contact your Portal administrator to unlock your account.

## Getting to know the UKCloud Portal

After you log in, you'll see the Portal *Home* page. A Portal page is made up of three main areas:

- Toolbar
- Navigation panel
- Content area

![UKCloud Portal home page](images/ptl-home-page.png)

### Toolbar

Each user account is associated with one or more customer accounts. Within the Portal, you can work within any customer account to which you have access. From the toolbar, you can switch between different customer accounts.

![Account menu](images/ptl-mnu-customer-account.png)

> [!NOTE]
> When you switch between accounts, you may be prompted to enter letters from your memorable word again if this additional security measure has been enabled by your Portal administrator.

In the toolbar, you can also click your username to access the following options:

![User menu](images/ptl-mnu-user-account.png)

- **Notifications** --- List all Portal notifications. Unread notifications are displayed in bold. Click the **View** button next to a notification to see more details. When you've finished reading a notification, select the **Notifications** tab to return to the list. If you want to quickly mark all your unread notifications as read, click the **Mark all as Read** button at the top of the page.

    > [!TIP]
    > The number next to the **Notifications** menu option (and next to your username in the toolbar) shows how many unread notifications you have.

- **Update contact details** --- Change your name, email address and telephone numbers. You can also opt to have Portal notifications sent to your email address.

- **Change Password** --- Change your password or memorable word. We recommend that you change your password at least every 90 days (see [*How to reset your UKCloud Portal password or     memorable word*](https://portal.ukcloud.com/support/knowledge_centre/d2a8e8aa-2eb3-4fbb-a2b7-abde91f68cb7)).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Your Portal administrator may have implemented a password expiration period; in which case, you'll be prompted to change your password after the specified number of days.

- **API** --- View the information you need to use the vCloud API (see [*How to access vCloud Director through the vCloud API*](https://portal.ukcloud.com/support/knowledge_centre/0e0865ef-b6c5-4664-ab85-2d9f5cfe54c0)).

- **Feedback** --- Send an email to UKCloud with feedback on the Portal or any other aspect of your UKCloud experience.

- **Log out** --- Log out of the Portal.

> [!TIP]
> Click the UKCloud logo in the toolbar on any page to return to the *Home* page. If you hover your mouse over the UKCloud logo, a tooltip displays the current Portal version.

2. From the menu, select **Log out**.

![Log out menu option](images/ptl-mnu-logout.png)

## Using the UKCloud Portal API

The Portal also provides an API to enable you to interact programmatically with your UKCloud environment. For example, you can use the Portal API to create, manage and monitor support tickets, view information about the components of your environment and create compute services, virtual data centres and edge gateways.

The entry point URL for the Portal API is:

https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/api

For reference information about the various endpoints offered by the Portal API, see the [*Portal API User Guide*](https://portal.ukcloud.com/support/knowledge_centre/c931089a-009b-4fe3-af8e-36ba75cb1c76).

For more information about how to use the API, including examples showing how to use the API to create a VDC and edge gateway, see [*How to use the UKCloud Portal API*](https://portal.ukcloud.com/support/knowledge_centre/18ec05eb-0271-4ff0-bb10-f377a2f29af7).
