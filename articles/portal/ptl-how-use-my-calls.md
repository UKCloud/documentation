# How to use My Calls in the UKCloud Portal

The *My Calls* area of the UKCloud Portal is a oneâ€‘stop place to raise new support tickets (incidents and requests) with UKCloud and monitor existing tickets.

*My Calls* covers the ITIL standards of:

- Raising faults and outages (incidents)

- Raising service requests, for example, to request service or system information, restore backups or request logs

### Intended audience

To complete the steps in this article, you must have access to the UKCloud Portal with the appropriate Portal permissions for Support. The tasks you can perform will depend on the level of permissions you have.

    - **Outstanding Items** lists the support tickets (incident and service requests) that you can view, depending on your permissions. You can also see support tickets by selecting the **My Items** tab.

    - **Report List** provides customer related reporting around tickets (coming soon).

    - **Log an Incident using Template** provides templates for you to use to raise tickets. You can also see incident templates by selecting the **Service Catalog** tab.

    - **Top 5 Service Catalogue Offerings** lists the most popular service catalogue offerings to provide a quick way to raise a request. To see all request offerings, select the **Service Catalog** tab.

## Raising a support ticket

If you want to request a new service, make changes to an existing service or request information, use the Service Catalogue to raise a service request. If you need to notify UKCloud of an incident, use an incident template to raise an incident.

1. In *My Calls*, select the **Service Catalog** tab.

    ![The Service Catalogue tab in My Calls](images/ptl-mycalls-tab-catalogue.png)

2. Search the *Service Catalog* for the request offering or incident type you'd like to raise. You can browse by product type or most popular or enter keywords to search for.

    > [!TIP]
    > There is a generic incident template if you cannot find anything that matches what you're looking for.

    ![Service Catalog tab](images/ptl-mycalls-service-catalogue.png)

3. Select the request or incident form that you want to use.

4. Complete the fields in the form with as much information as possible so that our Support Team can address your ticket promptly.

5. When you're done, click **Review & Submit**.

    ![Review & Submit button in request form](images/ptl-mycalls-request-submit.png)

    > [!NOTE]

## Monitoring an existing support ticket

After raising a support ticket, you can view the ticket to monitor progress, add more information, add attachments, close or cancel the ticket.

> [!NOTE]
> The actions you can perform on a ticket depend on your Support permissions. You will always be able to update support tickets that you have raised. If you have the **Account Tickets** or **My Calls Admin** permissions, you can also view and edit tickets raised by other users on the account.

1. In *My Calls*, select the **My Items** tab.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can filter the list of users or use the search field to find a specific user.

3. Select the permission level you want to apply to the user: My Tickets, Account Tickets or My Calls Admin.

     The options offered will depend on the current role assigned to the user. Each user can have only one permission level, so the role you select here replaces any previous permissions.
