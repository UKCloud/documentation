# How to use My Calls in the UKCloud Portal

## Overview

The My Calls area of the UKCloud Portal is a oneâ€‘stop place to raise new support tickets with UKCloud and monitor existing tickets.

The My Calls feature covers the ITIL standards of:

- Raising faults and outages
- Raising service requests, for example, to request service or system information, restore backups or request logs
- Raising change requests, for example, to request a new virtual data centre (VDC), provision a new service or perform initial service set up

For faults and outages, raise an incident report. For more information, see [Raising a new incident report](#raising-a-new-incident-report).

For service and change requests, raise a service request. For more information, see [Raising a new service request](#raising-a-new-service-request).

### Intended audience

This guide is intended for any UKCloud Portal user who wants to use *My Calls* to raise or monitor a support ticket. To complete the steps in this guide you must have access to the UKCloud Portal with the appropriate Portal permissions for Support. The tasks you can perform
will depend on the level of permissions you have.
