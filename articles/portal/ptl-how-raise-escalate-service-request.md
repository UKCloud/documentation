# How to raise and escalate incidents and service requests

## Contacting UKCloud

Service support hours are:

Ticket priority | Support hours
----------------|--------------
**P1 incident** | 24 x 7
**P2 to P4 incident** | Monday to Friday from 0800 to 2000 (excluding bank holidays)
**Service requests (all)** | Monday to Friday from 0800 to 2000 (excluding bank holidays)

### During service hours

Customers should ensure they complete basic checks before contacting UKCloud, and the individual contacting UKCloud should have sufficient knowledge to be able to respond to requests for information and assistance.

Methods for contacting The UKCloud team are as follows:

- UKCloud Portal (Assured) &mdash; <https://portal.ukcloud.com/login>
- UKCloud Portal (Elevated) &mdash; <https://portal.ukcloud.gsi.gov.uk/login>
- Telephone &mdash; 01252 303 300 (select option 2)

The UKCloud Portal is the preferred approach for raising requests and issues with UKCloud.

Customers are asked to provide the following:

- Company details and contact details
- A detailed description of the problem or issue
- Relevant log files, configuration files and supporting information
- Captured screen shots

Customers can contact Support via email at <support@ukcloud.com>, although, as we are unable to carry out user verification via this method, email should not be used to raise support tickets.

## Incident and service request logging and assignment process

### First contact

Initial contact should always be via the UKCloud Portal unless this is unavailable or the customer is experiencing an outage and would like immediate support, in which case contact should be via phone.

### Triage

All requests and incidents are sent to triage for initial review to assess that sufficient details have been provided, for example:

- Correct priority/severity
- Contact details have been provided
- Clear description of issue or request is included

Where details are missing, we'll seek clarification.

### Assignment

Tickets are assigned to a Cloud Support Engineer (CSE) who will engage with the customer to provide assistance.

## Customer service targets

Your experience is important to us. We measure our performance against service targets across our customers to ensure that we provide you with a service you can trust.

Ticket priority | Initial response target | Resolution target
----------------|-------------------------|------------------
**P1 incident** | 15 minutes | 90% in 12 hours
**P2 incident** | 1 hour | 90% in 24 hours
**P3 incident** | 1 hour | 90% in 5 days
**P4 incident** | 1 hour | 90% in 5 days
**Service request** | 1 hour | 2 days (standard pre-approved requests)

## Incident priorities

&nbsp; | &nbsp;
-----------|-----------
**Priority 1** | **Priority 2**
A significant outage or disruption to multiple users or locations is in progress</br></br>Compromise, loss or unavailability of data has occurred</br></br>Suspected or potential compromise, loss or unavailability of data | Service is available but degraded or restricted for multiple users or locations
**Priority 3** | **Priority 4**
A failure or degradation of redundant or non-critical components of service has occurred</br></br>Failure of a shared service, where alternative services remain available, or service disruption for single users | Documented housekeeping activities</br></br>Administration related requirements or an uncategorised incident

## Viewing tickets and service updates

All incidents and service requests are visible within the UKCloud Portal under My Calls. The Portal is also used to provide notification of upcoming changes.

During a Major Incident, updates are published to the Service Status page: <http://status.ukcloud.com/>.
