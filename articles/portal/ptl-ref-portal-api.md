# UKCloud Portal API Reference Guide

## Overview

This is an application programmer's guide designed for those wanting to interact with the UKCloud Portal via use of an application programming interface (API).

We will update this document with API calls as they become available.

## Accessing the Portal API

The entry point URL for the Portal API is:

`https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/api`

For information and examples about how to use the Portal API, see [*How to use the UKCloud Portal API*](ptl-how-use-api.md).

## Response HTTP status codes

200 | All OK
201 | Created resource OK
202 | Accepted
400 | Bad request
401 | Authorization error
403 | Forbidden
404 | URL resource not found
422 | Unprocessable entity
500 | Error with operation

## POST /api/authenticate
