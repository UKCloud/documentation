# How to reset your UKCloud Portal password or memorable word

## Resetting your own password or memorable word

In the event that you need to change your password or memorable word for access to the UKCloud Portal, please follow these steps:

1. Log in to the UKCloud Portal as usual.

2. At the top right-hand corner, click your user name, and select **Change password**.

3. Change your details as required and click **Save**.

## Resetting another user's password or memorable word

If a user forgets their password or memorable word, an administrator can reset them:

1. Log in to the UKCloud Portal as an administrator.

2. In the navigation panel, expand **Contacts** then select **All contacts**.

3. Locate the user and click the **Edit** button for that user.

4. Select the **Edit contact** tab, then the **User** tab.

5. Update the password and/or memorable word as required.

6. Click **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> For users of the Elevated OFFICIAL Portal, any changes to a user password or memorable word must be completed by an administrator.

In the event that an administrator requires a password or memorable word reset, and no other administrators are available, please contact UKCloud Support on 01252 303300 and select option 2.
