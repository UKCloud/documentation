# How to set up two-factor authentication for a user account

## Overview

If your Portal administrator has enabled two-factor authentication (2FA) in the UKCloud Portal, you must enter a randomly generated code, as well as your user name and password, when logging in to the Portal.

The first time you log into the Portal after 2FA is enabled, you'll need to to set up 2FA for your user account by registering your account with an authenticator app, such as Google Authenticator.

## Setting up 2FA

When you first log in to a Portal account that has 2FA enabled, you'll be prompted to set up 2FA:

1. Log in to the UKCloud Portal, providing your user name and password as usual, and memorable word, if required.

    For more detailed instructions, see the [*Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal*](ptl-gs.md).

2. Per the instructions in the *Configure your two-factor authentication* dialog box, install an authenticator app and scan the provided QR code.

3. When you've installed and set up your authenticator app, enter the 6 digit code provided by the app in the *Configure your two-factor authentication* dialog box and click **Confirm code** to log in to the Portal.

4. For future logins to the Portal, use your authenticator app to generate a 2FA code to confirm your identity and complete the log in process.
