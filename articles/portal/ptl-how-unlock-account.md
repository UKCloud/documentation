# How to unlock a user account

## Overview

A user account may be locked after too many failed login attempts. A locked user account must be unlocked by a Portal administrator.

## Intended audience

To complete the steps in this guide you must be a Portal administrator.

## Unlocking a user account

If a user incorrectly enters their password three times, they'll be prompted to enter a captcha code until they successfully log in. If the user then incorrectly enters the captcha code or password another three  times, a seventh unsuccessful login attempt will result in the account being locked.

A locked user account must be unlocked by a Portal administrator.

To unlock a user account:

1. Log in to the UKCloud Portal.

    For more detailed steps, see the [*Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal*](ptl-gs.md).

2. In the navigation panel, expand the **Contacts** option and then select **All Contacts**.
