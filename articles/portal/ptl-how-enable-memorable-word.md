# How to enable memorable word authentication

## Overview

The UKCloud Portal login process offers an additional level of authentication through a memorable word. If you enable this feature, when users login to the Portal, after entering their password they are also prompted for a random combination of letters from their memorable word.

## Enabling memorable word authentication

To enable memorable word authentication:

1. Log in to the UKCloud Portal as an administrator

    For more detailed instructions, see the [*Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal*](ptl-gs.md).

2. If necessary, switch to the account for which you want to change the security settings.

3. In the navigation panel, select **Settings**.

## Enabling memorable word on account switch

You can extend your use of the memorable word feature to also prompt users for letters from their memorable word when they switch to this account from a different account within the Portal.

1. Select the **Prompt for memorable word check on account switch** check box.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you cannot see the **Prompt for memorable word check on account switch** check box, this means that you've not yet enabled memorable word authentication for the account (see [*Enabling memorable word authentication*](#enabling-memorable-word-authentication)).

2. When you're done, click **Save**.

3. To disable memorable word authentication on account switch, deselect the **Prompt for memorable word check on account switch** check box.

## Excluding users from memorable word authentication

You can disable memorable word authentication on login for specific users if required.

> [!NOTE]
> If you've enabled memorable word on account switch, users will still be prompted for letters from their memorable word when switching to the account.

1. In the *Excluded users* section, click **Add user**.

2. Start entering the email address of the user you want to exclude from memorable word authentication, then select the user from the presented list.
