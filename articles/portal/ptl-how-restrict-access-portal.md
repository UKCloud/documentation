# How to restrict access to the UKCloud Portal

## Overview

You can restrict access to the UKCloud Portal by creating a whitelist of acceptable IP addresses. This helps to prevent access to the Portal from unauthorised sources as users will only be able to log in to the Portal if their request originates from an IP address on the whitelist.

> [!NOTE]
> When specifying IP addresses, you must use individual IP addresses. You cannot restrict access to groups of IP addresses, for example by range or subnet.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be careful when entering IP addresses. Entering the wrong address may make the Portal inaccessible and you will be unable to change the settings. If you lose access to the Portal, contact UKCloud Support.

## Restricting access to the Portal

To restrict access to the Portal:

1. Log in to the UKCloud Portal as an administrator.

    For more detailed instructions, see the [*Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal*](ptl-gs.md).

2. If necessary, switch to the account for which you want to change the security settings.

3. In the navigation panel, select **Settings**.
