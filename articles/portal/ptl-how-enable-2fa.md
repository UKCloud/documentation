# How to enable two-factor authentication in the UKCloud Portal

## Overview

To provide additional security, you may want to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) in the UKCloud Portal. 2FA requires that users enter a randomly generated code, as well as their user name and password, when logging in to the Portal.

To set up 2FA, a Portal administrator must first enable 2FA for the Portal account. After enabling 2FA for the account, the next time a user attempts to log in, they will be prompted to set up 2FA for their user account by registering their Portal account with an authenticator app, such as Google Authenticator.

## Enabling 2FA in the UKCloud Portal

If you are a Portal administrator, you can enable 2FA for an account so that users must provide a 2FA code when they log in as well as their user name and password.

To enable 2FA:

1. Log in to the UKCloud Portal as an administrator.

    For more detailed instructions, see the [*Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal*](ptl-gs.md).

2. If necessary, switch to the account for which you want to change the security settings.

3. In the navigation panel, select **Settings**.
