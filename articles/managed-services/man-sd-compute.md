# Basic Managed Compute from UKCloud Service Definition

## Why UKCloud?

UKCloud is dedicated to helping the UK Public Sector and UK citizens by delivering more choice and flexibility through safe and trusted cloud technology. We own and operate a UK-sovereign, industry-leading, multi-cloud platform, located within the Government’s Crown Campus, offering multiple cloud technologies, including VMware, Azure, OpenStack, OpenShift and Oracle. This enables customers to choose the right technology for creating new workloads or migrating existing applications to the cloud.

We recognise the importance of government services in making the country run smoothly, which is why we include the highest level of support to all our customers at no extra cost. This includes a dedicated 24/7 UK telephone and ticket support, and Network Operations Centre (NOC) utilising protective and proactive monitoring tools, and access to UKCloud’s technical experts.

## What is Basic Managed Compute from UKCloud?

Basic Managed Compute from UKCloud offers routine operating system (OS) management for compute instances deployed within UKCloud’s multi-cloud. It helps you accelerate value from our platform by removing the burden of basic operational tasks, letting you focus on the stack above the operating system.

The service offers provisioning and management of Windows and Linux operating systems and is intentionally simple and consistent with our ethos of automation. For a higher level of management, we have over 240 partners offering a wide range of comprehensive managed solutions and services.

Note that this service is in addition to the provision and cost of any IaaS compute charges.

For full information regarding this product, we have Service Scopes, FAQs and other relevant documents on our [Knowledge Centre](https://docs.ukcloud.com).

## What the service can help you achieve

- Reduce operational tasks

- Reduce effort on tasks such as compute deployment, configuration, patching and rebooting

- Concentrate on creating and managing applications and solutions

- Automate backups and restores

## Product options

The service is designed to be flexible and allows you to choose from the options below to match your requirements.

The service is available for a number of operating systems and provides the following technical features:

- Initial deployment of standardised Windows and Linux OS from a UKCloud image

- Initial configuration of common OS parameters, such as IP address and disk volumes

- Fixed (pre-determined) disk and volume configuration as set by the customer

- Provision of critical core OS security patches

- Provision and maintenance of an antivirus solution

- Rebooting of a non-responding OS

- Backup and recovery of entire images

- Provision of Microsoft Server or RHEL licences if applicable

No extended troubleshooting or remediation is offered. For a faster time to recovery, we offer the following recovery options in the event of a recurring or prolonged error condition:

- Reverting a compute instance to a backup or snapshot (last known good configuration)

- Redeployment of an OS from a standard OS image (application and data would need to be reloaded by the customer)

- Recovery of a compute instance from a known good backup

For further details of each of these options, see the accompanying service scope document.

### Backup and restore

Backup and restoration services are dependent upon the backup and recovery component of the chosen cloud technology, for example Snapshot or Journaling Protection on VMware, TrilioVault on OpenStack, or our Multi-Cloud Backup service for other in-cloud or on-premises technologies.

For full details of each of these options, see the relevant service scope document. Additional charges for backup technologies and storage charges may apply.

### Disaster recovery

Disaster recovery (DR) capabilities are dependent on the chosen cloud technology, for example Journaling Protection on VMware, TrilioVault on OpenStack or Azure Site Recovery for Azure Stack.

For full details of each of these options, see the relevant service scope document.

Additional charges for these DR capabilities may apply.
