# Managed Monitoring from UKCloud FAQs

## Service

### What is the service?

As customer solutions start to expand beyond their own data centres into embracing the benefits of leveraging multi-cloud, accurate and trusted monitoring of the various technology stacks and locations become highly complex and resource intensive. Managed Monitoring from UKCloud helps to reduce these challenges, whilst increasing your level of trust and confidence of the true health of your entire IT estate, from IoT edge devices, through to any infrastructure, be it virtual or physical.

With Managed Monitoring from UKCloud, we become your first line of support, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, in receiving and reacting to any abnormal events or alerts across your IT estate, reducing the amount of noise customers traditionally must filter through, enabling them to focus on the critical events that really matter.

### What technologies do you use?

UKCloud uses the same technologies we use in house to monitor events across our public clouds to deliver our Managed Monitoring service, providing you with the confidence that well proven and understood technologies are being used to underpin this service.

This service also leverages the benefits of AIOps (see below).

### What is AIOps?

The term *AIOps* stands for *artificial intelligence for IT operations*. AIOps platforms utilise big data, modern machine learning and other advanced analytics technologies to directly and indirectly enhance IT operations (monitoring, automation and service desk) functions with proactive, personal and dynamic insight. AIOps platforms enable the concurrent use of multiple data sources, data collection methods, analytical (real-time and deep) technologies, and presentation technologies. 

### Do I get access to a dashboard or reports?

As it is assumed UKCloud will manage all monitoring aspects as part of this service, there is currently no dashboard or reporting features for customers to access.

### How do I get alerted on events?

All alerting will be performed via a support ticket or any special escalation process agreed between UKCloud and the customer.

### How does UKCloud provide urgent maintenance notifications and incident reports?

Current Service Status reports are published on the [Status Page](https://status.ukcloud.com/). You can view past incident reports on the UKCloud Portal.

## Management

### How do I access my monitoring environment?

As it is assumed UKCloud will manage all monitoring aspects as part of this service, there is currently no environment for customers to access.

### How do I manage my services?

Currently there is no way for a customer to directly manage this service as it is assumed UKCloud will manage all monitoring aspects as part of this service. Any changes to your monitoring service can be made by raising a ticket within the [My Calls](https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/support/ivanti) section of the Portal. Alternatively, you can contact support by phone or email.

### What reports can I get about performance?

UKCloud does not currently provide instance performance reports, but you can monitor instance performance using standard tools within the operating system.

### Does UKCloud patch the service?

No, you are responsible for the patching of your services. We make a patch repository available to you for instances on the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform (which cannot connect to the internet) for common operating systems that we provide.

## Support

### How do I raise a support ticket?

The secure online [UKCloud Portal](https://portal.ukcloud.com/login) provides most common service management functionality. You can raise tickets within the [My Calls](https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/support/ivanti) section of the Portal. Alternatively, you can contact support by phone or email.

### What are your service maintenance windows?

As far as possible, planned maintenance of UKCloud's infrastructure takes place periodically and at a time that aims to minimise customer impact. We provide customers with at least 14 days' advance notice of planned maintenance.

As far as possible, emergency maintenance of UKCloud's infrastructure takes place between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Friday, or between the hours of 08:00 and 12:00 (UK local time) on Saturday or Sunday, unless there is an identified and demonstrable immediate risk to a customer's environment. Whenever possible, we provide customers with at least six hours' advance notice of emergency maintenance.

### Can I configure email alerts from the Portal?

Yes, you can have Portal notifications sent to you at the email address associated with your Portal login. Notifications provide information about updates to UKCloud services, in addition to maintenance and incident notifications.

## Onboarding

### How can I get started with the service?

Within 5 business days of accepting an order, UKCloud will create the customer's monitoring environment with default thresholds (unless otherwise specified) and commence monitoring any environments that have been elected by the customer to be monitored.

### Is there a free trial?

Due to the initial complexity of creating the monitoring environment, UKCloud is currently unable to offer a free trial of this service.

## Backup

### Does UKCloud back up the Managed Monitoring from UKCloud service?

UKCloud will perform a nightly backup of the configuration of any thresholds or triggers defined as part of this service. All event data is eventually stored within UKCloud's highly resilient centralised monitoring data lake.

## Billing and legal

### What is the smallest unit of time I will be billed for?

The minimum unit of time for use is monthly. Part months will be rounded up.

### Will I be charged for resources in a 'Shut Off' state?

UKCloud will continue to charge for any resources that you have elected to be monitored regardless of the state they're in. In order to stop any charges, you'll need to raise a ticket within the [My Calls](https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/support/ivanti) section of the Portal. Alternatively, you can contact support by phone or email.

### How can I view billing information?

Online visibility of real-time or historic billing information is currently not available as a service provided by UKCloud.

### How can I pay for the services?

Payment for UKCloud services can be made by direct bank transfer (BACS/CHAPS). You can find bank details for payment on your invoice.

If you signed up with a credit or debit card, your payment card will be automatically charged no sooner than seven (7) days after the invoice date.

### What are the termination fees?

There are no termination costs for this service.

## Security

### How is my monitoring data kept secure?

UKCloud will deploy and manage all collectors used to monitor customer events, with all traffic being passed via HTTPS.

The data that UKCloud collects as part of this service will never leave a UKCloud data centre or be shared with a third party.

### Is there a protective monitoring service?

Protective monitoring is included with all our IaaS platforms and follows GPGÂ 13.
