# Managed Monitoring from UKCloud Service Definition

## Why UKCloud?

UKCloud is dedicated to helping the UK Public Sector and UK citizens by delivering more choice and flexibility through safe and trusted cloud technology. We own and operate a UK-sovereign, industry-leading, multi-cloud platform, located within the Government’s Crown Campus, offering multiple cloud technologies, including VMware, Azure, OpenStack, OpenShift and Oracle. This enables customers to choose the right technology for creating new workloads or migrating existing applications to the cloud.

We recognise the importance of government services in making the country run smoothly, which is why we include the highest level of support to all our customers at no extra cost. This includes a dedicated 24/7 UK telephone and ticket support, and Network Operations Centre (NOC) utilising protective and proactive monitoring tools, and access to UKCloud’s technical experts.

## What is Managed Monitoring from UKCloud?

As customer solutions start to expand beyond their own data centres into embracing the benefits of leveraging multi-cloud, accurate and trusted monitoring of the various technology stacks and locations become highly complex and resource intensive. Managed Monitoring from UKCloud helps to reduce these challenges, whilst increasing your level of trust and confidence of the true health of your entire IT estate, from IoT edge devices, through to any infrastructure, be it virtual or physical.

With Managed Monitoring from UKCloud, we become your first line of support, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, in receiving and reacting to any abnormal events or alerts across your IT estate, reducing the amount of noise customers traditional must filter through, allowing them to focus on the critical events that really matter.

For full information regarding this product, we have Service Scopes, FAQs and other relevant documents on our [Knowledge Centre](https://docs.ukcloud.com).

## What the service can help you achieve

- Incorporate, consolidate and extend your current monitoring platforms and any new requirements in to a single, as a service, solution

- Gain a reliable and trusted view of the health of your entire IT infrastructure

- Monitor any device from anywhere, via the internet or various community networks UKCloud supports

- Concentrate on creating and managing applications and increasing business value rather than managing virtual infrastructure

- Reduce the number of ‘false-positive’ alerts and associated out of hours call-outs. Utilise UKCloud’s 24x7x365 Network Operations Centre to be the initial responder to events, only escalating those which genuinely need further investigation

- Increase the uptime of your IT estate through faster identification, triage and alert escalations

- Leverage the insights that UKCloud’s AIOps platform can provide in identifying trends and anomalies

- Hook into virtual resource metrics (CPU, disk, memory) and highlight performance trends, helping you to right-size your resources to meet the requirements of your applications

- Network performance and availability monitoring

- Application Performance Monitoring (APM) – the ability to monitor your application performance through the eyes of you users rather than the traditional ‘infrastructure up’ perspective

- Allow UKCloud to execute defined ‘playbook’, enabling UKCloud to proactively perform basic actions such as service restarts and log file rotations, in response to pre-defined events
