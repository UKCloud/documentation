# S3-compatible API examples for Cloud Storage

These examples show common operations in different languages, including Ruby and Python.

**ECS examples:**

This project contains sample code for common operations against UKCloud's ECS based Cloud Storage service. Whilst ECS itself supports both an S3 compatible and an EMC native API the samples in this repository are designed to work with the S3 compatible endpoint only.

You can find the examples in our GitHub repository here: <https://github.com/UKCloud/ecs-s3-examples>
