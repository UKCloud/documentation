# How to install CIFS-ECS

## What is CIFS-ECS?

CIFS-ECS is a free application that runs on Windows and Windows Server, exposing UKCloud Cloud Storage as file systems. It’s designed as an easy way to use object storage by enabling Windows applications to interface with Cloud Storage servers using the popular S3 REST API.

## Use cases

You can use CIFS-ECS to:

- Expose UKCloud Cloud Storage for native access on Windows through a centralised server With CIFS-ECS installed on a centralised Windows Server installation.

- Present Cloud Storage as storage for applications, without additional development.

- Use Cloud Storage as a target for backups or long-term file retention.

## Before you begin

CIFS-ECS offers a single caching option:

**Stub**: files are initially stored locally and replaced with a stub, or shortcut, after a period of time. When you access a file that has been stubbed, it will be retrieved from the cloud. This offers the best scalability, as you can use a virtually unlimited amount of cloud storage.

## Installing CIFS-ECS

1. Navigate to the following Portal page to download the ZIP file that contains the CIFS-ECS installer: [CIFS-ECS Tool](https://portal.ukcloud.com/support/knowledge_centre/85dc54ff-7d21-43ac-9cfa-88e87de7ba27).

    To download CIFS-ECS you'll need your UKCloud Portal log in details.

2. Extract and run the setup launcher from the ZIP file.

3. Step through the wizard, adjusting values to suit your environment.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The Data Directory is used as a local cache for any content you place in the CIFS-ECS drive, so you may want to put this on a non-system volume.

4. When the installation is complete, click **Add CIFS-ECS Drive** to open the *Drive Parameters* page.

5. On the *Drive Parameters* page, select any available drive letter from the drop down menu to use as the CIFS-ECS drive then click **Next**.

    Optional: give your ECS drive a description.
