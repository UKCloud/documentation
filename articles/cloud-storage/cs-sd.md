# Cloud Storage Service Definition

## Why UKCloud?

UKCloud is dedicated to helping the UK Public Sector and UK citizens by delivering more choice and flexibility through safe and trusted cloud technology. We own and operate a UK-sovereign, industry-leading, multi-cloud platform, located within the Government’s Crown Campus, offering multiple cloud technologies, including VMware, Azure, OpenStack, OpenShift and Oracle. This enables customers to choose the right technology for creating new workloads or migrating existing applications to the cloud.

We recognise the importance of government services in making the country run smoothly, which is why we include the highest level of support to all our customers at no extra cost. This includes a dedicated 24/7 UK telephone and ticket support, and Network Operations Centre (NOC) utilising protective and proactive monitoring tools, and access to UKCloud’s technical experts.

## What is Cloud Storage?

Cloud Storage from UKCloud is a secure and highly adaptable storage platform designed to address a wide variety of use cases. It's based on object storage technology which is natively optimised for cloud storage in terms of scale, resilience and accessibility. Traditional storage solutions are typically characterised by large capital expenditure and an intensive management and support burden, and forever swing between under and over capacity. Cloud Storage benefits customers as there are no upfront costs and no minimum term commitments — customers merely pay for what they actually use, when they use it.

For full information regarding this product, we have [Service Scopes](cs-sco.md), [FAQs](cs-faq.md) and other relevant documents on our [Knowledge Centre](https://docs.ukcloud.com).

## What the service can help you achieve
