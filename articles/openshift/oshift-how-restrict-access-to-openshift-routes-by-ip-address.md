# How to restrict access to OpenShift routes by IP address

## Overview

This knowledge centre article explains how OpenShift developers can restrict access to the routes they create to their deployed services in OpenShift by IP address. Restricting access in this way increases the security of a route by allowing only trusted IPs to access the OpenShift route.

### Intended audience

OpenShift developers who have created and deployed services into OpenShift, and created and exposed routes for those services. This article describes how to further secure access to those exposed routes by allowing only trusted IPs to access them.

## Restricting access to a route

After creating and exposing a route in OpenShift in the usual manner, you can then add an annotation to the route specifying the IP address(es) that you would like to whitelist.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Whitelisting a IP address automatically blacklists everything else.
  
You apply the annotation to a route in the following manner:
  
    oc annotate route <route_name> haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist=<ip_address>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must do this for every route that you wish to apply the whitelisting to.

## Examples

To allow a single IP address through to the route, use the following:
  
    oc annotate route <route_name> haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist=192.168.1.10

To allow several IP addresses through to the route, separate each IP with a space:

    oc annotate route <route_name> haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist=192.168.1.10 192.168.1.11 192.168.1.12

To allow a network CIDR through to the route, declare the network CIDR as so:

    oc annotate route <route_name> haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist=192.168.1.10/24

You can even use a mix of IP addresses and a network CIDR:

    oc annotate route <route_name> haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist=192.168.1.10 180.5.61.153 192.168.1.0/24 10.0.0.0/8

To delete the IPs from the annotation, you can run the command:
    
    oc annotate route <route_name> haproxy.router.openshift.io/ip_whitelist-

> This functionality is available by default in UKCloud OpenShift deployments of version 3.10 or newer. For all previous versions customers need to raise a request with UKCloud to have this functionality enabled.
