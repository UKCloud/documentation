# Security best practices for UKCloud for OpenShift

## Overview

As is the nature of technology, any cloud-based service is vulnerable to exploits from both hackers and insiders just the same as traditional environments. Such risks include data stealing, crypto-mining, ransomware and service disruption to name a few. Although the nature of running container-based workloads reduces the threat to your underlying infrastructure, that threat is not completely eliminated and you should still take care when designing, developing and deploying your container-based workloads to minimise the risks to those deployments in UKCloud for OpenShift.

This article sets out some best practices to follow to minimise the attack vector to a UKCloud for OpenShift cluster and its workloads.

### Intended audience

This article is intended for anyone who is using UKCloud for OpenShift. It highlights some of the best practices to keep OpenShift workloads secure.

## Role Based Access Control

Within OpenShift, you can grant various levels of access to users, which can be cluster-wide or limited to a particular OpenShift object. You can associate users and groups with multiple roles at the same time.

You can view a pre-defined list of cluster roles and local roles [here](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#roles).

 - Users with the cluster-admin default cluster role bound cluster-wide can perform any action on any resource.

 - Users with the admin default cluster role bound locally can manage roles and bindings within a project.

It is good practice to follow the [Principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) with OpenShift access. For information about creating new OpenShift users, see [*How to create new UKCloud for OpenShift users in the UKCloud Portal*](oshift-how-create-users.md). This article also explains how to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) when logging in to OpenShift. Users are also encouraged to change their passwords regularly, which is possible to do from the UKCloud Portal. You should ensure that OpenShift account credentials are not shared between multiple users. Instead, you should create individual user accounts for each user with the correct role binding. It is also the responsibility of each individual user to ensure the physical security of the terminal from which they access OpenShift.

Users should also apply Principle of least privilege to there containers work loads, this means to run your workloads as a user with just enough permissions to run the workload within your containers. Particularly avoiding running privileged containers if this can be avoided. If however a workload does require to be run privileged container than users need to ensure that they set the correct security context constraint to run that container. You can read more about setting the correct SCC [here](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/admin_guide/manage_scc.html). Containers that try to run as priviledged without the relevant SCC set will fail to run.

## Service accounts

You should use service accounts for all API access, which should be accomplished by an automated process; never use a regular user's credentials. Usually a service account's username is the same as the project it is created for, followed by its name:

```
system:serviceaccount:<project>:<name>. 
```

For example:

```
system:serviceaccount:continuous-integration:jenkins
```

You can read more about service accounts [here](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/dev_guide/service_accounts.html).

## Creating and deploying vulnerable container images

Just like traditional software packages, containers also run software, even if they are running that software within a self contained environment of a container. These containers can be built and run using vulnerable software packages/libraries. It is therefore considered good practice to do the following to ensure that you are not introducing vulnerable containers into your clusters.

 1. Only use base images from trusted sources, i.e Red Hat's container registry. RedHats containers on RedHats container registry are scanned for vulnerabilities and given a security rating. Docker Hub also provides some certified containers which are built using best practices, tested and validated against the Docker Enterprise Edition platform and APIs, pass Dockers security requirements, and are collaboratively supported by Docker and the firms whos container it is. Users can also choose to build base containers from scratch using only the software packages they need for their workload. Although building containers from scratch and using just enough of the software packages you need to run for your workload does not garantee that your base image is going to be free of all possible vulnerabilities as it is possible that some of those software packages could contain vulnerabilities.

 2. Scan your containers with container scanning software as part of your build or deployment process. There are several tools available to scan containers. These tools give you a security rating on your final container once it's been created from a secure base container. There are a few such tools:- 

  -  OpenSCAP-docker
  -  Black Duck Hub
  -  JFrog Xray
  -  Twistlock
  -  Image-inspector
  -  Clair
 
## Secrets

Sensitive information, such as passwords, SSH keys, tokens and certificates, are examples of information that could be considered secret. As such secrets should never be stored in any place in plain text readable format (for example, in source code, GitHub repositories, and so on). It is imperative that when secrets are required in OpenShift, they are set up as OpenShift Secrets. This allows the secrets to be encrypted within OpenShift and accessed only by the relevant containers when they are needed. However there are limits to the current OpenShift secrets ability, these are; that the secrets are encoded in base64 encryption which can be easily decrypted and stored secrets can be accessible from any container on the same node. So users could use a popular solution like Hashicorps Vault software for secret storage. 

## Limiting resources

You should always set up containers with resource limits. In the event of a denial of service attack, or even just a burst of very high load on a service, these resource limits will prevent pods from using all available resources in the node they are running on. You can read more about setting resource quotas and limits [here](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/dev_guide/compute_resources.html).

## Route security

Within OpenShift, you can expose your services using routes. Creating a route to a service enables your users to access the service through a URL in a browser. If you do not specify any SSL certificates for your route than it would be exposed on HTTP port 80 without any SSL certificate. You can secure these routes with SSL encryption using one of three SSL termination methods:

 - Edge - SSL termination is done on the HAProxy router from which point onwards the traffic is un-encrypted

 - Passthrough termination - There is no SSL decryption on the routers; instead connections are passed straight through the routers to the OpenShift applications, which are then responsible for SSL certificate termination and traffic decryption.

 - Re-Encrypt - This process uses two certificates: the first certificate is held on the HAProxy router and the second in the pods. This secures traffic all the way down to the application.

# Security Groups

UKCloud can secure routes with the use of Security Groups applied by the UKCloud OpenShift team, these security groups can be applied at the time of cluster deployment or later via a Service Request to the UKCloud OpenShift Support team. These security groups can also be used to secure routes which are exposed to various Government Community Networks. When services are protected by security groups the traffic is dropped before it reaches OpenShift.

# White Listing

You can secure your routes by applying white lists by IP address. The advantage of doing this is that users can do this themselves, however this does allow traffic to reach the OpenShift route before it is either allowed through or dropped based on the white listing users may have applied. We have documented the process of IP whitelisting [here](oshift-how-restrict-access-to-openshift-routes-by-ip-address.md). 


## Network Isolation

OpenShift uses a software-defined networking (SDN) approach to provide cluster-wide networking that enables communication between pods across the OpenShift cluster. This Container Networking Interface (CNI) runs in the OpenShift SDN project and creates an overlay network using the Open vSwitch (OVS) SDN plugin. OVS has 3 different plugins based on the type of pod network cluster admins would like to create. Previoudly UKCloud were using the ovs-multitenant SDN plugin, as of February 2019 and OpenShift 3.11 UKCloud have been deploying OpenShift clusters using the ovs-network-policy SDN plugin. This plugin allows project administrators to configure their own network isolation policies using [NetworkPolicy objects](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/admin_guide/managing_networking.html#admin-guide-networking-networkpolicy). UKCloud have documented the process of using Network Policy based isolation [here](oshift-how-use-netpol.md).
