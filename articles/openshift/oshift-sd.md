# UKCloud for Managed OpenShift Service Definition

## What is UKCloud for Managed OpenShift?

UKCloud for Managed OpenShift provides a secure, private deployment of Red Hat's OpenShift Container Platform. The service is delivered as a managed platform, enabling developers to build automation pipelines and leverage the benefits of containerised solutions, helping to deliver modern, cloud-native applications and accelerate digital transformation.

UKCloud deploys, scales, monitors and updates the platform, freeing up your DevOps resources to focus on adding value further up the stack through the rapid delivery of quality controlled code, all without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure or platform services.

## What the service can help you achieve

- Deliver new software features faster, focusing on customer value rather than infrastructure complexities

- Cope with unpredictable spikes in traffic and customer demand

- Realise more value from your DevOps team by enabling them to focus on the 'Dev' rather than 'Ops'

- Create a standard approach to deployment, ensuring consistency across all users

- Perform platform maintenance with less disruption to applications

- Try out new ideas in a low-risk sandboxed environment

- Remove the cost and complexity of provisioning, managing and scaling the underlying infrastructure, OS and middleware components

- Avoid lock-in – OpenShift can be deployed on a wide choice of IaaS platforms

## Product options

The service enables you to select from a number of configuration options including choice of security domain, network connectivity and flavours of nodes in the cluster.
