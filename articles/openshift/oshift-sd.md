# UKCloud for OpenShift Service Definition

## Why UKCloud?

UKCloud is dedicated to helping the UK Public Sector and UK citizens by delivering more choice and flexibility through safe and trusted cloud technology. We own and operate a UK-sovereign, industry-leading, multi-cloud platform, located within the Government’s Crown Campus, offering multiple cloud technologies, including VMware, Azure, OpenStack, OpenShift and Oracle. This enables customers to choose the right technology for creating new workloads or migrating existing applications to the cloud.

We recognise the importance of government services in making the country run smoothly, which is why we include the highest level of support to all our customers at no extra cost. This includes a dedicated 24/7 UK telephone and ticket support, and Network Operations Centre (NOC) utilising protective and proactive monitoring tools, and access to UKCloud’s technical experts.

## What is UKCloud for OpenShift?

UKCloud for OpenShift delivers a secure, private deployment of Red Hat’s OpenShift Container Platform, enabling developers to use build automation pipelines and leverage the benefits of containerised solutions, helping to deliver modern, cloud native applications and accelerate digital transformation.

UKCloud deploys, scales and monitors the platform, freeing up your DevOps resources to focus on adding value further up the stack through the rapid delivery of quality-controlled code, all without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure or software.

For full information regarding this product, we have [FAQs](oshift-faq.md) and other relevant documents on our [Knowledge Centre](https://docs.ukcloud.com).

## What the service can help you achieve

- Deliver new software features faster, focusing on customer value rather than infrastructure complexities

- Cope with unpredictable spikes in traffic and customer demand

- Realise more value from your DevOps team by allowing them to focus on the ‘Dev’ rather than ‘Ops’

- Create a standard approach to deployment, ensuring consistency across all users

- Perform platform maintenance with less disruption to applications

- Try out new ideas in a low-risk sandboxed environment

- Remove the cost and complexity of provisioning, managing and scaling the underlying infrastructure, OS and middleware components

- Avoid lock-in — OpenShift can be deployed on a wide choice of IaaS platforms

## Product options

The service is designed to be flexible and allows you to mix and match from a range of pre-defined Runtime Packs and change them when required.

### Security Domain Foundation Pack

Choose the security domain to deploy the foundation for supporting the orchestration and management of the container runtime environments.

- Assured OFFICIAL - DDoS-protected internet, PSN, HSCN and Janet

- Elevated OFFICIAL - PSN and RLI

### Runtime Packs

Provides the footprint to host customer's containerised applications and services. (Customers can choose to mix and match Runtime Packs)

- SMALL (16 GiB / 2vCPU)

- MEDIUM (32 GiB / 4vCPU)

- LARGE (64 GiB / 8vCPU)

### Persistent Volumes

Containers in OpenShift by default don’t persist data. Every time an application is started, it creates a new container with an immutable image. Hence, any persisted data in the file system is lost when the container stops or is destroyed. Persistent Volumes can be used within your OpenShift environment to provide data persistence independent of containers.

- Tier 1 - High I/O database applications

- Tier 2 - Seldom-accessed media

### Registry Storage

OpenShift builds images directly from your source code, utilising an integrated registry to locally manage images. This registry is stored securely outside of your OpenShift environment

- UKCloud provides you with an initial 60GB of registry storage as part of your Foundation Pack; any additional registry storage will be chargable.

### Additional Networks

By default, your OpenShift cluster will only be connected to the internet. Your OpenShift environment can be provisioned on other networks such as HSCN, Janet, RLI and PSN

### Infrastructure Nodes

Additional nodes to support OpenShift core services such as OpenShift routers, registry, metric collection and aggregated logging. Infrastructure nodes cannot be used for containerised workloads.

## Pricing and packaging

UKCloud for Red Hat OpenShift starts from £940 per month, and full pricing with all options including licensing and connectivity available in the [*UKCloud Pricing Guide*](https://ukcloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ukcloud-pricing-guide-11.0.pdf).
