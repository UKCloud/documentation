# How to customise the OpenShift router error page

## Overview

UKCloud for OpenShift enables you to develop, deploy, and manage digital and container-based applications seamlessly across local physical or virtual environments, with full portability to and from UKCloud.

This article explains how you can edit the *Application Not Available* (503 error) page, which is returned to users by OpenShift routers when an application is unavailable or when an invalid route is accessed.

### Intended audience

This article assumes familiarity with the Linux command line, and with the `oc` command set to manage an OpenShift cluster.

### Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this article, you must have the `oc` command installed and have a suitable account on your OpenShift cluster. Specifically, it is assumed you know the authentication credentials that need to be supplied to `oc login`. Your account must have access to edit objects in the "default" project. 

Your OpenShift cluster must be version 3.x.

## Editing the Application Not Available page

1. On your client PC, create a file called `error-page-503.http` containing the HTML required for the custom error page with the following headers at the top of the file:

    ```html
    HTTP/1.0 503 Service Unavailable
    Pragma: no-cache
    Cache-Control: private, max-age=0, no-cache, no-store
    Connection: close
    Content-Type: text/html
    
    <html>
    <head>
    ...
    ```

2. Create a configmap to pass this file into the router pods:

    ```none
    $ oc project default
    $ oc create configmap haproxy-custom-configs --from-file=error-page-503.http
    ```
       
3. Attach the configmap as a volume to the router deployment config:

    ```none
    $ oc set volume dc/router --add --name custom-configs -t configmap --configmap-name=haproxy-custom-configs -m /var/lib/haproxy/conf/error-page-503.http --sub-path=error-page-503.http
    ````
       
5. If your cluster is multi-network (connected to HSCN, VRF, and so on), you may want to repeat this for the router-private configmap so that the private network routers also serve the custom page:      

    ```none
    $ oc set volume dc/router-private --add --name custom-configs -t configmap --configmap-name=haproxy-custom-configs -m /var/lib/haproxy/conf/error-page-503.http --sub-path=error-page-503.http
    ```
	   
## Reverting to the default Application Not Available page

To revert the above changes and return to the default error page, run the following:

```none
$ oc set volume dc/router --remove --name custom-configs 
$ oc set volume dc/router-private --remove --name custom-configs # (if router-private was edited)
$ oc delete configmap haproxy-custom-configs
```
