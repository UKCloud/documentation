# Private Cloud for Oracle Software Service Definition

## Why UKCloud?

UKCloud is dedicated to helping the UK Public Sector and UK citizens by delivering more choice and flexibility through safe and trusted cloud technology. We own and operate a UK-sovereign, industry-leading, multi-cloud platform, located within the Government’s Crown Campus, offering multiple cloud technologies, including VMware, Azure, OpenStack, OpenShift and Oracle. This enables customers to choose the right technology for creating new workloads or migrating existing applications to the cloud.

We recognise the importance of government services in making the country run smoothly, which is why we include the highest level of support to all our customers at no extra cost. This includes a dedicated 24/7 UK telephone and ticket support, and Network Operations Centre (NOC) utilising protective and proactive monitoring tools, and access to UKCloud’s technical experts.

## What is Private Cloud for Oracle Software?

Private Cloud for Oracle Software enables you to have private implementations of Oracle’s Engineered Systems within UKCloud’s assured, sovereign datacentres, Crown Hosting Data Centres or even on-premise. It enables you to have a tailored Oracle environment specifically for the high performance or big data analytical platforms that are proprietary to Oracle, whilst connecting to workloads that you have within the rest of our multi-cloud ecosystem, including UKCloud for Oracle Software – a multi-tenant cloud option for Oracle VMs.

For full information regarding this product, we have [Service Scopes](prc-sco-orcl.md) and other relevant documents on our [Knowledge Centre](https://docs.ukcloud.com).
