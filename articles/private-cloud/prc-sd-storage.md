# Private Cloud for Storage Service Definition

## Why UKCloud?

UKCloud is dedicated to helping the UK Public Sector and UK citizens by delivering more choice and flexibility through safe and trusted cloud technology. We own and operate a UK-sovereign, industry-leading, multi-cloud platform, located within the Government’s Crown Campus, offering multiple cloud technologies, including VMware, Azure, OpenStack, OpenShift and Oracle. This enables customers to choose the right technology for creating new workloads or migrating existing applications to the cloud.

We recognise the importance of government services in making the country run smoothly, which is why we include the highest level of support to all our customers at no extra cost. This includes a dedicated 24/7 UK telephone and ticket support, and Network Operations Centre (NOC) utilising protective and proactive monitoring tools, and access to UKCloud’s technical experts.

## What is Private Cloud for Storage?

Our Private Cloud for Storage provides single-tenant storage Infrastructure as a Service. Your data is hosted in one of our UK data centres, to gain the benefits of our mature and proven Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL security domains; or within the Government’s Crown Campus.

Private Cloud for Storage is designed to be deployed as part of a larger solution to include genuine multi-cloud services such as UKCloud for VMware and UKCloud for OpenStack. This enables you to leverage the benefits of the UKCloud platform; even on infrastructure that is entirely dedicated to your organisation.

For full information regarding this product, we have [Service Scopes](prc-sco-storage.md), [FAQs](prc-faq-storage.md) and other relevant documents on our [Knowledge Centre](https://docs.ukcloud.com).
