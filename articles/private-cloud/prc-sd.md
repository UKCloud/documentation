# Private Cloud Service Definition

## What is Private Cloud?

A Private Cloud delivered by UKCloud is a high-assurance, cost-effective alternative to hosting and managing your own compute and storage infrastructure. This secure single-tenant cloud platform provides you with physical hardware separation and isolation from other customers. This enables you to meet heightened security requirements and provides increased flexibility over the infrastructure enabling you to specify host and storage requirements, with options to include high performance GPU, advanced monitoring and disaster recovery capability.

Offered on a choice of technology stacks, including VMware, Microsoft Azure Stack, Oracle Virtual Machine, Oracle Cloud at Customer or Red Hat OpenStack implementations. We can deploy a Private Cloud in either of our UK data centres to gain the benefits of our Assured and Elevated security domains, within the Crown Campus or within your own data centre.

## What the service can help you achieve

- **Modernisation of workloads.** Move your applications to a modern cloud platform, to your own timeframe, without compromising existing services.

- **Increased security and compliance.** Gain the advantages of cloud, while retaining regulatory compliance through physical separation.

- **Deployment of secure disconnected environments.** Provide connectivity via private and secure network links, rather than over the public internet.

- **Utilise existing skills.** Private Cloud supports familiar technology stacks (VMware, Azure Stack, OpenStack, Oracle).

- **Integration of existing software.** Integrate software that requires access to the underlying hypervisor, including AV and backup solutions.

- **Resolves migration challenges.** Keep full control over configuration, simplifying migration from a legacy on-premises environment.

## Pricing and packaging

Private Cloud pricing can be as low as £150 per VM per month. Full pricing with all options is available in the [UKCloud Pricing Guide](https://ukcloud.com/pricing-guide).

## Accreditation and information assurance

The security of our platform is our number one priority. We've always been committed to adhering to exacting standards, frameworks and best practice. Everything we do is subject to regular independent validation by government accreditors, sector auditors and management system assessors. Details are available on the [UKCloud website](https://ukcloud.com/governance/).

## Connectivity options

UKCloud provides one of the best-connected cloud platforms for the UK Public Sector. We enable access to our secure platform by DDoS-protected internet, PSN, Janet, HSCN, RLI and your own leased lines via our HybridConnect or CrownConnect services. The full range of flexible connectivity options is detailed in the [UKCloud Pricing Guide](https://ukcloud.com/pricing-guide).

## An SLA you can trust

We understand that enterprise workloads need a dependable service that underpins the reliability of the application to users and other systems, which is why we offer one of the best SLAs on G-Cloud. For full details on the service SLA, including measurements and service credits, see the [*SLA definition*](../other/other-ref-sla-definition.md).

## The small print

Private Cloud operates a minimum commitment of either three or 24 months, depending on the pricing and packaging option chosen. Early exit charges apply if you exit this service whilst still within the minimum commitment term. If you exit the service within the minimum commit then UKCloud will bill all the remaining committed term's fees and asset costs within the final invoice.

For full terms and conditions, including onboarding and responsibilities, refer to the [*Terms and conditions documents*](../other/other-ref-terms-and-conditions.md).

For more information about this service, see the [*Service Scope*](prc-sco.md) and [*FAQs*](prc-faq.md).

## Why UKCloud?

UKCloud is dedicated to the digital transformation of our nation's public services through our flexible, secure and cost-effective multi-cloud platform and the expertise of our people and partners. We believe that diversity of technology drives value and innovation and so we bring together different cloud technologies, with different deployment models spanning on-premises (private cloud), on-campus (Government's Crown Campus) and off-campus global public cloud services. This enables you to choose the right cloud for creating new workloads or migrating or replacing existing applications to the cloud with specialist SaaS solutions.
