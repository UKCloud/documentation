# Private Cloud Service Definition

## Why UKCloud?

UKCloud is dedicated to helping the UK Public Sector and UK citizens by delivering more choice and flexibility through safe and trusted cloud technology. We own and operate a UK-sovereign, industry-leading, multi-cloud platform, located within the Government’s Crown Campus, offering multiple cloud technologies, including VMware, Azure, OpenStack, OpenShift and Oracle. This enables customers to choose the right technology for creating new workloads or migrating existing applications to the cloud.

We recognise the importance of government services in making the country run smoothly, which is why we include the highest level of support to all our customers at no extra cost. This includes a dedicated 24/7 UK telephone and ticket support, and Network Operations Centre (NOC) utilising protective and proactive monitoring tools, and access to UKCloud’s technical experts.

## What is Private Cloud?

Private Cloud is a high assurance, cost-effective alternative to hosting and managing your own compute and storage infrastructure. This secure single-tenant compute and storage platform provides you with physical hardware separation and isolation from other customers. This enables you to meet heightened security requirements and provides increased flexibility over the infrastructure allowing you to specify host and storage requirements with options to include high performance GPU, advanced monitoring and DR.

Offering a choice of technology stacks, including VMware, Microsoft Azure Stack, Oracle Virtual Machine, Oracle Cloud at Customer or Red Hat OpenStack implementations. You can deploy Private Cloud in either of our UK data centres to gain the benefits of our Assured and Elevated security domains, within the Crown Campus or within your own data centre.

For full information regarding this product, we have [Service Scopes](prc-sco.md), [FAQs](prc-faq.md) and other relevant documents on our [Knowledge Centre](https://docs.ukcloud.com).
