# UKCloud for Microsoft Azure Troubleshooting

## Overview

This guide describes some of the issues you may encounter when using UKCloud for Microsoft Azure:

- [Login results in server error](#login-results-in-server-error)

- [Azure Stack portal does not show any resources](#azure-stack-portal-does-not-show-any-resources)

- [Diagnostics do not work for Linux VMs](#diagnostics-do-not-work-for-linux-vms)

- [Virtual machine disk size is not showing in the GUI or CLI](#virtual-machine-disk-size-is-not-showing-in-the-gui-or-cli)

## Login results in server error

### Cause

When first logging in to the Azure Stack portal, you may see the following error:

`Server Error in '/' Application.`

### Solution

Refresh the page and the login should work.

## Azure Stack portal does not show any resources

### Cause

If your firewall ports are not open to enable outbound communication with Azure Stack, your Azure Stack portal will not show any resources.

### Solution

In your firewall, ensure that the appropriate ports are open for communication, as listed in *Portal (user)* row of the *Ports and protocols (inbound)* table in the following article: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-integrate-endpoints#ports-and-protocols-inbound>

## Diagnostics do not work for Linux VMs

### Cause

If you enable Microsoft Insights for your subscription (**Subscriptions > Resource providers > Microsoft.Insights** and subscribe), you'll have access to Azure Monitoring for Windows VMs only. This feature is not yet available for Linux VMs as documented at: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-update-1802>

### Solution

There is currently no workaround for this issue.

## Virtual machine disk size is not showing in the GUI or CLI

### Cause

You cannot see the virtual machine disk size in the GUI or CLI.

### Solution

To view your disk size, navigate to **Storage accounts > <storage_account_name> > Blob service > vhds** and find your disk there:
