# How to create a Service Fabric cluster using the UKCloud Azure Stack Hub portal

## Overview

Azure Stack Hub Service Fabric is a distributed systems platform that makes it easy to package, deploy, and manage scalable and reliable microservices and containers. Service Fabric also addresses the significant challenges in developing and managing cloud native applications. Developers and administrators can avoid complex infrastructure problems and focus on implementing mission-critical, demanding workloads that are scalable, reliable, and manageable. Service Fabric represents the next-generation platform for building and managing these enterprise-class, tier-1, cloud-scale applications running in containers.

The following process shows you how to setup a Service Fabric cluster using the Azure Stack Hub portal.

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this guide, you must have appropriate access to a subscription in the Azure Stack Hub portal.

## Creating a new key vault

Before creating a Service Fabric cluster, it is necessary to create a key vault to store the certificates for the cluster. These certificates are used in Service Fabric to provide authentication and encryption to secure various aspects of a cluster and its applications. You can find more information about these certificates [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-security#x509-certificates-and-service-fabric).

1. Log in to the Azure Stack Hub portal.

    For more detailed instructions, see the [*Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for Microsoft Azure*](azs-gs.md).

2. In the favourites panel, select **Create a resource**.

    ![New option in favourites panel](images/azsp_newmenu.png)

3. In the *New* blade, select **Security + Identity**.

   ![Security option in New blade](images/azs-browser-new-security.png)

4. In the *Security + Identity* blade, select **Key Vault**.

   ![New Key Vault](images/azs-browser-new-key-vault.png)

5. In the *Create key vault* blade, enter the following information:

   - **Name** - The name of the key vault.

   - **Subscription** - This is your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure subscription.

   - **Resource Group** - Select an existing resource group, or create a new one by typing a name for your new resource group.

   - **Location** - This will be `frn00006`, which is the Azure Stack Hub region.

   - **Access policies** - Configure who can access the key vault and what permissions they have.

### Adding a certificate to the key vault

1. Once the key vault has been deployed, navigate to it by clicking **All services** in the favourites panel, then selecting **Key Vaults** under the *Security* section.

2. Select your key vault from the list.

3. In the *Settings* section of the key vault blade, select **Secrets**.

4. On the *Secrets* page, click the **+ Generate/Import** button.

5. In the *Create a secret* blade, enter the following information:

   - **Upload Options** - Select the **Certificate** option.

   - **Upload Certificate** - Select the .pfx certificate to upload.

   - **Name** - The name of the certificate to identify it within the Key Vault.

6. Click **Create**.

7. Repeat as necessary, depending on how many certificates you require.

### Gathering key vault and certificate information

During configuration of the Service Fabric cluster, you must provide several details relating to the key vault and certificates. You must also configure access to the key vault for virtual machines and the Azure Resource Manager.

1. Once you have deployed the key vault, navigate to it by clicking **All services** in the favourites panel, then selecting **Key Vaults** under the *Security* section.

2. Select your key vault from the list.

3. In the *Settings* section of the key vault's blade, select **Access policies**.

4. On the *Access policies* page, click **Click to show advanced access policies**.

5. Tick the top two check boxes, then click the **Save** button.

6. In the *Settings* section of the key vault blade, select **Properties**.

7. Copy the **Resource ID** and store it for later use.

8. Select **Secrets**.

9. On the *Secrets* page, select the certificate you added in the previous section.

10. On the certificate's blade, select the current version.

11. Copy the **Secret Identifier**.

12. Repeat for each certificate that you are going to use for the Service Fabric cluster.

You also need the thumbprint of the certificate(s). For information about how to find this information, see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-retrieve-the-thumbprint-of-a-certificate).

## Create a Service Fabric cluster

1. In the favourites panel, select **Create a resource**.

   ![New option in favourites panel](images/azsp_newmenu.png)

2. In the search bar, search for **Service Fabric Cluster**.

   ![Compute option in New blade](images/azsp_computeblade.png)

3. Select **Service Fabric Cluster** and click **Create**.

4. In the **Basics** blade, enter the following information and click **OK**:

   - **Service Fabric Cluster Name** - The name of your cluster.

   - **Node Type Prefix** - Prefix for the name of each node (VM).

   - **Primary Node Type Size** - Size of the VM scale set for the primary node type.

   - **Additional Node Type Sizes** - For every additional node type, add an array with a count of the nodes in each node type. For example, if you want two additional node types with three nodes in each, enter `3,3` (separating the amount of nodes for each node type with a comma).

   - **Admin Username** - The admin username for each node.

   - **Password** - The admin password for each node.

   - **DNS Service** - Select **Yes** to use DNS service, which is an optional system service that enables you to map DNS names to a service name and discover other services using the DNS protocol. If you have applications with existing URLs that you intend to use with Service Fabric, DNS service will help you use the standard DNS protocol (as an alternative to the Service Fabric Naming service) for resolving service names.

   - **Repair Manager** - Select **Yes** to use Repair Manager to enable patch orchestration on node types with a durability of bronze, which helps keep your VMs up to date.

   - **Service Fabric deployment package URL** - Specify the URL to download the Service Fabric deployment package from. For off-line scenarios, download the service fabric package from the URL specified and upload it to a blob and enable anonymous access and specify the URL here.

   - **Subscription** - This is your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure subscription.

   - **Resource Group** - Select an existing resource group, or create a new one by typing a name for your new resource group. Note that to create a Service Fabric cluster, the resource group must contain no other resources.

   - **Location** - This will be `frn00006`, which is the Azure Stack Hub region.
