# UKCloud for Microsoft Azure known issues

## Overview

This guide describes some of the issues you may encounter when using UKCloud for Microsoft Azure. More known issues can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/operator/azure-stack-release-notes-known-issues-1906).

## Diagnostics do not work for Linux VMs

### Cause

If you enable Microsoft Insights for your subscription (**Subscriptions > Resource providers > Microsoft.Insights** and then click subscribe), you'll have access to Azure Monitoring for Windows VMs only. This feature is not yet available for Linux VMs as documented [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-metrics-azure-data#application---diagnostics-logs-application-logs-and-metrics).

### Solution

There is currently no workaround for this issue.
