# How to create a virtual machine using the Azure Stack portal

## Overview

With UKCloud for Microsoft Azure, you can leverage the power of Microsoft Azure to create virtual machines (VMs) for your on-premises applications. As UKCloud for Microsoft Azure is built on UKCloudâ€™s assured, UK-sovereign multi-cloud platform, those applications can work alongside other cloud platforms, such as Oracle, VMware and OpenStack, and benefit from native connectivity to non-cloud workloads in Crown Hosting and government community networks, including PSN, HSCN and RLI.

### Intended audience

To complete the steps in this guide, you must have appropriate access to a subscription in the UKCloud Azure Stack portal.

## Creating a virtual machine

VMs provide the basic compute building blocks in Azure Stack. You can create VMs using the Azure Stack Marketplace, which provides access to pre-created images to quickly deploy the VMs you need to build your applications. Microsoft makes Azure Marketplace images available for Azure Stack once they have passed an accreditation process. If you cannot find the image you require in the Azure Stack Marketplace please raise a support call via the UKCloud portal and if possible we will make your requested image available in Azure Stack Marketplace.

**To create a VM from the Azure Marketplace:**

1. Log in to the UKCloud Azure Stack portal.

   For more detailed instructions, see the [*Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for Microsoft Azure*](azs-gs.md).

2. In the favourites panel, select **Create a resource**.
