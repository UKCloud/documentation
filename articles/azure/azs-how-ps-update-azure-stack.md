# Azure Stack Update Procedure

This guide is intended to provide a reference on how can we perform Azure Stack Updates.

Loosely based on [Azure Stack Apply Updates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-apply-updates).

## Prerequisites

Prerequisites from a Windows-based external client.

* PowerShell 5.1

* Azure Stack PowerShell Modules -> [Azure Stack Modules Install Guide](https://github.com/UKCloud/AzureStack/blob/master/docs/Tenants/PowerShell/ConfigurePowerShellEnvironment.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always consult Microsoft documentation for your specific Update Version
>
> Example -> [1802 Update](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-update-1802)

> [!CAUTION]
> In the 1802 example you can see that you need to install a Hotfix before you apply the upgrade. That is one of the many reasons why you should always check the official documentation.

## High Level Overview of the process

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> We strongly recommend that you notify users of any maintenance operations, and that you schedule normal maintenance windows during non-business hours as much as possible. Maintenance operations may affect both user workloads and portal operations.

1. Raise a pre-emptive case with Microsoft prior to starting the Update.

2. Go to the **Update** blade on the Administration Portal.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > From 1807 onwards you no longer need to download Update and Hotfix packages manually.
    >
    > They are automatically pulled by Azure Stack itself and will show as **update available** in the portal.

3. Start the Update process.

> [!NOTE]
> Automatic Update Guide to follow
>
> You can find the code for automatic updates [here](https://github.com/UKCloud/AZS_dev_black/tree/master/docs/code/powershell/UpdateManagement).
