# How to resize virtual machine disks

In this article we will cover the process of resizing disks in the Azure portal. If your VM requires more storage space, you can increase the current disk capacity, rather than adding more disks. You can do this in the Azure portal.

## Resizing disk size via the portal

These steps will work for both unmanaged and managed VMs.

1. Power down or detach the disk from the VM.

2. Navigate to the resource group.

3. Select the disk that you want to resize.

4. In the **Size** field, enter the new size for the disk.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The maximum size for a single disk is 4TB.
  
5. Save your changes.

6. Power back on the VM or reattach the disk.
