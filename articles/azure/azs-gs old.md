# Getting started guide for Sovereign Azure BETA

## Introduction

UKCloud's Sovereign Azure service provides you with new options to harness Microsoft Azure alongside other cloud platform, including Oracle, VMware and OpenStack. This gives you the flexibility to accommodate diverse workloads within a low-latency, accredited platform with native connectivity to non-cloud workloads in Crown Hosting and the networks that are vital to the Public Sector: from PSN Protected to HSCN and RLI.

This getting started guide provides you with the information you need to get up and running with your Sovereign Azure service.

### Intended audience

To complete the steps in this guide, you must have access to UKCloud's Azure Stack portal.

## Sovereign Azure overview

At UKCloud, we understand that there is no "one size fits all" solution. There are usually many factors to consider when looking to move your applications to the cloud, including existing technology investment and skills. Additionally, while some applications can easily move to the public cloud, there are others that for various reasons (latency, connectivity, security, regulation) must run on-premises.

Microsoft Azure Stack is an extension of Azure that provides on-premises Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), enabling you to leverage the benefits of cloud in an on-premises environment. The Sovereign Azure service brings the advantages of the Microsoft Cloud platform to our assured UK-sovereign platform, helping you realise the benefits that a true hybrid cloud environment has to offer, while balancing the right amount of flexibility and control.

With Sovereign Azure, you can:

- Leverage existing Azure investment, knowledge and skills
- Use Azure Stack alongside other technologies, for example, VMware, OpenStack or Oracle
- Connect to government community networks, including PSN, HSCN, Janet and RLI
- Meet specific compliance directives, such as data sovereignty or security

The two main delivery models provided by our Sovereign Azure service are:

- A multi-tenant IaaS and PaaS platform available in both UKCloud security domains (Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL), connected to government community networks with UKCloud's award-winning support
- Private cloud deployment of Sovereign Azure dedicated to a single customer

## Before you begin

You should have received your Sovereign Azure login credentials from your Sovereign Azure administrator. If you're the administrator, your Customer Success Manager (CSM) will have provided you with your credentials.

## Logging in to the Microsoft Azure Stack portal

To manage your Sovereign Azure service, you need to log in to UKCloud's Azure Stack portal. The portal provides access to all your Sovereign Azure resources.

**To log in to the Azure Stack portal:**

1. In your browser, go to the following URL:

2. In the login dialog box, enter the email address for your Sovereign Azure account and click **Next**, or pick your account.

- An **offer** is a collection of one or more *plans*
- A **plan** is a collection of one or more *services*, with associated *quotas*
