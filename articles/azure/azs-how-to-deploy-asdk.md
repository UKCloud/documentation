# Deploy and configure the Azure Stack Development Kit
The Azure Stack Development kit is a single server instance of Azure Stack. It is not fit for production workloads and has some subtle differences vs the real Azure Stack integrate appliance, however for most test scenarios it will suffice.

The ASDK is used in two modes within UKCloud:

* Physical hardware (pre-production) - Community support with Microsoft
* Virtual servers (development and testing) - not officially supported by Microsoft
This document covers two scenarios, building from scratch and redeploying.

## Step 1 - Hardware pre-reqs
Detailed specs are here - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-deploy

|Device  |Details  |
|---------|---------|
|CPU    |  >=16 cores       |
|RAM     | >=128GB        |
|OS Disks |  >=200GB       |
|Data Disks  | >=4 * >=250G        |

**Virtualisation Note:** VMware HW must be >=11, CPU virtual extension pass-through must be enabled

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you deploy your VM with Hardware Version 11 and Operating System Family as Windows Server 2016 you will not be able to create S2D Cluster as disk UUIDs are not exposed.
>
>Either create it with Windows Server 2012 and change later or in Configuration Parameters ->  Click Add Row. In the Name column, enter disk.EnableUUID.  In the Value column, enter TRUE. This will show correct disk IDs in Get-PhysicalDisk cmdlets and cluster should build.

**Physical Note:** The first two drives must be setup as a RAID 1, the rest passed through as a JBOD; additionally, you need to specify your VLAN as ACCESS in the CIMC

## Step 2 - Install base operating system
Install Windows Server 2016 to the OS disk implementing a static IP address.

**Physical Note:** This the RAID 1 disk, the following drivers must be downloaded, extracted and installed:

https://software.cisco.com/download/release.html?mdfid=286281356&softwareid=283291009&os=Windows%202016%2064-bit&release=3.0(3a)&relind=AVAILABLE&rellifecycle=&reltype=latest

**Virtualisation Note:** VMware tools must be installed and the VMware Tools drivers must be exported onto the c:\ drive (VMwareKB), also disks have to be online and initialised as MBR

## Step 3 - Initial setup
Download the appliance and prep the virtual disk (vhdx) for the ASDK.

Implement the following steps from the guide: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-run-powershell-script

* Download and extract the development kit
* Prepare the development kit host

**Virtualisation Note:** Before running the installer open, "C:\AzureStack_Installer\asdk-installer.ps1" and edit as follows:

|Line Number  |Current Code  |Details  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|1372     |  `elseif ((get-disk | Where-Object {$_.isboot -eq $true}).Model -match 'Virtual Disk') {`       |  `elseif ((get-disk | Where-Object {$_.isboot -eq $true}).Model -match 'null') {`       |

To run:

 ```
 "C:\AzureStack_Installer\asdk-installer.ps1"  | ForEach {($_ -replace "elseif \(\(get-disk \| Where-Object \`{\`$`_.isboot -eq \`$true\`}\).Model -match 'Virtual Disk'\) \`{", "elseif ((get-disk | Where-Object {`$====_.isboot -eq `$true}).Model -match 'null') {") -replace "====",""} | Set-Content "C:\AzureStack_Installer\asdk-installer.ps1" -force
 ```

 To verify:

 ```
 Select-String -Path "C:\AzureStack_Installer\asdk-installer.ps1" -pattern "elseif \(\(get-disk \| Where-Object \`{\`$`_.isboot -eq \`$true\`}\).Model -match 'null'\) \`{"
 ```
The following details should be used:

|Option |Parameter  |
|---------|---------|
|NTP |   13.79.239.69      |
|DNS Forwarder|  8.8.8.8       |
|Drivers | Browse to path of either the extracted Cisco drivers or the extracted VMware tools        |
|Computer Name |Anything but "azurestack", eg: "azurestackhost"         |
|Static IP | IP details assigned to the current interface        |

Once step 3 is complete the box will have been rebooted from the vhdx downloaded above.

## Step 4 - Install ASDK

Implement the following steps from the guide: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-run-powershell-script

* Deploy the development kit

The following details should be used:

|Option  |Parameter  |
|---------|---------|
|NTP |     13.79.239.69    |
|DNS Forwarder |   8.8.8.8      |
|Type |    Azure AAD, this should be either your own Azure AD account where you are the system admin or one you have setup for Azure Stack. e.g. joebloggsukcloud.onmicrosoft.com     |
|Static IP | Different IP than what you currently have - eg. 10.0.0.101 was my box 10.0.0.191 I set up - or just current IP + 1        |

**Physical Note:** Before running the installation, make sure only one network adapter is enabled, otherwise install will fail.

For some reason the driver injection does not work and you have to manually add Ethernet Adapters from Device Manager, then disable everything but management-0. Configure its IP address and then run the install.

**Important:** 1803 install failed with the error below.

```

Invoke-EceAction : Type 'Deployment' of Role 'Domain' raised an exception:
'AzS-DC01' failed to start.
Virtual machine 'AzS-DC01' could not be started because the hypervisor is not running.
'AzS-DC01' failed to start. (Virtual machine ID DA2A3A2D-F30B-42C3-AB39-C4BF11E07CEE)
Virtual machine 'AzS-DC01' could not be started because the hypervisor is not running (Virtual machine ID
DA2A3A2D-F30B-42C3-AB39-C4BF11E07CEE).
The following actions may help you resolve the problem:
1) Verify that the processor of the physical computer has a supported version of hardware-assisted virtualization.
2) Verify that hardware-assisted virtualization and hardware-assisted data execution protection are enabled in the
BIOS of the physical computer. (If you edit the BIOS to enable either setting, you must turn off the power to the
physical computer and then turn it back on. Resetting the physical computer is not sufficient.)
3) If you have made changes to the Boot Configuration Data store, review these changes to ensure that the hypervisor
is configured to launch automatically.

Verification of Physical kit showed that Virtualisation is in fact enabled but Hyper-V is not starting on boot.

To verify run you can run systeminfo and it will show whether BIOS is set correctly etc... In our case it was set correctly. Only Boot settings were not.

To fix it run from elevated command/powershell prompt:

```
BCDEDIT /Set {current} hypervisorlaunchtype auto
```
Then reboot the box and conitnue the install.

Example of Automated Physical Kit Deployment:

```powershell
$adminpass = ConvertTo-SecureString 'Password123' -AsPlainText -Force
$unameS = "azurestackadmin@<domain>.onmicrosoft.com"
$credsS = "<password>"
    $userPasswordS = ConvertTo-SecureString "$credsS" -AsPlainText -Force
    $credentialsS = new-object -typename System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -argumentlist $unameS,$userPasswordS
 
cd C:\CloudDeployment\Setup
.\InstallAzureStackPOC.ps1 -AdminPassword $adminpass -InfraAzureDirectoryTenantAdminCredential $credentialsS -InfraAzureDirectoryTenantName <domain>.onmicrosoft.com -NatIPv4Subnet 51.179.198.224/28 -NatIPv4Address 51.179.198.227 -NatIPv4DefaultGateway 51.179.198.225 -DNSForwarder 8.8.8.8 -TimeServer 13.79.239.69
```
**Virtualisation Note:** after completing the wizard BUT before clicking install copy the command as the install will fail.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the installer cannot see any network adapters - you can install manually VMware Tools and reboot the box. It will work then.

```
E:\AzureStack_Installer\asdk-installer.ps1
 
Initialize environment. Please wait...
```
This will just end with nothing.

Then you need to run the copied InstallAzureStackPOC.ps1 to create the Roles directory.

Open, "C:\CloudDeployment\Roles\PhysicalMachines\Tests\BareMetal.Tests.ps1" and edit as follows:

|Line Number |Current code  |Details  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|521    |  `$physicalMachine.IsVirtualMachine | Should Be $false`       |  `$physicalMachine.IsVirtualMachine | Should Be $true`       |
|521     |   `($physicalMachine.Processors.NumberOfEnabledCores | Measure-Object -Sum).Sum | Should Not BeLessThan $minimumNumberOfCoresPerMachine`      | `($physicalMachine.Processors.NumberOfEnabledCores | Measure-Object -Sum).Sum | Should Not BeLessThan 0`        |

To edit run:

 ```
(gc "C:\CloudDeployment\Roles\PhysicalMachines\Tests\BareMetal.Tests.ps1") | ForEach {$_ -replace  "\`$physicalMachine.IsVirtualMachine \| Should Be \`$false","`$physicalMachine.IsVirtualMachine | Should Be `$true"} | Set-Content “C:\CloudDeployment\Roles\PhysicalMachines\Tests\BareMetal.Tests.ps1” -Force
```
And then run:
```
(gc "C:\CloudDeployment\Roles\PhysicalMachines\Tests\BareMetal.Tests.ps1") | ForEach {$_ -replace "\(\`$physicalMachine.Processors.NumberOfEnabledCores \| Measure-Object -Sum\).Sum \| Should Not BeLessThan \`$minimumNumberOfCoresPerMachine", "(`$physicalMachine.Processors.NumberOfEnabledCores | Measure-Object -Sum).Sum | Should Not BeLessThan 0"} | Set-Content “C:\CloudDeployment\Roles\PhysicalMachines\Tests\BareMetal.Tests.ps1” -Force
 ```
 To verify run:
 ```
Select-String -Path "C:\CloudDeployment\Roles\PhysicalMachines\Tests\BareMetal.Tests.ps1" -pattern "\`$physicalMachine.IsVirtualMachine \| Should Be \`$true"
Select-String -Path "C:\CloudDeployment\Roles\PhysicalMachines\Tests\BareMetal.Tests.ps1" -pattern "\(\`$physicalMachine.Processors.NumberOfEnabledCores \| Measure-Object -Sum\).Sum \| Should Not BeLessThan 0"
 ```
After you modified it, run:

```powershell
$adminpass = ConvertTo-SecureString 'Password123'-AsPlainText -Force
$unameS = "azurestackadmin@<domain>.onmicrosoft.com"
$credsS = "<password>"
    $userPasswordS = ConvertTo-SecureString "$credsS" -AsPlainText -Force
    $credentialsS = new-object -typename System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -argumentlist $unameS,$userPasswordS
 
cd C:\CloudDeployment\Setup
.\InstallAzureStackPOC.ps1 -AdminPassword $adminpass -InfraAzureDirectoryTenantAdminCredential $credentialsS -InfraAzureDirectoryTenantName <domain>.onmicrosoft.com -NatIPv4Subnet 10.0.0.0/24 -NatIPv4Address 10.0.0.191 -NatIPv4DefaultGateway 10.0.0.1 -DNSForwarder 8.8.8.8 -TimeServer 13.79.239.69
```
If you do not set the InfraAzureDirectoryTenantAdminCredential, a few minutes after you run the script, you will get prompted for AAD Account - use azurestackadmin@<domain>.onmicrosoft.com
