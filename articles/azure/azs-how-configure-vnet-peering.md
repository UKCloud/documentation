# How to configure virtual network peering between two virtual networks using the UKCloud Azure Stack Hub portal

## Overview

Overview 

### Intended audience

Audience

## Process Overview

Bellow is a shot overview of the proces. To complete the steps in this guide, you must have appropriate access to a subscription in the Azure Stack Hub portal.

1. [Create two virtual networks in Azure Stack Hub](#Create-two-virtual-networks-in-Azure-Stack-Hub)
2. [Create a virtual machine in each Virtual Network](#Create-a-Virtual-Machine-in-each-Virtual-Network)
3. [Configure virtual network peering](#Configure-virtual-network-peering)
4. 

## Create two virtual networks in Azure Stack Hub

First, you'll need to create two virtual networks. These virtual networks will be able to communicate with eachother. 

> [!NOTE]
> This is a not btw :)

1. Log in to the [Azure Stack Hub portal](https://portal.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com).

2. In the favourites panel, select **Create a resource**.

3. In the **New** blade, select **Networking**.

4. In the **Featured** section, select **Virtual network**.

5. In the **Create virtual network** blade, enter the following information:

   - **Subscription** - This is your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure subscription.

   - **Resource Group** - Select an existing resource group, or create a new one by typing a name for your new resource group.
   
    - **Name** - The name of the virtual network.

   - **Location** - This will be `frn00006`, which is the location of the Azure Stack Hub.

     ![Create new virtual network](images/azs-portal-vnet-config-1.png)

    - **Address Space** - The virtual network's address range in CIDR notation.

   - **Subnet** - The subnet's address range in CIDR notation (for example, 10.10.0.0). It must be contained by the address space of the virtual network. The address range of a subnet which is in use can't be edited.

   - **Subnet Name** - The name of the first subnet within the virtual network.

> [!NOTE]
> When creating the second virtual network, make sure to use a different address space than the first, otherwise they will not be able to communicate 

6. Click **Create**.

7. After your virtual network has deployed, you can view it by clicking **All services** in the favourites panel, then selecting **Virtual networks** under the networking section, or it appears inside the resource group.

8. Select your virtual network from the list.

9. In the blade for your virtual network, you can view and monitor the virtual network, change its settings and perform diagnostics and troubleshooting.

10. Repeat the steps above for the second virtual network, but use different address spaces.

## Create a Virtual Machine in each Virtual Network

After creating each virtual network, create a virtual machine in each virtual network.

For more detailed instructions on how to create a virtal machine, see the [*How to create a virtual machine using the UKCloud Azure Stack Hub portal*](azs-how-create-vm-portal.md).

## Configure virtual network peering

1. Click on one of the created virtual netowrks and click **Add**

2. In the Add peering, enter the following information:

    - **Name** - The name of the connection from A-B.

    - **Peer Details** - ?

    - **Subscription** - This is your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure subscription.

    - **Virtual Network** - The virtual network you want to peer to.

    - **Name** - The name of the connection from B-A.

    - **Allow virtual network access** - Allows access between virtual networks.

    - **Allow forwarded traffic** - This setting allows the peerâ€™s forwarded traffic into your virtual network.

    - **Configure gateway traffic** - Allows the peer virtual network to use your virtual network gateway.

3. Click **OK**

### Testing connection

{ - could link to new part of guide for connecting to vm

To test the connection you need to allow your pc through the nsg to use rdp and access the vm

1. Go into each nsg, click on imbound security rules and click add

2. Fill out the perameters 

    - **source** ip address
    - **source port ranges** * (any)
    - **destination** set to your public IP
    - **destination port** set to 3389 (rdp)
    - **protocl** any
    - **action** allow
    - **priority** bump it up abit
    - **name** name the rule
    - **descripton** Describe the rule

3. Click **Add**

> [!NOTE]
> repeat for each nsg

}

To test the connection by pinging one of the virtual machines from the other. To do this, some firewall rules needs to be allowed in each virtual machine.

1. Go to the virtual machine and connect to it by downloading the RDP file.

![Configure virtual netork peering](images/azs-portal-peering-5.png)

> [!NOTE]
> The device you are connecting from must be allowed through the virtual machine NSG on port 3389.

2. Launch the RDP file and log in with the correct credentials for the virtual machine.

3. Access the firewall advanced security (Settings>Update & Security>Windows Security>Firewall & network protection>Advanced settings) 

4. Click on **Inbound Rules**, scroll down to *file and printer sharing (echo request - icmpv4-in)* and allow it through the firewall

5. Repeat for each virtual machine

6. From one of the virtual machines, the connection can be tested by pinging the other.

## Hub and Spoke virtual network peering

The hub is a virtual network in Azure that acts as a central point of connectivity to your on-premises network. The spokes are virtual networks that peer with the hub.

### Configuring the Hub

1. create hub vnet

2. create vpn gateway in the vnet with a pub ip

**image of creating vnet gateway**

3. Create spoke vnet

4. add peering to hub

5. add peering to both sides
