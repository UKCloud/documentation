# Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for Microsoft Azure

## Overview

UKCloud for Microsoft Azure provides you with new options to harness Microsoft Azure alongside other cloud platforms, including Oracle, VMware and OpenStack. This gives you the flexibility to accommodate diverse workloads within a low latency, accredited platform with native connectivity to non-cloud workloads in Crown Hosting and the networks that are vital to the public sector: from PSN Protected to HSCN and RLI.

This Getting Started Guide provides you with the information you need to get up and running with UKCloud for Microsoft Azure.

### Intended audience

To complete the steps in this guide you must have access to the Azure Stack portal.

## Introduction to UKCloud for Microsoft Azure

At UKCloud, we understand that there is no "one cloud fits all" solution. There are usually many factors to consider when looking to move your applications to the cloud, including existing technology investment and skills. Additionally, while some applications can easily move to the public cloud, there are others that for various reasons (latency, connectivity, security, regulation) must run on-premises.

Microsoft Azure Stack is an extension of Azure that provides on-premises Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), enabling you to leverage the benefits of cloud in an on-premises environment. UKCloud for Microsoft Azure brings the advantages of the Microsoft Cloud platform to our assured UK-sovereign platform, helping you realise the benefits that a true hybrid cloud environment has to offer, while balancing the right amount of flexibility and control.

With UKCloud for Microsoft Azure you can:

- Leverage existing Azure investment, knowledge and skills
- Use Azure Stack alongside other technologies, for example, VMware, OpenStack or Oracle
- Connect to government community networks, including PSN, HSCN, Janet and RLI
- Meet specific compliance directives, such as data sovereignty or security

The two main delivery models provided by UKCloud for Microsoft Azure are:

- A multi-tenant IaaS and PaaS platform available in both UKCloud security domains (Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL), connected to government community networks with UKCloud's award-winning support
- Private cloud deployment of UKCloud for Microsoft Azure dedicated to a single customer

## Before you begin

You should have received your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure login credentials from your Azure administrator. If you're the administrator, your Customer Success Manager (CSM) will have provided you with your login credentials.

## Logging in to the Microsoft Azure Stack portal

To manage UKCloud for Microsoft Azure, you need to log in to the Azure Stack portal. The portal provides access to all your Azure resources.

To log in to the Azure Stack portal:

1. In your browser, go to the following URL:

    <https://portal.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com/>

2. In the login dialog box, enter the email address for your account and click **Next**, or pick your account.

3. Enter your password and click **Sign in**.

4. After you log in, you'll see the main Azure Stack portal home page.

    ![Azure Stack portal home page](images/azs-portal-home.png)

    On this page, you'll see:

    A.  **Favourites** - quickly access your most used resources (see [Customising your favourites](#customising-your-favourites))

    B.  **Dashboard** - access information about your Azure resources (see [Customising and adding dashboards](#customising-and-adding-dashboards))

    C.  **Settings** - change your portal settings, for example, theme and language

    D.  **Notifications** - view useful alerts about your Azure environment

    E.  **New** - create new resources, such as virtual machines (see [*How to create a virtual machine from the Azure Marketplace*](azs-how-create-vm.md))

## Understanding subscriptions, offers and plans

Your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure environment is provisioned with a subscription that determines the services you have access to, and your quotas for those services.

- A **subscription** is a mechanism for signing up to an *offer*.
- An **offer** is a collection of one or more *plans*.
- A **plan** is a collection of one or more *services*, with associated *quotas*.

## Customising your favourites

In the Azure Stack portal, down the left-hand side, you can see a list of your favourite resources. You can customise this list to include the resources that you access most frequently.

1. In the favourites list, click the **More services** link.
