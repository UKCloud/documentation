# Requesting Janet connectivity to your UKCloud workloads

To request Janet connectivity to your UKCloud workloads, you must first be authorised by Jisc. If you have not already completed this process, you'll need to contact Jisc at <https://www.jisc.ac.uk/contact>.

Once authorised, you'll need to raise a Service Request via [My Calls](https://portal.ukcloud.com/support/ivanti) and identify the virtual data centre (VDC) that you want to have network access. As standard, you'll be provisioned with one IP address, however there is an an option to have additional IP addresses (at the standard cost of £20 per IP) if there is a justified business case.

> [!NOTE]
> It may take up to two working days to provision this connection.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can view Jisc's Acceptable Use Policy at <https://community.jisc.ac.uk/library/acceptable-use-policy>.
