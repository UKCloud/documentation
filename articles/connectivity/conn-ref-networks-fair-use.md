# Networks fair use policy

## Overview

This article outlines what is considered to be fair use of UKCloud network access across the UKCloud multi-cloud platform.

## Policy scope

The networks fair use policy includes:

- Private networks within UKCloud
- External networks that UKCloud is providing shared use of for the purposes of data transfer, including, but not limited to, internet, Janet, PSN and HSCN.

## Policy statements

Applications of this policy:

1. The networks fair use policy ensures that all customers who choose a shared network connection get a fair share of the use of that resource, and that no customer is disadvantaged by the conduct of others.

2. The networks fair use policy ensures that UKCloud can monitor network usage and ensure that customers do not excessively use network bandwidth to the detriment of other customers.

3. UKCloud has the right to vary the terms of this networks fair use policy at UKCloud's sole discretion.

4. UKCloud may rely on its networks fair use policy where any customer's usage of the service is deemed to be causing disruption to other customers using the same shared network.

5. Where UKCloud identifies a customer who persistently exceeds their fair share of network bandwidth, we will contact them and work with them to identify ways to more fairly utilise the resource or a more appropriate product or service level for their requirements.

6. If a customer's network usage remains at a level that is disrupting other customers, UKCloud reserves the right to apply a Quality of Service network policy to limit network usage and ensure that fair use is maintained for all customers.

7. This policy is supplementary to customer obligations outlined in UKCloud's Master Services Agreement (MSA).

## Responsibilities

The administration of this policy requires the exercise of discretion and judgement. UKCloud will exercise good faith in the administration of this policy and in making determinations under the policy.
