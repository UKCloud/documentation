# Global load balancing Service Scope

## About this document

This document is intended to provide additional information regarding the optional Global load balancing service that is available for UKCloud services within the UKCloud for VMware service description. For additional information, please refer to the [*Global load balancing FAQs*](conn-faq-glb.md).

## About Global load balancer

This service is aimed at providing a secure and reliable managed DNS service to help businesses enable and protect their online presence. It ensures a high level of website availability and optimal performance, with built-in security for superior protection that is scalable to future demands.

It enables customers to direct Internet traffic between multiple end-points which can be across different sites or different platforms.

UKCloud have partnered with Neustar for the provision of this service along with the additional option of Application-tuned DDoS protection for a complete traffic protection solution.

## Traffic management services

Basic traffic routing services for monitored load balancing and failover are included services with the Global Load Balancing service. Monitor and automatically load balance or failover traffic at the DNS level by distributing traffic among multiple servers. Our advanced traffic routing services help to further optimise your traffic, allowing granular control of load balancing and failover options to configure different thresholds for notifications and traffic routing actions.

## Monitoring and failover

The service monitors and automatically fails over DNS traffic in the event of underperforming or unavailable servers. Utilising a network of monitoring servers, you can select specific records to monitor and, if needed, have traffic redirected to a "hot" standby. Comprehensive server- specific health checks further ensure your DNS traffic flows without interruption.

## Traffic controller

The service optimises traffic and network performance at the DNS level. Based on parameters you set, weighted load balancing lets you distribute traffic among multiple servers. This allows you to increase the performance and scalability of your service applications while reducing the costs of data centres utilised as back-ups.

## Directional DNS

Accelerate service and enable localised website content routing by IP, Autonomous System Number (ASN), and combine with Geolocation for highly targeted routing solutions.

## Portal access

Once the service is provisioned, access details for your web-based portal will be supplied to you. This portal will allow you complete control over the solution, and settings for traffic and mitigation.

The service is delivered as a managed service by Neustar and they are responsible for monitoring traffic, the availability of servers and taking necessary actions to prevent a loss of service. However, the performance of the service is reliant on the details and settings within the portal. It is important that you ensure as much detail is supplied to Neustar on the expected traffic, spikes in traffic and preferences on traffic routing.

## Service provisioning

Once a contract is signed by the customer, the service will be provisioned by Neustar who will then directly provide portal access details. The time to provision will depend on complexity of the solution.
