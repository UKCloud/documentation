# Cross Domain Security Zone Service Definition

## Why UKCloud?

UKCloud is dedicated to helping the UK Public Sector and UK citizens by delivering more choice and flexibility through safe and trusted cloud technology. We own and operate a UK-sovereign, industry-leading, multi-cloud platform, located within the Government’s Crown Campus, offering multiple cloud technologies, including VMware, Azure, OpenStack, OpenShift and Oracle. This enables customers to choose the right technology for creating new workloads or migrating existing applications to the cloud.

We recognise the importance of government services in making the country run smoothly, which is why we include the highest level of support to all our customers at no extra cost. This includes a dedicated 24/7 UK telephone and ticket support, and Network Operations Centre (NOC) utilising protective and proactive monitoring tools, and access to UKCloud’s technical experts.

## What is Cross Domain Security Zone?

The UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone (CDSZ) enables you to securely transfer data between the UKCloud Assured OFFICIAL cloud platform and the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform, using National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)-approved cross-domain security patterns.

## What the service can help you achieve

- Create secure applications that are accessible to citizens, but ensure data safety

- Reduce your infrastructure and compliance costs, by leveraging UKCloud’s ready-made solutions

- Ensure your solutions are aligned with information security requirements

- Meet changing requirements by controlling and adapting the service

## Product options

The UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone helps you achieve the goals of the Government Digital Strategy by making government community–facing (for example, PSN) applications available to citizens and industry via the internet. It's ideal for solutions where service accessibility and data security are key underpinning principles, including the enablement of highly sensitive data and workloads in OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE and above OFFICIAL (utilising the UKCloudX platform).

### Walled Garden

We provide self-service access to the Cross Domain Security Zone so that you can design, implement and manage your own Walled Garden, using technology and application services of your choice. We provide an assurance wrap by managing firewalls between the security zones and ensuring you use appropriate risk management to understand and mitigate identified risks.

The Walled Garden is ideal for organisations that require more control and flexibility over what is passed between security domains, to support a wider range of use cases.

## Accreditation and information assurance

The security of our platform is our number one priority. We’ve always been committed to adhering to exacting standards, frameworks and best practice.

## Connectivity options
