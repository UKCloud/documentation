# Cross Domain Security Zone Service Definition

## What is Cross Domain Security Zone?

The Cross Domain Security Zone (CDSZ) enables you to securely transfer data between the UKCloud Assured OFFICIAL security domain and the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL security domain, using National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)-approved cross-domain security patterns.

## What the service can help you achieve

- Create secure applications that are accessible to citizens, but ensure data safety

- Reduce your infrastructure and compliance costs by leveraging UKCloud's ready-made solutions

- Ensure your solutions are aligned with information security requirements

- Meet changing requirements by controlling and adapting the service

## Product options

The Cross Domain Security Zone helps you achieve the goals of the Government Digital Strategy by making government community-facing (for example, PSN) applications available to citizens and industry via the internet. It's ideal for solutions where service accessibility and data security are key underpinning principles, including the enablement of highly sensitive data and workloads in OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE and above OFFICIAL (utilising the Tier 2 platform).

### Walled Garden

We provide self-service access to the Cross Domain Security Zone so that you can design, implement and manage your own walled garden, using technology and application services of your choice. We provide an assurance wrap by managing firewalls between the security zones and ensuring you use appropriate risk management to understand and mitigate identified risks.

Cross Domain Security Zone pricing can be as low as £500 per month. Full pricing with all options is available in the [UKCloud Pricing Guide](https://ukcloud.com/pricing-guide).

## Accreditation and information assurance

The security of our platform is our number one priority. We've always been committed to adhering to exacting standards, frameworks and best practice. Everything we do is subject to regular independent validation by government accreditors, sector auditors and management system assessors. Details are available on the [UKCloud website](https://ukcloud.com/governance/).

## Connectivity options

UKCloud provides one of the best-connected cloud platforms for the UK Public Sector. We enable access to our secure platform by DDoS-protected internet, PSN, Janet, HSCN, RLI and your own leased lines via our HybridConnect or CrownConnect services. The full range of flexible connectivity options is detailed in the [UKCloud Pricing Guide](https://ukcloud.com/pricing-guide).

## An SLA you can trust
