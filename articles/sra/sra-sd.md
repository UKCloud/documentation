# Secure Remote Access Service Definition

## Why UKCloud?

UKCloud is dedicated to helping the UK Public Sector and UK citizens by delivering more choice and flexibility through safe and trusted cloud technology. We own and operate a UK-sovereign, industry-leading, multi-cloud platform, located within the Government’s Crown Campus, offering multiple cloud technologies, including VMware, Azure, OpenStack, OpenShift and Oracle. This enables customers to choose the right technology for creating new workloads or migrating existing applications to the cloud.

We recognise the importance of government services in making the country run smoothly, which is why we include the highest level of support to all our customers at no extra cost. This includes a dedicated 24/7 UK telephone and ticket support, and Network Operations Centre (NOC) utilising protective and proactive monitoring tools, and access to UKCloud’s technical experts.

## What is Secure Remote Access?

The UKCloud Secure Remote Access (SRA) service enables you to securely connect to the UKCloud platform's Elevated OFFICIAL security domain using NCSC-approved internet virtual private network (VPN) technologies and the 'walled garden' architectural pattern.

System administrators and mobile workers can securely access workloads running on Elevated OFFICIAL from locations that don't have alternative secure network connections such as PSN.

SRA uses NCSC Assured VPN technologies and the secure ‘walled garden’ architectural pattern:

- Providing flexible connectivity for remote administrators and mobile workers to the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform

- Delivered as a cloud service — no need to purchase and manage NCSC-approved VPN hardware

- With a flexible application process with a self-assessment route for customers with simple implementations, an assurance review approach with UKCloud’s experienced professionals for more complex implementations.
