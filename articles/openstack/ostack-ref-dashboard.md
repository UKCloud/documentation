# Introduction to the OpenStack dashboard

UKCloud for OpenStack has been designed specifically for cloud native applications and is powered by Red Hat's Enterprise OpenStack Platform.

For an overview on how to use OpenStack's Horizon dashboard (based upon the Newton release) to drive the platform, see the following OpenStack document:
