## Platform management

UKCloud for OpenStack is managed directly by the customer, using OpenStack's Horizon dashboard, the UKCloud Portal, and APIs associated with both.

## Service provisioning

You can request UKCloud for OpenStack via your Technical Account Manager or by using the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal.

Within 4 business hours of accepting an order, UKCloud will create the customer's Primary Administrator account and send a Welcome Pack which includes the URL for the UKCloud Portal, and the Getting Started Guide.

## Customer responsibilities

The control and management of access and responsibilities for end users including appropriate connectivity, security and accreditation if required. If access is required over government secure networks such as N3/HSCN, Janet, RLI or PSN (including legacy networks), the customer is responsible for adhering to the Code of Connection.

Self-managing the environment including VM deployment, virtual network configuration, storage management, and so on.

Maintaining a master copy or backup copy of the data used in the UKCloud for OpenStack service.

Ensuring only appropriate data (for example OFFICIAL) is stored and processed by applications on this environment and that they comply with the UKCloud Security Operating Procedures (SyOps) and other Information Assurance requirements as specified in the UKCloud System Interconnect and Security Policy (SISP) and associated accreditation documentation sets.

## Default network limits

By default, we will place the following network limitations per project:

- 3 x Floating IP Addresses
- 2 x Network Routers

Customers with requirements beyond these limits can raise a service request via My Calls to have these limits per project considered for raising.

## Compute virtual resource limits

By default, we will place the following virtual resource limitations per project:

- 100 Instances
- 100 vCPU
- 200 GiB RAM
- 2 TiB Persistent block storage

Customers with requirements beyond these limits can raise a service request via My Calls to have these limits per project considered for raising.

## Platform Operation Request Limits

Although designed to be a large-scale cloud platform, we strongly advise that when performing operations/requests against UKCloud for OpenStack you perform these actions in batches of no more than 30 (for example, only creating batches of up to 30 new instances in a single request). Additional requests can then be made to the platform for subsequent batches.

## Published features not currently available

The following features published in the UKCloud for OpenStack Service Definition are not currently available:

- Janet & RLI connectivity

We are actively working on delivering these features and aim to have them delivered by Q4 2018.
