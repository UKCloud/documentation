# How to use the OpenStack API using an SSO enabled user

## Overview

If your OpenStack user account is SSO-enabled, and you want to use the OpenStack API you'll need to make a few changes to your downloaded OpenStack RC file. These changes allow any API calls that you make to be correctly passed to the SSO service.

## Downloading your RC file

See the *Bind your OpenStack credentials* section of [*How to use the OpenStack Command Line*](ostack-how-use-cli.md) for details on where to get your RC file. 

> [!NOTE]
> You will require the v3 version of the OpenStack RC file. 

## Modifying your RC file

Once you've downloaded your RC file, open it in your editor of choice and remove the following line: 

```bash
export OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME="Federated"
```

now add the following lines to the bottom of the file:

```bash 
export OS_IDENTITY_PROVIDER="sso"
export OS_PROTOCOL="oidc"
export OS_AUTH_TYPE="v3oidcpassword"
```

You also need to add the following items to the bottom of the file, substituting the appropriate values from the table below depending on the OpenStack regions you're connecting to:

```bash
export OS_CLIENT_ID=""
export OS_CLIENT_SECRET=""
export OS_ACCESS_TOKEN_ENDPOINT=""
```

If you're using terraform, you'll need to append the following to your file:

```bash
echo "Generating token..."#(optional)
export OS_TOKEN=$(openstack token issue -c id -f value)
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Be advised, that the token generated by the above export statement has a lifetime of a couple of hours. You'll need to re-source your RC file if you're working for extended periods.
>
> - To avoid the following error when trying to use the OpenStack CLI, it's advisable to use a seperate RC file for use with terraform:
>
>   `__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'token'`
