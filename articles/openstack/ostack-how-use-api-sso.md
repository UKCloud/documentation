# How to use the OpenStack API using an SSO enabled user

## Overview

If your OpenStack user account is SSO-enabled, and you want to use the OpenStack API you'll need to make a few changes to your downloaded OpenStack RC file. These changes allow any API calls that you make to be correctly passed to the SSO service.

## Downloading your RC file

Please see the Bind your OpenStack credentials section of [How to use the OpenStack Command Line](ostack-how-use-cli.md) on where to get your RC file. 

[!NOTE]
You will require the v3 version. 

## Modifying your RC file

Once you've downloaded your RC file, add the following lines to the bottom of the file:

```bash 
export OS_IDENTITY_PROVIDER="sso"
export OS_PROTOCOL="oidc"
export OS_AUTH_TYPE="v3oidcpassword"
```

You also need to add the following items, substituting the appropriate values from the table below depending on the OpenStack regions you're connecting to:
```bash
export OS_CLIENT_ID=""
export OS_CLIENT_SECRET=""
export OS_ACCESS_TOKEN_ENDPOINT=""
```

| Site | Variable | Value|
| ---  | ---------|------|
| Farnborough  | OS_CLIENT_ID | cni.1.frn00006 |
| &nbsp; | OS_CLIENT_SECRET | User defined |
| &nbsp; | OS_ACCESS_TOKEN_ENDPOINT | https://idp.ukcloud.com/auth/realms/client-assured/protocol/openid-connect/token |
| Corsham  | OS_CLIENT_ID | cni.1.cor00005 |
| &nbsp; | OS_CLIENT_SECRET | User defined |
| &nbsp; | OS_ACCESS_TOKEN_ENDPOINT | https://idp.ukcloud.com/auth/realms/client-assured/protocol/openid-connect/token |

You have now updated your RC file.
