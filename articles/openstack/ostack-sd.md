# UKCloud for OpenStack Service Definition

## Why UKCloud?

UKCloud is dedicated to helping the UK Public Sector and UK citizens by delivering more choice and flexibility through safe and trusted cloud technology. We own and operate a UK-sovereign, industry-leading, multi-cloud platform, located within the Government’s Crown Campus, offering multiple cloud technologies, including VMware, Azure, OpenStack, OpenShift and Oracle. This enables customers to choose the right technology for creating new workloads or migrating existing applications to the cloud.

We recognise the importance of government services in making the country run smoothly, which is why we include the highest level of support to all our customers at no extra cost. This includes a dedicated 24/7 UK telephone and ticket support, and Network Operations Centre (NOC) utilising protective and proactive monitoring tools, and access to UKCloud’s technical experts.

## What is UKCloud for OpenStack?

UKCloud for OpenStack is engineered specifically for organisations embracing digital transformation and delivering true cloud-native applications; facilitating the creation of elastic infrastructure as code, which can be built once and run anywhere at any time to take full advantage of the benefits of cloud. Powered by OpenStack®, this service provides a full suite of modern, highly scalable and flexible IaaS services that address the needs of DevOps and WebOps communities. OpenStack's ease of use and openness enables delivery of Digital by Default services and solutions.

For full information regarding this product, we have [Service Scopes](ostack-sco.md), [FAQs](ostack-faq.md), [Getting Started videos](ostack-vid-overview.md) and other relevant documents on our [Knowledge Centre](https://docs.ukcloud.com).

## What the service can help you achieve

- Deliver digital transformation projects with high levels of trust and assurance, combined with flexibility and scalability

- Develop agile and innovative cloud-native applications in line with the Twelve-Factor Application architecture on a cloud platform built specifically supporting the GDS Service Design Manual

- Meet the increasing data flood demands from IoT and edge devices through using a rapidly horizontally scaling, elastic platform

- Support your hybrid and multi-cloud cloud strategies; span across on-premises, private cloud and Crown Hosting environments

- Reduce the risk of vendor lock-in — build your environment once and run it anywhere that supports OpenStack

- Test and deploy emerging technologies such as big data analytics and containerisation natively on a cloud platform

## Product options

The service is designed to be flexible and allows you to mix and match from a range of predefined options for each instance and change them when required.

- Elevated OFFICIAL - PSN and RLI

### Instance type

Choose the instance that is the best fit to power your application

- Ephemeral - Instances that are transient

- Boot from Block - Instances that default to persistent storage

### Instance size

Define the instance size needed to power your application which can be changed to fit your requirements

- t1.nano (1vCPU, 0.5GiB)

- t1.tiny (1vCPU, 1GiB)
  
- t1.small (1vCPU, 2GiB)
  
- t1.medium (2vCPU, 2GiB)
  
- t1.large (2vCPU, 4 GiB)
