# How to find your allocated external IPÂ addresses

## Overview

To route traffic to your external network (for example internet, PSN), you need to know your  external IP addresses.

## Finding your IP addresses

To find your allocated external IP address range:

1. In the vCloud Director *Virtual Datacenters* dashboard, select the VDC that contains the edge gateway you want to configure.

2. In the left navigation panel, click **Edges**.

3. Select the edge that you want to configure.

4. In the *Edge Gateway Settings* section, in the *Sub-allocated IP Addresses* table, you'll see the range of external IP addresses allocated for your use.

    You'll need to know this range when you configure settings such as NAT rules.
