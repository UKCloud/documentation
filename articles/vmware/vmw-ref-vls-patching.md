# VMware patching requirements for VMware License Service

## Overview

The VMware Licence Service (VLS) enables you to switch to a flexible, VMware Cloud Provider Programme (VCPP) consumption-based licensing model. This service includes licensing and support for your VMware products. It does not include patching and maintenance of your VMware infrastructure.

## VMware vulnerability and patching requirements

Whilst UKCloud is responsible for ensuring that the infrastructure underpinning our own services is regularly updated and patched in a timely manner to avoid any performance, stability or security issues, it remains the customer's responsibility to perform their own maintenance, evergreening and security assurance work on any on-premises infrastructure supported by VLS.

For UKCloud to be able to provide the support offered by VLS, it's vital that you regularly check your VMware environment for any potential vulnerabilities and patching requirements and apply any updates as soon as possible. We recommend that you check the official VMware site to keep up to date with the necessary updates and patches. UKCloud may be unable to provide support if the customer's VMware estate is not correctly patched and updated.

## Additional resources

- Check [VMware Security Advisories](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories.html) for information about vulnerabilities.

- Sign up to the Security-announce mail list (available on the Security Advisories page)

- Check VMware product pages, for example ESXi and vCenter, to make sure you're using the latest versions
