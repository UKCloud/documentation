# How to create a DHCP pool

## Overview

With VDC networks you have the option of creating an IP pool of addresses to be assigned automatically or manually (known as a static IP pool). These addresses are injected into virtual machines (VMs) via VMware Tools during Guest Customisation. They appear in the usual places in Windows and Linux where you would interrogate IP settings, and show as static addresses.

In some situations, you may require true DHCP functionality in your VMs, so that IP addresses are shown as dynamically defined. As with an IP pool, you're defining a non-overlapping range of IP addresses to use on the network.

## Creating a DHCP pool for an advanced gateway

To create a DHCP pool:

1. In the vCloud Director *Virtual Datacenters* dashboard, select the VDC that contains the edge gateway in which you to create the DHCP pool.

2. In the left navigation panel, click **Edges**.

3. Select the edge that you want to configure and click **Configure Services**.

5. On the **Pools** tab, click the **Add** button.

6. Select the network to which you want to apply the DHCP pool, then define an IP range for the pool. You can leave the lease times as default or change them.

7. When you're finished, click **Keep**.
