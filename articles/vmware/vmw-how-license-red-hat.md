# How to bring your own Red Hat licensing

## Overview

UKCloud offers UKCloud for VMware with a variety of operating systems to suit your application requirements.

## Options

In order to make the provision of Red Hat based virtual machines as simple and quickly as possible, UKCloud offer the following options to all customers:

- UKCloud Red Hat licencing and usage billing - One of the options is for UKCloud to provide Red Hat licencing per hour based on your usage per virtual machine. This will be billed per month in addition to the cost of the virtual machine
- Bring your own (BYO) Red hat licencing - For certain organisations that have an existing licencing contract with Red Hat, or wish to licence their Red Hat usage directly, UKCloud are able to offer the option of your organisation using your own licencing and therefore opting out of the automatic Red Hat licencing process offered by UKCloud.

## Process

If you wish to take advantage of your own existing Red Hat licencing or purchase additional licences on your existing agreement for use with UKCloud provisioned virtual machines, then please follow these simple steps:

1. Log in to the [UKCloud Portal](https://portal.ukcloud.com/login).

2. Select **Support**, then **My Calls**.

3. Under **Actions**, select **Raise a new support call**.

    The support form will ask you to state what date you wish to use you own licencing from, and whether you wish your own licencing to affect specific virtual machines, specific VDC's or all of your virtual machines under your organisation.

## Validation

Once the form is submitted, the support team will update our records and once the change has been confirmed with you, your own Red Hat licencing will be utilised and you will no longer be billed by UKCloud for Red Hat licence usage.

> [!NOTE]
> Red Hat may contact you to confirm that you have the correct number of licences in place to cover the number of Red Hat provisioned virtual machines supplied by UKCloud.

## Responsibilities

Once you have completed the form and the actions have been confirmed, your organisation will be responsible for ensuring that there are enough eligible licences to cover the Red Hat virtual machines on the UKCloud platform, and UKCloud will no longer be responsible for any Red Hat licencing commitments for the specified virtual machines under your organisation.
