# How to access edge gateway settings

## Overview

An edge gateway provides access to your environment from the outside world and is possibly the most complex part of the virtual data centre (VDC) because of its high level of functionality. Many tasks involving connectivity to your VDC will involve editing edge gateway settings.

## To access edge gateway settings

# [Using Tenant UI](#tab/tabid-1)

1. In vCloud Director *Virtual Datacenters* dashboard, select the VDC that contains the edge gateway you want to configure.

2. In the left navigation panel, click **Edges**.

# [Using Legacy UI](#tab/tabid-2)

1. In vCloud Director, click the **Administration** tab.

3. Select the **Edge Gateways** tab.
