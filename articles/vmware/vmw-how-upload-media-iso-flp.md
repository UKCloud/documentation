# How to upload ISO or FLP media

## Overview

You may find you need to upload ISO (DVD/CD) or FLP (floppy disk) media to vCloud that have already been provided by UKCloud. These media can then:

- Be consumed by users within your organisation

- Facilitate the creation of VMs from scratch, which can then be saved to your catalog for future deployment

## Uploading media

To upload media to the catalog:

# [Using vCloud Director 8.20](#tab/tabid-1)

1. In vCloud Director, select the **Catalogs** tab.

4. In the *Upload Media & Other* dialog box you can:

    - Paste in a URL for the ISO or FLP media

    - Browse to the ISO or FLP file on your local device and select it (for this to work, you need to have Java JRE available on your device)

5. You can give the media a name and then choose which catalog to put it in.

6. When you're done, click **Upload**.

    During the upload, you'll see a status window. You can carry on with other work while the upload takes place.

7. You can close (and reopen) the window by clicking the **View uploads and downloads** icon.
