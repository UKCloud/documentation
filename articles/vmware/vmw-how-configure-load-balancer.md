# How to configure a load balancer

## Overview

One of the functions of the edge gateway is to act as a basic Layer 3 load balancer, distributing IP traffic to a pool of servers while appearing as a single virtual server. The load balancing methods offered are round-robin, IP hash, URI, HTTP header or least connected.

Bear in mind, however, that the edge gateway load balancer is quite basic. If you need to meet more complex requirements, you'll need provide your own third-party virtual load balancer.

## Configuring a load balancer

To configure a load balancer:

1. In the vCloud Director *Virtual Datacenters* dashboard, select the VDC that contains the edge gateway in which you to configure the load balancer.

2. In the left navigation panel, click **Edges**.

3. Select the edge that you want to configure and click **Configure Services**.

4. Select the **Load Balancer** tab.

5. On the **Global Configuration** tab, enable the **Enabled** option.

6. If you have a syslog server configured, enable the **Enable Logging** option.

    For more information about syslog servers, see [*How to access syslog data for your advanced gateway*](vmw-how-access-syslog-data-adv.md)

7. Click **Save changes**.

### Configuring a pool server

Pool servers are the real servers that will be masked by the load balancer.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you configure the pool of servers, make a list of their IP addresses so that you can populate the pool later in the procedure.

1. Select the **Pools** tab.

2. Click the **+** button.

    ![Add pool button](images/vmw-vcd-load-balancer-btn-add-pool-adv.png)

3. In the *Add Pool* dialog box, enter a **Name** and **Description**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The pool name should not include any spaces.

4. From the **Algorithm** list, select the load balancing algorithm to use.

5. From the **Monitors** list, select the monitors policy.

6. Enable the **Transparent** option if you want IP addresses to be transparent.

7. In the *Members* section, click **+**.

    ![Add member button](images/vmw-vcd-load-balancer-btn-add-member-adv.png)

8. In the *Add Member* dialog box, in the **Name** field, enter the server **Name**, **IP Address**, **Port** and **Weight**. When you're done, click **Keep**.

    ![Add Member dialog box](images/vmw-vcd-load-balancer-add-member-adv.png)

9. Add more pool members as required and when you're done, click **Keep**.

10. To view the status of pool members, click **Show Pool Statistics**.

### Configuring a virtual server

A virtual server masks the pool of real servers and presents a single IP address.

1. Select the **Virtual Servers** tab.

    ![Virtual Servers tab](images/vmw-vcd-adv-edge-tab-load-balancer-servers.png)

2. Click the **+** button.

    ![Add virtual server button](images/vmw-vcd-load-balancer-btn-add-server-adv.png)

3. In the *Add Virtual Server* dialog box, enable the **Enable Virtual Server** option.

4. Enter a **Name** for the virtual server, assign it a virtual **IP Address**, and assign it to the server pool you want to mask. You can also choose which services you want to apply to the virtual server. When you're done, click **Keep**.
