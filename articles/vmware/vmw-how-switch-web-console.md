# How to switch to the vCloud Director Legacy UI

## Overview

For some tasks, you cannot use the Tenant UI; to perform these tasks, you must first switch to the Legacy UI.

Tasks that you cannot perform in the Tenant UI include:

- Uploading ISO and FLP media as a URL

- Viewing vApp template description, including OS password and patch dates

- Changing VDC default storage policy

## Switching to the Legacy UI

1. In the top-right corner of the vCloud Director Tenant UI, click your user name, then select **Legacy UI**.
