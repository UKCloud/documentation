# How to switch to the vCloud Director web console from the tenant portal

## Overview

For some tasks, you cannot use the tenant portal that was introduced in vCloud Director 9.1. To perform these tasks, you must first switch to the web console.

Tasks that you cannot perform in the tenant portal include:

- Managing standard edges (for example, editing firewall and NAT rules)

- Redeploying edges

- Editing vApp network settings

- Uploading ISO or OVF files from a URL

- Copying and moving individual virtual machines (VMs)

- Viewing virtual data centre (VDC) properties, such as metadata

- Creating affinity and anti-affinity rules

## Switching to the vCloud Director web console

1. In the vCloud Director *Virtual Datacenters* dashboard, select the VDC you want to work with.

2. On the *vApps* or *Virtual Machines* page, click **See this page in vCloud Director Web Console**.
