# Naming virtual machines

The current version of ESXi hosts on the UKCloud platform implements stricter restrictions on the characters permitted for virtual machines (VMs), so you should be aware of the following:

When naming VM’s in your infrastructure we would advise not using special characters. 

When creating a new VM, make sure that the name includes only uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric characters and the hyphen (-) character. Using any other special characters will cause deployment to fail.

Virtual machines with strings in square brackets [] in their name might not deploy successfully, because of possible leading spaces added or missing. For example: ‘[username]vmname’ or ‘[username] vmname’ (note 2 spaces prefixed to vmname).

The following VM operations may be impacted when a VM name contain square brackets []:

-	Performing a vMotion, relocate or a clone operation

-	Creating a template, converting a template, or deploying a VM from a template

-	Enabling Fault Tolerance on a virtual machine

-	During a HA event VM failover may not succeed

-	DRS operations (Fully Automated) may not succeed

You must update any existing VMs with names that include other special characters to make sure that they comply with these restrictions. VMs with special characters in their names may go offline if they're moved to an upgraded host.
