# Changes in vCloud Director 9.7

## Overview

After the recent upgrades to vCloud Director 9.7, there are some things you might need to take into consideration.

## Upgrade to advanced edge gateways

vCloud Director 9.7 supports only advanced edge gateways. For more information, see [*How to convert your edge to an advanced gateway*](https://docs.ukcloud.com/articles/vmware/vmw-how-convert-edge.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The conversion process will cause the gateway to redeploy. Therefore, you should schedule the conversion during an outage window.

As part of the upgrades, UKCloud requested that any edge gateways be upgraded before 31st May 2019. UKCloud will convert any remaining standard edge gateways at our convenience.

## Changes to APIs

vCloud Director 9.7 supports vCloud API version 32.0. For information the changes to the vCloud API for this version, see [*vCloud API Schema Differences*](https://code.vmware.com/apis/553/doc/diff/index.html).

vCloud Director 9.7 is the last release of vCloud Director to support vCloud API 20. The 20 version of the API is deprecated in this release and will not be supported in future releases.

## PowerCLI supported versions

If you're using PowerCLI to interact with our vCloud Director instances, the minimum supported version is 11.0.0.
