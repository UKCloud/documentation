# How to create firewall rules

## Overview

vCloud Director provides a fully featured layer 3 firewall to control transit from inside to outside security boundaries, and within the various VDC networks you create.

When you specify networks or IP addresses, you can use:

- An individual IP address
- IP ranges separated by a dash (`-`)
- A CIDR, for example, `192.168.2.0/24`
- The keywords `internal`, `external` or `any`

The steps for creating firewall rules vary depending on what type of edge gateway you're working with:

- [*Creating firewall rules for an advanced gateway*](#creating-firewall-rules-for-an-advanced-gateway)
- [*Creating firewall rules for a standard edge*](#creating-firewall-rules-for-a-standard-edge)

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you convert your edge to an advanced gateway to access the latest vCloud Director functionality. For more information, see [*How to convert your edge to an advanced gateway*](vmw-how-convert-edge.md).

## Creating firewall rules for an advanced gateway

To create a firewall rule on an advanced gateway:

1. In vCloud Director, access the edge gateway settings.

    For more detailed instructions, see [*How to access edge gateway settings*](vmw-how-access-edge.md)

2. Select the **Firewall** tab.

    ![Firewall tab](images/vmw-vcd-adv-edge-tab-firewall.png)

3. Click the **+** button to add a new row to the firewall rules table.

    ![Add firewall button](images/vmw-vcd-adv-edge-firewall-add.png)

4. For the **New Rule**, specify a **Name**.

5. In the **Source** and **Destination** fields, specify the source and destination addresses for the firewall rule.

    - To specify an IP address or range, click **IP** and enter the appropriate **Value**. When you're done, click **Keep**.

    - To specify a group of VMs or IPs, click **+** and select the desired objects. When you're done, click **Keep**.

        ![Select objects dialog box](images/vmw-vcd-adv-edge-firewall-select-objects.png)

    - If you're likely to reuse a group of the same source or destination IP addresses in multiple rules, select the **Grouping Objects** tab and click **+** to create an IP set. You can then select this IP set in the *Select objects* dialog box.

6. In the **Service** field, click **+** and, in the *Add Service* dialog box, specify the **Protocol**, **Source Port** and **Destination Port** for the rule. When you're done, click **Keep**.

    ![Add Service dialog box](images/vmw-vcd-adv-edge-firewall-add-service.png)

7. Select whether the rule is an **Accept** or **Deny** rule.

8. Click **Save changes**.

## Creating firewall rules for a standard edge

> [!NOTE]
> You can only manage advanced gateways in the new vCloud Director 9.1 tenant portal. If you're working with a standard edge gateway, you must first switch to the vCloud Director web console to manage the edge. For more information, see [*How to switch to the vCloud Director web console from the tenant portal*](vmw-how-switch-web-console.md).

To create a firewall rule on a standard edge:

1. In vCloud Director, click the **Administration** tab.

    ![Administration tab in vCloud Director](images/vmw-vcd-tab-admin.png)

    For more detailed instructions, see the [*Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware*](vmw-gs.md)

2. Double-click the virtual data centre (VDC) that you want to work with, or right-click the VDC and select **Open**.

3. Select the **Edge Gateways** tab.

    ![Edge Gateways tab](images/vmw-vcd-tab-edge-gateways.png)

4. Right-click the edge gateway and select **Edge Gateway Services**.

5. Select the **Firewall** tab.

    ![Firewall tab](images/vmw-vcd-tab-firewall-reg.png)

6. Click **Add**.

    ![Add button on the Firewall tab](images/vmw-vcd-btn-add-firewall-reg.png)

7. Give the rule a name and assign a source IP address and source port type. This can be any port or a specific port number.

8. Add a destination IP address and port, then choose which protocol to assign to the rule.

9. Select whether to make the rule an **Allow** or **Deny** rule, and whether to log the network traffic for this particular rule. (Log viewing is currently not available owing to the multi-tenant nature of the environment. We are working to make this feature available in the future.)

    > [!NOTE]
    > With firewall rules, you are allowing packets through from the external network to the public IP address which is subsequently NAT-ed. A common mistake is to create firewall rules from `external` to an internal Org Network IP address or range.

10. When you're finished, click **OK**.

## Example

A common use case for a firewall rule is to allow SSH through from the internet. The following example uses allocated public IP addresses.

When your VDC is provisioned in the:

- Assured OFFICIAL platform, you're assigned five public IP addresses
- Elevated OFFICIAL platform, you're assigned three PSN-P IP addresses

In the examples below, the source is `any` (any IP address within the VDC). The source port is also `any`. The destination is a public IP address and the destination port is `443` for HTTPS.
