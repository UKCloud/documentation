# System Center on the UKCloud platform

System Center is permitted on the UKCloud platform as long as you have your own licensing bought through your Enterprise agreement with Software Assurance.

Licensing for System Center is not provided by UKCloud. Therefore, if you wish to use System Center on the UKCloud platform, you must obtain your own licensing with Software Assurance and ensure you complete the Microsoft Mobility form. This must be posted and approved for use by Microsoft prior to installing System Center on any UKCloud Virtual Machines. Further detail and guidance regarding this process can be found here.

Please note the following limitations apply to System Center:

- If you have System Center Datacentre licensing in place this can be used on up to 10 VMs on the UKCloud platform

- If you have a Standard license this covers 2 VMs on the UKCloud platform

- Configuration Manager Console SAL and EndPoint protection cannot be used on our platform as these are only available for laptops and desktops as per Microsoft's terms

- To license this software you need to license based on either the number of cores or processors on a host server. Please contact UKCloud via <products@ukcloud.com> to discuss this prior to the purchase of any licensing or completion of a Mobility form
