# How to access Red Hat update servers

## Overview

UKCloud has implemented a Red Hat Update Infrastructure (RHUI) to provide automatic updates to our Red Hat customers in the Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL security domains. The benefits over the existing system are the reliable availability of patch updates and Red Hat approved OS templates.

Before you attempt to establish a connection to RHUI, you need to make sure your virtual machines (VMs) can communicate with the RHUI which exists outside of your cloud organisation. This may involve editing the NAT and firewall settings within your edge gateway to allow traffic to traverse into your virtual data centre (VDC). For how to do this, see the articles for creating [NAT](vmw-how-create-nat-rules.md) and [firewall](vmw-how-create-firewall-rules.md) rules.

## New Red Hat VM templates

Certain Red Hat templates within the public catalog within vCloud Director are automatically configured to receive updates from UKCloud's RHUI. The templates are:

- **RHEL6.6** - UKCloud-RHEL6.6-x86_64-RHUI-Template

- **RHEL7.1** - UKCloud-RHEL7.1-x86_64-RHUI-Template

These templates have the following properties:

- You can find the default root password in the VM Properties Description field (you can set the password using Guest Customization)

- Red Hat Update Infrastructure enabled for standard packages

- VMware Tools / Guest Customization enabled

- 32GB disk space / 1 x vCPU / 2GB ram (default, adjust as required)

You can adjust the VM properties as required and you'll be billed as per the standard VM sizes as described in the UKCloud for VMware Service Definition. You will not be billed on additional storage until you reach the 60GB of provisioned disk space.

## Old Red Hat VM templates

If you have already deployed a Red Hat VM using the old templates, you can configure it to access the RHUI by following this guide:

[How to install Red Hat Update Infrastructure (RHUI) on an existing virtual machine](vmw-how-install-rhui-vm.md)

## Additional resources

High Availability (HA) and Extended Update Support (EUS) are premium Red Hat services, you'll need to notify UKCloud for access to these repositories or will need to bring your own licenses to support these additional services. If required, we can provide access to additional repositories such as Scalable File System, Load Balancer or Resilient Storage. To access these services, please raise a request via the My Calls section in the UKCloud Portal and it will be uploaded to your private catalog.
