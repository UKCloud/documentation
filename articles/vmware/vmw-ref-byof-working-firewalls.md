# Bring Your Own Firewall - Known working and non-working firewalls

## Introduction

The UKCloud Bring Your Own Firewall service option enables you to install your own virtual firewall within your compute environment instead of using the vCNS device we provide as standard. This enables you to use technology with which you are already familiar and which offers the exact functionality that meets your requirements.

While we provide you with a vDC that enables you to use whichever firewall technology you want and do not impose any specific restrictions, this guide aims to provide information about technology that is known to work or not work on our platform.

By requesting the Bring Your Own Firewall option, you accept that you are entirely responsible for sourcing, licensing, installing, configuring and maintaining your firewall. UKCloud will not be able to offer any support for issues caused by the use of a non-standard firewall.

## Known working firewalls

The following firewall technology has been successfully deployed and configured on the UKCloud platform.

### pfSense firewalls

- pfSense v2.2.4 i386

- pfSense v2.3.1 i386

- pfSense v2.3.1 amd64

### Palo Alto firewalls

- Palo Alto VM300 running PanOS 7.01

- Cisco Cloud Services Router 1000v (Cisco CSR1000v)

    While CSR1000v version 3.16 is supported in both vSphere and vCloud Director deployments, there is a compatibility issue with OVF templates built on legacy hardware configurations (hardware version 7).

    To ensure that your CSR1000v router operates correctly, ensure that your OVF template is built on the most recent hardware version (9 or above).

## Known non-working firewalls

The following firewall technology is known to not work with the UKCloud platform.

### Cisco ASAv

This product is not supported in vCloud Director and therefore will not work on the UKCloud platform.
