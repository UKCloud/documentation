# Advanced networking options for UKCloud for VMware

## Overview

UKCloud for VMware provides additional distributed networking functionality as part of its Advanced and Enterprise Networking bundles (additional charges apply). These distributed networking features enable you to more easily build advanced networking to improve the performance of traffic within your VDC.

UKCloud for VMware's advanced distributed networking features include:

- **Distributed Firewall (DFW)** - enables creation of firewall rules at the virtual machine (VM) level as well as at the edge gateway, providing more flexibility in network design.

    For more information, see [*How to configure a Distributed Firewall*](vmw-how-configure-distributed-firewall.md).

- **Distributed Logical Router (DLR)** - improves the performance of traffic routed between VMs within a VDC (East-West traffic), without the need to route traffic back through the edge gateway.

    For more information, see [*How to configure a Distributed Logical Router*](vmw-how-configure-distributed-logical-router.md).

- **L2 VPN** - stretches your network across two edge gateways in different sites, enabling you to seamlessly move workloads between sites.

    For more information, see [*How to configure a Layer 2 VPN*](vmw-how-configure-l2-vpn.md).
