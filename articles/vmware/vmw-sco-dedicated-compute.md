# Dedicated Compute Service Scope

## About this document

This document is for customers considering purchasing our Dedicated Compute service.

It describes the boundaries of the service, along with the division of responsibilities between UKCloud and the customer to facilitate the changes required.

## About Dedicated Compute

Dedicated Compute enables you to have a reserved, single-tenanted section of our cloud, where the physical CPU and RAM allocations are known.

This service is designed for customers who:

- Are looking to run abnormal sized VMs - such as those larger than our standard T-shirt sizes
- Looking to meet specific software licensing requirements
- Have an increased security requirement that can be met by Dedicated Compute infrastructure

## Default setup

We deliver Dedicated Compute by providing you with dedicated physical blades on which you control resource allocation.

The initial Dedicated Compute purchase is a starter pack consisting of two physical blades. The standard blade consists of 20 physical cores (40 hyper-threaded cores) and 300Â GiB of RAM.

You can then scale your estate by purchasing expansion packs. After nine expansion packs, you must buy another starter pack.

You choose between Tier 1 or Tier 2 storage for your VMs, both of which can include a backup service. Full details of service options and pricing are given in the Service Definition.

The storage pool isn't a dedicated hardware resource: it is drawn from our Cloud Storage solutions.

These resources are grouped in a private virtual data centre (pVDC) which is available only to the individual Dedicated Compute customer.

## Resilience and resource reservations

We operate at least N+1 for hardware resilience on our Dedicated Compute service. However, we recommend sizing your resilience according to your workload profile.

We will reserve at least one physical blade's worth of resources from your allocation to ensure that, in the event of a hardware failure, the service can continue to run and support your workload.

During a failure scenario, VMs will be restarted on surviving hosts within the Dedicated Compute cluster. UKCloud is not responsible for any performance degradation of VMs in the Dedicated Compute cluster caused during a failure scenario due to over contention in the remaining hosts.

The table below shows the configuration, the resources available to a customer, the number of physical blades in the configuration, and the UKCloud resources reserved to run it.

&nbsp; | Customer available resources | Physical blades | Resource reservation
------|------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------
**Starter pack** | 20 cores, 300 GiB RAM | 2 | 50% (20 cores, 300 GiB RAM)
**Starter pack + 1 expansion pack** | 40 cores, 600 GiB RAM | 3 | 33% (20 cores, 300 GiB RAM)
**Starter pack + 2 expansion packs** | 60 cores, 900 GiB RAM | 4 | 25% (20 cores, 300 GiB RAM)

## Resource utilisation

To improve performance, Dedicated Compute uses all physical resources available in the installation and balances the load across them, without consuming the reserved capacity mentioned above.

This means that in general operation within the starter pack, there is a 50% utilisation of both physical blades:

However, you can create VMs of any size and shape you require, up to the maximum size of the physical capacity of one blade - 20 physical cores (40 vCPU) and 300 GiB RAM.

A VM cannot span across physical blades so, if you create a VM larger than 50% of the blade capacity, the Dedicated Compute installation may carry more of the contingency capacity of one physical blade than of the others:

You can over-contend the resources on your Dedicated Compute as you see fit.

## Deployment options

There are two deployment options for Dedicated Compute:

- **UKCloud-defined** - You select a workload type for your VDC based on UKCloud's Enterprise Compute Cloud VM types (ESSENTIAL, POWER or PRIORITY). Any VMs will inherit the characteristics and reservation levels of that service when deployed.

- **Customer-defined** - You can set reservation levels on a per-VM basis.

## Platform management

Dedicated Compute is managed in the same way as our other cloud services, using vCloud Director, the UKCloud Portal, and APIs associated with both.

The Dedicated Compute service will be maintained to the same software patch revisions as our main platform.

It's not currently possible to see the level of provisioned/utilised resources against the Dedicated Compute service on the UKCloud Portal. (This is a development item on the UKCloud Portal roadmap.) In the meantime, we can provide this information on request.

## Service provisioning

You can request Dedicated Compute via your account manager or using the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal.

The minimum commitment period to the service is 90 days. The notice period is 90 days.

On receipt of all relevant information, we will deploy the service within 10 working days for standard configurations.

## Customer responsibilities

You need to be aware of the following customer responsibilities relating to deployment of, configuration of and migration into the Dedicated Compute service, which are in addition to the usual responsibilities placed on customers of our UKCloud for VMware service:

- Creating VMs in the new environment

- Migrating VMs from existing environments by cloning and copying turned-off VMs, or by moving turned-off vApps to the new environment

- Ensuring you have the right licensing in place for the applications in use in your Dedicated Compute environment

- If you select the customer-defined deployment option, you must manage your own reservation levels

- It is your responsibility to purchase enough Dedicated Compute modules to ensure that there is enough resource available to your VMs in the event that one or more hosts fail. If you need any help ensuring you have enough resource in your Dedicated Compute cluster, contact your Cloud Architect.
