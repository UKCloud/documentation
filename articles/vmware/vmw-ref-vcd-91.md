# Upgrade to vCloud Director 9.1

## Introduction

This guide outlines the improvements UKCloud's upgrade to vCloud Director 9.1 will deliver to UKCloud for VMware.

## vCloud Director 9.1 new features

vCloud Director 9.1 provides the following new features:

- Enhanced HTML-5 tenant portal, including:

  - Creation and configuration of networks consolidated in a single view
  - New metrics dashboard provides functionality previously available only via API
  - Streamlined workflows for creating vApps and VMs

    For more information about the vCloud Director tenant portal, see the [*vCloud Director Tenant Portal Guide*](https://docs.vmware.com/en/vCloud-Director/9.1/com.vmware.vcloud.tenantportal.doc/GUID-74C9E10D-9197-43B0-B469-126FFBCB5121.html).

- Standalone VMRC improves access to VM consoles

For a full list of new features in vCloud Director 9.1, see the [*What's New with VMware vCloud Director 9.1*](https://blogs.vmware.com/vcloud/files/2018/03/vcd91newfeatureswp.pdf) white paper.

## Changes to APIs

For information about the changes to the vCloud API used by vCloud Director 9.1, see the [*vCloud API Schema Differences*](https://code.vmware.com/apis/287/vcloud#/doc/diff/index.html) document.

You should be aware of the following end-of-life and end-of-support warnings for older vCloud API versions in vCloud Director 9.1:

- vCloud Director 9.1 no longer supports vCloud API versions 1.5 and 5.1. These API versions were deprecated in a previous release.
- vCloud Director 9.1 is the last release of vCloud Director to support any vCloud API versions earlier than 20.0. Those API versions are deprecated in this release and will not be supported in future releases.

## Known issues

You can only manage advanced gateways in the new vCloud Director 9.1 tenant portal. If you have not yet converted your edge to an advanced gateway, you must first switch to the vCloud Director web console to manage the edge.  For more information about converting your edge to an advanced gateway, see [*How to convert your edge to an advanced gateway*](vmw-how-convert-edge.md). For more information about switching to the web console, see [*How to switch to the vCloud Director web console from the tenant portal*](vmw-how-switch-web-console.md). 

For a list of other known issues with vCloud Director 9.1, see the [*vCloud Director 9.1 for Service Providers Release Notes*](https://docs.vmware.com/en/vCloud-Director/9.1/rn/rel_notes_vcloud_director_91.html#knownissues).
