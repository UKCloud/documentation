# Understanding UKCloud's Identity & Access Management API

UKCloud's Identity & Access Management API (IDAM) enables you to manage user access to products within your account. Adding a user to a group changes which permissions they have.

Full documentation for the IDAM API is available on [SwaggerHub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/ukcloud/idam-service).
