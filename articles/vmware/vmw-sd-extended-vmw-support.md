# On-Premises VMware Extended Support Service Definition

## What is On-Premises VMware Extended Support?

Our On-Premises VMware Extended Support (VMware Extended Support) service provides ongoing Level 1 and Level 2 support for VMware estates where vSphere licences are operating on currently unsupported versions such as v5.5 and v6.0.

This service provides organisations with additional time to plan upgrades to supported levels of VMware or migrations onto new platforms or services, such as UKCloud's range of public and private clouds operating at OFFICIAL and above.

This service is not intended as a permanent solution for providing these levels of VMware support, as the lack of patches and vulnerability fixes will increase the risk factor for cyber-attack and vulnerability.

UKCloud provides support through our award-winning Service Desk, where our 10 years of operating a significant VMware estate has developed depth and breadth in our VMware skills and capabilities.

Support is provided on the basis of all reasonable endeavours. It's important to note that any issues beyond Level 2 cannot be progressed any further, as VMware will not provide any support until the licences have been upgraded to a supported level.

## What the service can help you achieve

- **Support.** UKCloud provides Level 1 and Level 2 support for the vSphere licences on v5.5 and above that are no longer supported by VMware.

- **Reduce risk.** UKCloud's significant experience and capabilities in VMware reduce the risk in continuing to operate out of support platforms.

- **Confidence.** Have greater confidence that the existing platform will maintain stability whilst longer term plans for workload migration are achieved.

- **Pay per VM.** Our costs are associated with your VM count so as services move off your older platform your extended support cost naturally declines.

In addition, UKCloud can assist in numerous ways to either support migration away from older platforms or provide experienced professionals to support your upgrade plans.

## Comsumption and pricing

VMware Extended Support is calculated based on your usage of the VMware environment. This is calculated by the VMware Usage Meter, which sits alongside each vCenter and is configured to email a usage report to VMware each month.

Pricing starts from £10 per VM per month for a VM with 8GB allocated.

A minimum charge of £1,000 per month applies.

For full details of our Commitment Discount, refer to the *Discounts and purchase schemes* section of the [UKCloud Pricing Guide](https://ukcloud.com/pricing-guide). No other forms of discount are applicable to this service.

## Accreditation and information assurance

The security of our platform is our number one priority. We've always been committed to adhering to exacting standards, frameworks and best practice. Everything we do is subject to regular independent validation by government accreditors, sector auditors and management system assessors. Details are available on the [UKCloud website](https://ukcloud.com/governance/).

## An SLA you can trust

We understand that enterprise workloads need a dependable service that underpins the reliability of the application to users and other systems, which is why we offer one of the best SLAs on G-Cloud. For full details on the service SLA, see the [SLA definition](https://docs.ukcloud.com/articles/other/other-ref-sla-definition.html).

## The small print

Consumption is estimated at the outset and calculated for a 6- or 12-month initial period. Subsequent periods can be for 6 or 12 months.

You must deploy the VMware Usage Meter against the vCenter in the environment and set up monthly reporting via automated email. This provides accurate consumption data on a month-to-month basis. Support is provided specifically to the VMware environment and does not extend to integrations to other services.

For full terms and conditions, including onboarding and responsibilities, refer to the [Terms and Conditions documents](../other/other-ref-terms-and-conditions.md).
