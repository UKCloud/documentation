# VMware Licence Service Service Definition

## What is the VMware Licence Service?

VMware Licence Service (VLS) complements our Managed IT Operations service, by offering a managed VMware service ideally suited to customers who:

- Are planning, or have already started, a multi-cloud strategy, where the operational costs associated with workloads can seamlessly move to the cloud provider as workloads migrate.

- Want to upgrade their on-premises VMware estate, with NSX, vSAN, SRM, vROps, Network Insight and Horizon, to enhance performance, security and resource allocation to enable the seamless migration to the cloud. VLS enables these enhancements for short deployment periods in the most cost-effective way.

- Want to purchase VMware Workspace ONE - details are explained in the [*UKCloud VMware Workspace ONE VMware License Service (VLS) Service Scope*](vmw-sco-vls-ws1.md).

- Want to migrate to a full rental/consumption-based OPEX model rather than a fixed-cost (CAPEX-centric) model on either an annual or monthly basis.

- Want the flexibility to accommodate rapid changes in virtualised and end-user demand within their organisation, especially given the current variable demands on secure end-user capabilities.

- Are now ready, as part of their strategic cloud direction, to allow third-party expertise to provide enhanced confidence in the health of the IT estate, with none of the traditionally associated internal resource effort.

- Are looking for VMware support from UK-based, security cleared, UK nationals, ensuring data integrity and compliance even in the most challenging of environments.

## What the service can help you achieve

- **Only pay for what you use.** Your consumption is based on the output reporting of the VMware Usage Meter, which directly relates to your actual operational elements. No longer pay for licences sitting on shelves or deployed into powered-off servers.

- **Operational excellence.** UKCloud's highly experienced Service Delivery team is available to provide advise and guidance. Under VLS, the environment is enhanced through the provision of NSX and vRLI, in addition to the recommended deployment of VMware Skyline.

- **Scalability.** VMware metered licensing is entirely flexible, so can scale up and down as your needs change.

- **Flexibility.** An easier and more cost-effective method for adopting new VMware technologies. Enhanced features or capabilities can be utilised with just a small monthly increase in consumption reporting.

- **Financial efficiency.** Choice of annual or monthly payments depending on your specific circumstances or organisation requirements, with incremental discounts delivered for annual payment.

## Why UKCloud for VLS?

- **A UK company.** UKCloud owns and operates a UK-sovereign, industry-leading, multi-cloud platform, located within the Government's Crown Campus.

- **VMware certified specialist.** UKCloud is the largest cloud provider in the UK, specialising in the delivery of VMware-based cloud services solely to UK government, health, education and the third sector.

- **Unique service proposition.** VLS was exclusively developed in the UK by VMware and UKCloud to create a key building block for enabling migration to multi-cloud (a mix of true public cloud and secure private cloud, spanning on-premises, Crown Campus and hyperscaler).

- **Cloud migration.** Delivered faster and safer with UKCloud's wide portfolio of Cloud Services, Professional Services and Managed Services.

- **UK-based support.** Dedicated 24/7 UK telephone and ticket support with access to UKCloud's technical experts. First- and second-line support is provided from the award-winning UKCloud service desk, with additional support provided by VMware.

- **Service Delivery Manager.** Every VLS customer is designated a Service Delivery Manager (SDM) for ongoing support, quarterly performance reporting and active service monitoring.

## Licence eligibility

- **Includes:**

  - vSphere, vROps, vSAN, NSX, SRM, Workspace ONE and Horizon

  - All other licences that are captured in the Usage Meter

- **Excludes:**

  - Avi Networks, Velocloud, Carbon Black, Pivotal (until these appear on the VCPP product guide)

## VLS managed service elements

There are several options for how to deploy VLS, depending on the breadth of the managed service options the customer has selected and the extent to which UKCloud Professional Services are deployed to support the setup and transition into operation.

The following are the key steps of a typical deployment completed by UKCloud:

- **Workload analysis.** Current usage for licence types, deployment quantities, VM and vRAM allocations are identified and assessed. Recommendations are made to tune as necessary and the outcome is then used to baseline future estimated consumption.

- **Usage Meter.** Deployment and setup, and, if sufficiently in advance, data is used to validate estimated consumption. Automated emails are configured for reporting consumption to UKCloud. Horizon currently requires manual reporting.

- **VCPP licence keys.** New licence keys are applied to all VMware products covered under VLS. UKCloud will provide the licence keys at the correct operating software level for the existing environment.

- **Software/patching levels.** Software/patch updates will be provided by UKCloud as required to ensure the ongoing support of the environment. Schedules will be agreed through the Service Delivery team.

- **Service operations.** The customer will be set up on the UKCloud Portal. Incidents will either be notified by the customer or reporting will be automated through Managed Monitoring as a Service, if selected.

- **Service delivery management.** The assigned SDM will be available to support any incidents that occur. A quarterly report/meeting will ensure continuity on all aspects. Topics covered will include:

  - Service incidents

  - Billing/consumption reporting

  - Capacity and future planning

  - Support/patch levels

  - Environment/performance enhancements

  - Migration strategy/next steps
