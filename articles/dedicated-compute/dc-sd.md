# UKCloud Dedicated Compute v2 Service Definition

## What is UKCloud Dedicated Compute v2?

Dedicated Compute v2 is a flexible solution designed for when you need guaranteed performance. This service delivers exceptional performance through dedicated compute hosts and meets your security obligations by addressing compliance and regulatory requirements through physical separation of workloads.

Hosts are assigned for your sole use and are enabled for granular configuration to meet your workload requirements. Dedicated Compute v2 utilises our public VMware storage, providing on-demand flexibility, with either Tier 1 or Tier 2 options available.

## What the service can help you achieve

- **Workload isolation.** Designed for the exclusive use of each customer, providing the highest levels of separation and isolation from other customers within a trusted community.

- **Predictable performance and flexible configuration.** Guaranteed performance - manage custom workloads, with full-control of VM sizing, CPU and RAM allocations.

- **Use your existing software licenses.** Utilise existing licences on the UKCloud platform, including Microsoft licences, and other licences that are bound to the host (some restrictions apply such as Microsoft Server licences).

- **Prove the concept.** Your own dedicated cloud infrastructure without the long-term commitment.

- **Meets compliance and regulatory requirements.** The UKCloud platform is regularly CHECK-tested and undergoes regular independent assessments to ensure data security.

- **Automation.** Delivered as a cloud service through high levels of automation, enabling self-service via the UKCloud Portal.
