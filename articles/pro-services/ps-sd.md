# UKCloud Professional Services Service Definition

## What are UKCloud Professional Services?

UKCloud's Professional Services are designed to provide a clear path to true cloud value, no matter where your organisation is on the journey to cloud migration and adoption. We provide expert, agnostic, multi-cloud advice through a structured, modular approach. Each stage is supported by an outcome-focused workflow that delivers tailored, high value output, enabling organisations to adopt and leverage cloud with confidence.

Our four services include Strategy & Assessment, Migration, Optimisation and Transformation and can be tailored to suit your requirements.

## What the service can help you achieve

- **Strategy & Assessment service.** Helps you develop an accurate understanding of as-is and potential-to-be architectures with detailed TCOs, cloud candidacy assessments and a thorough business case, which is then summarised into a documented vision and strategy to inform stakeholders and the subsequent implementation.

- **Migration service.** Migrate workloads to your chosen cloud platform(s). We'll interview key business and technical stakeholders and deploy tools in your infrastructure to ensure we understand your applications and how they interact with each other. You can then migrate workloads in the right order, sized appropriately to benefit from cloud features such as utility billing.

- **Optimisation service.** Reduce operational costs and improve efficiency by utilising different cloud features and adopting new deployment models. UKCloud consultants will undertake a commercial and technical assessment of your cloud environment, then develop and execute work packages that deliver greater value from your cloud deployment.

- **Transformation service.** DevOps, Containerisation and Infrastructure-as-Code require a radically different approach to application development and deployment. This service provides the expertise to ensure your project goes smoothly and your team are ready to adopt new ways of working.

## Typical methodology

Most organisations don't require the full methodology outlined below; each stage can be purchased as a discrete statement of work and different packages can be mixed and matched.

Our professional services are based on a daily rate card. Full pricing is available in the [UKCloud Pricing Guide](https://ukcloud.com/pricing-guide).

The security of your data is our number one priority. We've always been committed to adhering to exacting standards, frameworks and best practice.

## Why UKCloud?

UKCloud is dedicated to the digital transformation of our nation's public services through our flexible, secure and cost-effective multi-cloud platform and the expertise of our people and partners. We believe that diversity of technology drives value and innovation and so we bring together different cloud technologies, with different deployment models spanning on-premises (private cloud), on-campus (Government's Crown Campus) and off-campus global public cloud services. This enables you to choose the right cloud for creating new workloads or migrating or replacing existing applications to the cloud with specialist SaaS solutions.
