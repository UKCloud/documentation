> [!NOTE]
> Although UKCloud is responsible for checking the integrity of SQL backups from a pass/fail/error monitoring perspective, the customer is ultimately responsible for verifying the validity of their backups. UKCloud strongly suggests the customer routinely recovers their database to a secondary instance and connects a copy of their application to verify it operates as expected. **As UKCloud has no understanding of a customer's application, backup data validation sits outside of the scope of this service.**
