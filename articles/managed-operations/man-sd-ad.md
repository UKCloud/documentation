# Managed Active Directory Support Service Definition

## What is Managed Active Directory Support?

Our Managed Active Directory (AD) Support service aims to remove the day-to-day burden of having to ensure your Active Directory services and supporting Windows servers are stable, secure and available.

Active Directory provides the backbone for centralised management and control of authentication and authorisation for users and computers in a Windows domain type network, assigning and enforcing security policies for all computers and installing or updating software.

Organisations often struggle to find or fund the resources required to ensure the ongoing health and availability of their Active Directory services. With UKCloud's Managed AD Support service, we provide you with full 24/7 monitoring and support for your Active Directory services and supporting Windows servers across your multi-cloud estate, be it on-premises, on our cloud, or on a cloud deployment elsewhere. This level of monitoring and support, when coupled with pro-active Windows patching, provides you with the confidence that your AD services are operating effectively, enabling you to focus on your business outcomes
.

## Pricing and packaging

Managed Active Directory Support pricing can be as low as £445 per month. Full pricing with all options is available in the [UKCloud Pricing Guide](https://ukcloud.com/pricing-guide).

## Accreditation and information assurance

The security of our platform is our number one priority. We've always been committed to adhering to exacting standards, frameworks and best practice. Everything we do is subject to regular independent validation by government accreditors, sector auditors and management system assessors. Details are available on the [UKCloud website](https://ukcloud.com/governance/).

## Connectivity options

UKCloud provides one of the best-connected cloud platforms for the UK public sector. We enable access to our secure platform by DDoS-protected internet, PSN, Janet, HSCN, MCN and your own leased lines via our HybridConnect or CrownConnect services. The full range of flexible connectivity options is detailed in the [UKCloud Pricing Guide](https://ukcloud.com/pricing-guide).

## An SLA you can trust

We understand that enterprise workloads need a dependable service that underpins the reliability of the application to users and other systems, which is why we offer one of the best SLAs on G-Cloud. As the SLA varies based on the chosen cloud technology, you can find full details on each service's SLA, including measurements and service credits, in the [*SLA definition*](../other/other-ref-sla-definition.md).

## The small print

A minimum term of twelve months applies to the Account Management fee and any associated (Active Directory Forest and Windows Domain Controller Server) Support fees. Any additional Active Directory Forests or Windows Domain Controller Servers will automatically initiate a new 12-month Account Management term and 12-month term for the new additional Active Directory Forest or Windows Domain Controller Server. That is, the Account Management fee shall always run in parallel with the most current Support fee term. Should early termination be invoked, the customer shall be liable for the remaining balance of the term (both Account Management and Support fee). For example, if a customer's spend is £1,000 per month and they terminate at month nine, they are liable for the remaining three months/£3,000 in full and shall pay within 30 days of invoice.

For full terms and conditions including onboarding and responsibilities, refer to the [*Terms and conditions documents*](../other/other-ref-terms-and-conditions.md).
