# Extended Network Support from UKCloud Service Definition

## What is Extended Network Support from UKCloud?

The Extended Network Support from UKCloud service reduces the burden customers traditionally must consider in supporting their virtual network infrastructure, to enable the reliable and stable connectivity for their solution.

As a natural extension of the Managed IT Operations portfolio of services, our Extended Network Support from UKCloud enables you to choose from an extensive list of officially supported network appliances. UKCloud undertakes the initial deployment (or assumes ownership of valid existing networks) and configuration of the various elements of your virtual network, along with the ongoing monitoring and support. This enables you to focus on your applications and business outcomes rather than worry about your connectivity uptime.

## What the service can help you achieve

- Reduce operational tasks

- Reduce effort on tasks such as network appliance and VLAN deployment, configuration, patching and rebooting

- Concentrate on creating and managing applications and solutions rather than managing virtual infrastructure

- Help increase service uptime through proactive monitoring and incident response

## Product options

The service is designed to be flexible and allows you to choose from the options below to match your requirements:

- Initial deployment and configuration of VLANs

- Initial deployment of UKCloud approved virtual network appliances (for example, NSX Edge, Load Balancers, Firewalls, VPN endpoints)

- Ongoing support of UKCloud deployed and configured VLANs and virtual network appliances

Note that this service is in addition to the provision and cost of any IaaS compute or applicable software licence/support charges (for example, NSX Edge, Octavia Load Balancer and Azure VPN)

## Pricing and packaging

Extended Network Support pricing can be as low as £100 per month for a supported VLAN. Full pricing with all options including licensing and connectivity is available in the [UKCloud Pricing Guide](https://ukcloud.com/pricing-guide).

## Accreditation and information assurance

The security of our platform is our number one priority. We've always been committed to adhering to exacting standards, frameworks and best practice. Everything we do is subject to regular independent validation by government accreditors, sector auditors and management system assessors. Details are available on the [UKCloud website](https://ukcloud.com/governance/).

## Connectivity options

UKCloud provides one of the best-connected cloud platforms for the UK public sector. We enable access to our secure platform by DDoS-protected internet, PSN, Janet, HSCN, MCN and your own leased lines via our HybridConnect or CrownConnect services. The full range of flexible connectivity options is detailed in the [UKCloud Pricing Guide](https://ukcloud.com/pricing-guide).

## An SLA you can trust

We understand that enterprise workloads need a dependable service that underpins the reliability of the application to users and other systems, which is why we offer one of the best SLAs on G-Cloud. As the SLA varies based on the chosen cloud technology, you can find full details on each service's SLA, including measurements and service credits, in the [*SLA definition*](../other/other-ref-sla-definition.md).

## The small print

A minimum term of three months applies to this service. Any additional VLANs or Network Assets will automatically initiate a 3-month term for the new additional VLAN or Network Asset. Should early termination be invoked, the customer shall be liable for the remaining balance of the term. For example, if a customer's spend is £1,000 per month and they terminate at month two, they are liable for the remaining one month/£1,000 in full and shall pay within 30 days of invoice.

For full terms and conditions including onboarding and responsibilities, refer to the [*Terms and conditions documents*](../other/other-ref-terms-and-conditions.md).

## Why UKCloud?
