# Managed SQL Server Service Definition

## What is Managed SQL Server?

Our Managed SQL Server service aims to remove the day-to-day burden of having to ensure your SQL servers are stable, secure and available.

SQL servers provide the backbone for customer facing solutions but deliver no direct value on their own. Organisations that operate a limited, or sometimes non-existent, DBA team are often faced with the difficult decision to either focus on the delivery of business value projects or spend time responding to production issues, or simply 'keeping the lights on'.

With UKCloud's Managed SQL Server service, we provide you with full 24/7 monitoring and support for your SQL servers across your multi-cloud estate, be it on-premises, on our cloud or on a cloud deployment elsewhere. This level of monitoring and support, when coupled with SQL tuning and proactive SQL patching, provides you with the confidence that your SQL services are operating effectively, enabling you to focus on your business outcomes.

We see our Managed SQL Server service as being the perfect blend of having the flexibility of a bespoke SQL server, with all the operation and support efficiencies of Database as a Service (DBaaS).

## What the service can help you achieve

- **Do more.** Free your technical resources to focus on business value projects.

- **Reduce complexity.** A single contract to support your SQL footprint across any cloud.

- **Save money.** Reduce your operating costs by outsourcing the bulk of your DBA function.

- **Peace of mind.** Protect your important data with our built-in backup service.

- **Virtually grow your team.** Leverage the skills and experience of an entire team of SQL experts.

- **Understand your costs.** Our costs are fixed so you don't have to worry about deciphering and understanding SFIA day rates.

- **Remove your pain.** Move towards consuming databases as a commodity service.

## Pricing and packaging

Managed SQL Server pricing can be as low as £494 per SQL instance per month. Full pricing with all options is available in the [UKCloud Pricing Guide](https://ukcloud.com/pricing-guide).

## Accreditation and information assurance

The security of our platform is our number one priority. We've always been committed to adhering to exacting standards, frameworks and best practice. Everything we do is subject to regular independent validation by government accreditors, sector auditors and management system assessors. Details are available on the [UKCloud website](https://ukcloud.com/governance/).

## Connectivity options

UKCloud provides one of the best-connected cloud platforms for the UK public sector. We enable access to our secure platform by DDoS-protected internet, PSN, Janet, HSCN, MCN and your own leased lines via our HybridConnect or CrownConnect services. The full range of flexible connectivity options is detailed in the [UKCloud Pricing Guide](https://ukcloud.com/pricing-guide).

## An SLA you can trust

We understand that enterprise workloads need a dependable service that underpins the reliability of the application to users and other systems, which is why we offer one of the best SLAs on G-Cloud. As the SLA varies based on the chosen cloud technology, you can find full details on each service's SLA, including measurements and service credits, in the [*SLA definition*](../other/other-ref-sla-definition.md).

## The small print

A minimum term of twelve months applies to the Account Management fee and SQL Instance Support fees. Any additional SQL Instances will automatically initiate a new 12-month Account Management term and 12-month term for the new additional SQL Instance. That is, the Account Management fee shall always run in parallel with the most current Support Fee term. Should early termination be invoked, the customer shall be liable for the remaining balance of the term (both Account Management and Support fee). For example, if a customer's spend is £1,000 per month and they terminate at month nine, they are liable for the remaining three months/£3,000 in full and shall pay within 30 days of invoice.

For full terms and conditions including onboarding and responsibilities, refer to the [*Terms and conditions documents*](../other/other-ref-terms-and-conditions.md).

## Why UKCloud?

This enables you to choose the right cloud for creating new workloads or migrating or replacing existing applications to the cloud with specialist SaaS solutions.
