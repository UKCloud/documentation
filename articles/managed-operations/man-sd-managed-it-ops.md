# Managed IT Operations Service Definition

## What is Managed IT Operations?

As customer solutions start to expand beyond their own data centres into embracing the benefits obtained through multi-cloud, managing basic IT hygiene tasks, coupled with generating accurate, trusted monitoring across disparate technology stacks and locations, becomes highly complex and resource intensive. Managed IT Operations helps to reduce the non-value add challenges of managing your compute assets, whilst increasing your overall level of trust and confidence in the true health of your entire multi-cloud estate.

This service provides you with the building blocks to utilise essential operational delivery services. Examples include:

- Monitor the availability of your cloud services as well as your existing physical and virtual infrastructure, enabling quick reaction to customer affecting service disruptions

- Hook into virtual resource metrics (CPU, disk, memory) and highlight performance trends, helping you to rightsize your resources to meet the requirements of your applications

- Provision of core OS patches, providing confidence in the health of your IT estate with none of the traditionally associated resource effort

## What the service can help you achieve

- Incorporate, consolidate, and extend your current monitoring platforms, and any new requirements, into a single, as a service, solution

- Gain a reliable and trusted view of the health of your entire IT infrastructure

- Monitor any device, from anywhere, via the internet or the various community networks UKCloud supports

- Concentrate on creating and managing applications that increase business value rather than managing virtual infrastructure

- Reduce the number of 'false-positive' alerts and associated out of hours call-outs, utilising UKCloud's 24/7 Network Operations Centre (NOC) as the initial responder to events, only escalating those which genuinely need further investigation and attention

- Increase the uptime of your IT estate through faster identification, triage and alert escalations

## Product options

This service is designed to be flexible and allows you to mix and match from a range of pre-defined options and change them when required. The elements that make up this service consist of the following:

![Managed IT Operations product options](images/man-sd-managed-it-ops.png)

- **Managed Monitoring as a Service** *(mandatory)* The foundation of the Managed IT Operations portfolio of services. We become your first line of support, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, receiving and reacting to any abnormal events or alerts across your IT estate, leveraging the power of AIOps to reduce the amount of noise you traditionally had to filter through, enabling you to focus on the critical events that really matter.

- **Patching as a Service** *(optional add-on)* Provides routine OS patch management for compute instances deployed across UKCloud's multi-cloud. It helps you accelerate business value by removing the burden of basic OS hygiene, letting you focus your attention above the operating system.

- **Anti-Virus as a Service** *(optional add-on)* Provides you with the confidence that your environments are protected from the dangers of viruses and malware, all without the usual headaches associated with the deployment, management, and operation of an antivirus solution.

## Pricing and packaging

Managed IT Operations pricing can be as low as Â£12.50 per month for a customer endpoint device. Full pricing with all options is available in the [UKCloud Pricing Guide](https://ukcloud.com/pricing-guide).

## Accreditation and information assurance

The security of our platform is our number one priority. We've always been committed to adhering to exacting standards, frameworks and best practice. Everything we do is subject to regular independent validation by government accreditors, sector auditors, and management system assessors.

We understand that enterprise workloads need a dependable service that underpins the reliability of the application to users and other systems, which is why we offer one of the best SLAs on G-Cloud. As the SLA varies based on the chosen cloud technology, you can find full details on each service's SLA, including measurements and service credits, in the [*SLA definition*](../other/other-ref-sla-definition.md).

## Why UKCloud?

UKCloud is dedicated to the digital transformation of our nation's public services through our flexible, secure and cost-effective multi-cloud platform and the expertise of our people and partners.
