## What is XQ Cyber CyberScore from UKCloud?

CyberScore is a fully automated, rapid, scalable, cyber security testing and rating service. CyberScore helps organisations of all sizes improve their cybersecurity by scanning their network, highlighting vulnerabilities and providing advice on how to harden their IT infrastructure. It is a fully automated service which enables organisations to dramatically reduce penetration testing costs.

CyberScore provides a fair, balanced and standardised assessment of your estate through automated scanning of devices within your network. CyberScore’s Get Well Plans and automated Technical Reports (pen tests) explain how to raise your security posture to a Pass level and where to focus security remediation efforts.

CyberScore provides an affordable path to Cyber Essentials Plus Certification. From registration to generating your certificate, the machine-based approach dramatically reduces your assessment costs and improves your true security in one process.
