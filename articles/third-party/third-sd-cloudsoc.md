# Security Operations Service Service Definition

## What is the Security Operations Service?

The Security Operations Service is a cloud-hosted cyber security solution that can see your organisation's entire IT estate, all the time, enabling complete visibility helping to identify suspicious activity, ensuring you have an up-to-date view of possible threats. Unlike other traditional cyber monitoring systems, the Security Operations Service combines people, process and technology to protect brand and reputation.

There's a growing demand for an end-to-end cyber security solution, given the need to keep pace with the rising expectations for online services such as always-on, hyper connected and secure applications. To meet this expectation, organisations are investing in distributed IT estates underpinned by cloud services, but this increases the potential attack surface and data sprawl across the estate. Whilst this delivers modern applications, it does present a cyber security challenge given this model exposes organisations beyond the traditional data centre, taking them into multi-cloud, hybrid cloud and on-premise deployments.

Utilising e2e-assure's capability performing services such as traffic analysis; deep packet inspections; Intrusion Detection Systems, vulnerability scanning; blacklist monitoring of the assets that matter to you; highly skilled Security Operations Centre (SOC) personnel and UKCloud's highly connected, highly secure cloud platform, we deliver a SOC that can see your entire IT estate and is always available.

## What the service can help you achieve
