## What is Portworx Enterprise from UKCloud?

The service provides a secure and stable cloud native storage and data management platform for Kubernetes that enterprises can trust to manage data in containers.

Kubernetes is the fastest growing open-source project in history, but Kubernetes was not designed with stateful applications like databases in mind. For enterprise applications, these systems have non-negotiable business requirements like high availability, data security, disaster recovery, strict performance SLAs and hybrid/multi-cloud operations. Portworx Enterprise addresses all these requirements enabling the adoption of Kubernetes for mission critical enterprise and traditional/legacy applications.

For full information regarding this product, we have Service Scopes, FAQs and other relevant documents on our [Knowledge Centre](https://docs.ukcloud.com).
