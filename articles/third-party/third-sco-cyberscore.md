# XQ Cyber CyberScore from UKCloud Service Scope

<sup>*</sup> All links to CyberScore support documents will require you to log in.

## About this document

This document describes the boundaries of the XQ Cyber CyberScore&trade; from UKCloud (CyberScore) service, along with the division of responsibilities between UKCloud, XQ Cyber and the customer, to facilitate the provisioning and ongoing use of the service.

## About CyberScore

CyberScore is a fully automated, rapid, and scalable cyber security testing and rating service that enables you to discover your cyber security *score* and generate high quality reports that help communicate and remediate vulnerabilities around the organisation and throughout the supply chain. The service provides a score based on the state of the vulnerabilities within your network, identifies key remediations and ranks and rates vulnerabilities so that you can decide on an acceptable level of cyber risk.

## CyberScore features

CyberScore provides the following key features:

- Scans network-connected devices from within your network to discover security vulnerabilities. Example devices are virtual machines, servers, desktops, IP phones, laptops and printers.

- Scans from outside your organisation to discover externally exploitable vulnerabilities. Example publicly-facing devices are firewalls and public IP addresses.

- Initiates scans manually or set to run automatically on a schedule.

- Produces a *CyberScore* from the data acquired during a scan. A CyberScore represents a vulnerability score between 0-10 for internal networks, and A-F for internet-facing systems. This score then acts as guidance for how vulnerable your network is, considering various factors such as the number, severity and nature of vulnerabilities found.

- Produces detailed technical reports from the scanning data. The detailed technical reports are akin to penetration test reports, with detailed descriptions of the vulnerabilities found. You can view an [example technical report](https://ukcloud.com/our-products/cyberscore/) on the UKCloud website.

- Supports the generation of *Get Well plans* based off the scan results. These reports summarise the action needed to improve your CyberScore, and are perfect as a summary to send to senior management or board level. You can view an [example Get Well plan](https://ukcloud.com/our-products/cyberscore/) on the UKCloud website.

- Summarises how your CyberScore has changed over time.

- Shows how you compare to the average CyberScore.

- Gives you an advisory recommendation  as to whether you would pass the Cyber Essentials Plus certification.

## Service and support

- **Customer Success Manager (CSM)**. For the first 90 days of the service, you have access to a UKCloud CSM, who will help you with your adoption of CyberScore.

- **Technical Account Managers (TAM)**.  You'll be allocated with an assigned point of contact who will provide ongoing assistance with reporting and incident escalation.

- **Support**. After the initial on-boarding, you can utilise the standard UKCloud support entitlement, which is documented in the [Customer Engagement Factsheet](https://ukcloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ukcloud-factsheet-customer-care.pdf). UKCloud can help with remediation of the service.

- XQ Cyber have created help notes, set-up guides and support pages within the [CyberScore web interface](https://xqcyber.com/cyberscore)<sup>*</sup>.

## Customer responsibilities

Your responsibilities depend on the nature of your engagement with UKCloud.

### You're a UKCloud IaaS customer

Installation and configuration of the CyberScore virtual appliance requires IaaS platform administrative permissions; therefore, the CyberScore installation must be done by you. However, UKCloud can assist with the set up. See [*XQ Cyber CyberScore scanner deployment environment requirements*](third-ref-cyberscore-prereqs.md) or contact your CSM or TAM to arrange help.

Scanning is free, however youâ€™ll need to purchase credits to analyse the scan and to generate the technical reports and Get Well plans. You can purchase credits through UKCloud and these will appear on your UKCloud monthly invoice.

### Your platform is managed by UKCloud

If your platform is managed by UKCloud then we can set up and manage the CyberScore appliance for you as part of the management agreement.

### You're using CyberScore as part of a UKCloud Professional Services engagement

CyberScore will be set up as part of the engagement by UKCloud, however as administrative permissions are required to install and configure the appliance, see [*XQ Cyber CyberScore scanner deployment environment requirements*](third-ref-cyberscore-prereqs.md) to ensure that the engagement is as effective and time efficient as possible.

## Remediation of security vulnerabilities

CyberScore does not action any changes to remediate the vulnerabilities it identifies. If you require help with cyber security we [offer Professional Services](https://ukcloud.com/professional-services/) to assist you.
