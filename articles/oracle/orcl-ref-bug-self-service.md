# Oracle cloud self-service functionality (bug notification)

## Overview

Due to a bug that has been identified within the Oracle cloud placement engine, until further notice, customers on the Oracle cloud will be unable to perform the following tasks through the Oracle cloud portal:

- Create new VMs

- Modify the compute and storage resources available to existing VMs

Until this issue is resolved, we ask that customers raise a Service Request so that UKCloud can provision Oracle VMs and VM resources on your behalf.

> [!NOTE]
> All other features within the Oracle portal will continue to function as normal. However, if you do experience any issues, raise a support request so that we can investigate.

We apologise for the inconvenience caused; we are working towards a solution as quickly as we can.

In the meantime, this means information in the following articles relating to VM creation and modification should not be followed, and a Service Request should be raised instead:

- [*How to build an Oracle virtual machine*](orcl-how-build-vm.md)

- [*Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for Oracle Software*](orcl-gs.md)

## Raising a Service Request

### New VMs

When raising a Service Request for new Oracle VMs, we require the following information:

- Customer environment

- UKCloud template (if required)

- CPU

- RAM

- OS (if required)

- Storage disks required (T1/T2 and sizes)

## Additional resources on existing VMs

When raising a Service Request for additional resources on existing Oracle VMs, we require the following information:

- Customer environment

- VM name

- Resource change required (CPU, RAM, disk)
