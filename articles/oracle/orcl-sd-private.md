# Private Cloud for Oracle Software Service Definition

## What is Private Cloud for Oracle Software?

Private Cloud for Oracle Software enables you to have private implementations of Oracle's Engineered Systems within UKCloud's assured, sovereign data centres, Crown Hosting Data Centres or even on-premises. It enables you to have a tailored Oracle environment specifically for the high performance or big data analytical platforms that are proprietary to Oracle, while connecting to workloads that you have within the rest of our multi-cloud ecosystem.

## What the service can help you achieve

- Retain your investment in Oracle licensing

- Use specialised Oracle hardware such as Oracle Exadata to boost performance of mission-critical applications

- Condense your infrastructure footprint by hosting existing Oracle Engineered Systems within UKCloud and moving other workloads into the multi-cloud platform

- Improve data locality by having your Oracle systems right next to your other workloads in the cloud

- Leverage Oracle PaaS (for example, Fusion Applications and Enterprise Database) to develop new applications in a safe and secure environment

## Product options

The service is designed to be flexible and enables you to mix and match from a range of pre-defined options for each virtual machine and change them when required.

## An SLA you can trust

We understand that enterprise workloads need a dependable service that underpins the reliability of the application to users and other systems, which is why we offer one of the best SLAs on G-Cloud.

If you exit the service within the minimum commit then UKCloud will bill all the remaining committed term's fees and asset costs within the final invoice.
