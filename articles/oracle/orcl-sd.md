## What is UKCloud for Oracle Software?

UKCloud for Oracle provides a proven Oracle Infrastructure as a Service that's tailor made for running your Oracle workloads in the cloud. This service enables you to move technologies such as Oracle Database, Oracle WebLogic Server, Oracle Fusion Applications, E-Business Suite and more to our secure sovereign cloud platform quickly and easily whilst enjoying the economies of scale of the cloud. You can then connect your Oracle applications to the non-Oracle workloads that you have within the rest of the multi-cloud ecosystem. It is billed hourly with no minimum contracts and supported free of charge.

For full information regarding this product, we have [Service Scopes](orcl-sco.md), [FAQs](orcl-faq.md) and other relevant documents on our [Knowledge Centre](https://docs.ukcloud.com).

## What the service can help you achieve

- Overcome licencing barriers of putting Oracle software in the cloud using Oracle hypervisor technology

- Remove reliance on on-premise Oracle infrastructure by running Oracle workloads within the cloud

- Streamline Oracle licencing by adjusting VM resources to suit performance and only licence the x86 or SPARC CPU cores used

- Improve data locality by having your Oracle workloads next to your other cloud workloads

- Ensure business continuity by using UKCloud for Oracle Software as part of your disaster recovery strategy

## Product options

The service is designed to be flexible and allows you to mix and match from a range of pre-defined options for each virtual machine and change them when required.

### Security domain

Choose the security domain in which you want to run your workload

- Assured OFFICIAL - DDoS-protected internet, PSN, HSCN and Janet

- Elevated OFFICIAL - PSN and RLI

- Above OFFICIAL - SLI and Crypto

### Public or Private

- Public - Share the multi tenant cloud as trusted users of UKCloud for Oracle Software

- Private - See the [*Private Cloud for Oracle Software Service Definition*](../private-cloud/prc-sd-orcl.md) for more information

- Dedicated - Private compute nodes on the public UKCloud for Oracle Software

### Oracle CPU type

Define the chipset needed to power your workload

- x86

- SPARC

### VM resource

Define the OVM resources needed to power your workload

- Number of Cores - Increments of 1 core

- Amount of Memory - Increments of 1 GiB

### Storage

Define the storage required to deliver your application. All storage is persistent and resilient to local hardware failures. Workloads can use multiple storage profiles

- Tier 1 - High I/O storage

- Tier 2 - General purpose storage

### Local protection

Choose the local protection required for your application in the event of a local host failure. This option is configured within each Oracle VM config menu. This is for x86 options only.

- Non HA OVM - UKC will manually migrate OVM to new host within same UKC Oracle region (You will need to restart the the OVM)

- HA OVM - OVM will automatically be migrated to new host within same UKC Oracle region (Restart of OVM is automated but not guaranteed)

### Backup & remote protection

UKCloud for Oracle Softwatre doesn't include infrastructure level backup and restore or remote protection products. Instead we offer an underpinning infrastructure that can support technologies that are compatible with Oracle VMs such as Oracle Data Guard and Oracle RMAN data protection solutions

- Multi Cloud Backup Storage - Compatible with Oracle RMAN and other DDBoost aware backup applicatons. See the [*Multi-Cloud Backup Storage Service Definition*](../mcbs/mcbs-sd.md) for more info

- Second Oracle region - Use Oracle Data Guard or other Oracle compatible replication technologies to create a DR environment in a second Oracle region

## Pricing and packaging

UKCloud for Oracle Software VMs start at 9p per hour, and full pricing with all options including licensing and connectivity available in the [*UKCloud Pricing Guide*](https://ukcloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ukcloud-pricing-guide-11.0.pdf).

## An SLA you can trust

We understand that enterprise workloads need a dependable service that underpins the reliability of the application to users and other systems, which is why we offer one of the best SLAs on G-Cloud. For full details on the service SLA including measurements and service credits, please view the [*SLA defintion article*](../other/other-ref-sla-definition.md) on the UKCloud Knowledge Centre.

**Measurement of SLA**       | The service is deemed unavailable if a customer is unable to restart a VM after it becomes unresponsive due to a fault recognised as the IaaS layer or below, that is, the fault is within UKCloud-controlled components, such as the physical infrastructure availability, storage, power and internal networking, such as physical firewalls and routers.<br>Oracle workloads are pinned to processor cores and will power off in the event of a host failure. Migrations are not live and VM restart will be required. UKCloud will advise customers if VM restart is required.<br><b>HA-enabled x86 VMs</b> will be automatically moved to a new host in the event of a host failure, but may require restarting. Automatic movement of VMs is covered by the HA x86 SLA. Customers are responsible for enabling the HA feature on x86 VMs and for restarting VMs.<br><b>Non-HA x86 VMs</b> require UKCloud to move Oracle VMs to a new host so they can be restarted. UKCloud's manual movement of VMs is covered by the Non-HA x86 SLA. Customers are responsible for restarting VMs<br><b>SPARC VMs</b> require UKCloud to move Oracle VMs to a new host so they can be restarted.
