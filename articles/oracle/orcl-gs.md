# Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for Oracle Software

## Overview

UKCloud for Oracle Software provides Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), powered by Oracle VM (OVM) technology, that is fully compliant with the compatibility and licensing requirements of Oracle-based enterprise applications.

This Getting Started Guide provides an overview of the functionality available with UKCloud for Oracle Software.

### Intended audience

This guide is intended for customers who want to get up and running with UKCloud for Oracle Software.

## Introduction to UKCloud for Oracle Software

Many applications running in the UK public sector today have a backbone powered by Oracle software. They include ERP solutions, finance systems (such as payroll), HR systems and wide variety of citizen‑supporting applications.

Oracle solutions have traditionally been subject to licensing and technical requirements that have made it challenging to carry out cloud transition projects and meet the government's Cloud First policy.

UKCloud for Oracle Software enables you to start your cloud journey with your Oracle applications. It overcomes the licensing and technical barriers, and provides the trusted, connected and flexible Assured OFFICIAL and non-internet-connected Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platforms you need to deliver your critical Oracle applications in the cloud. UKCloud for Oracle Software can help you achieve the business goals at the centre of your strategy, without risking your operational ability to execute.

The service has been designed and tested for compatibility with the most popular Oracle applications used in citizen‑facing solutions today, including:

- Oracle database (including features such as encryption and Data Guard)

- Oracle WebLogic Server

- Oracle Fusion Applications

- Oracle Enterprise Manager

- Oracle E-Business Suite

UKCloud for Oracle Software provides workloads with an uncontended infrastructure optimised for the performance and availability of Oracle workloads. You can right‑size the allocated resources to suit the changing demands of your application; ensuring performance and avoiding over‑capacity. You can specify the resource allocation of each workload independently: simply choose the appropriate CPU cores, amount of memory and required storage from the catalogue.

The service offers the following technical benefits specific to Oracle workloads:

- Use of core-pinning technology means that Oracle workloads operating on the UKCloud platform aren't subject to the types of movement that can unbalance Oracle applications running on other cloud platforms

- The scalable nature of our service enables you to add or remove cores in line with your understanding of the performance requirements of your solution

- Self-service management of your environment via our Customer Portal, which you can also use to programmatically control your Oracle environment

- Virtual firewalls to manage connectivity into and out of your environment -- self-service and free of charge

- IPsec and SSL VPN/SDN to create secure connections between users and other environments using a variety of included tunnelling technologies

- Basic load balancing to configure active/active solutions that are resilient to outages and can handle high levels of activity, using our on‑platform, out‑of‑the‑box load balancers

- Persistent storage so that your data remains, even when a virtual machine (VM) is turned off, ensuring that your application data remains consistent and available

### Oracle licensing compliance

UKCloud for Oracle Software does not include Oracle licensing but, because the platform is powered by OVM technology, you can be assured that it is compliant with Oracle's licensing requirements and you can bring your own Oracle licensing to build your solutions.

UKCloud ensures that hard partitioning is in place in all customer guest VMs in order to conform to Oracle licensing policies. When you create or modify a VM, automatic CPU pinning ensures that the VM won't use any CPUs other than the ones specifically pinned to the VM's vCPUs.

If you have any questions about Oracle licensing, contact your Cloud Architect, Customer Success Manager or Technical Account Manager.

If you require assistance building out your Oracle solution, we can put you in contact with one or our partners who specialises in Oracle technologies.

### Your UKCloud for Oracle Software estate

The management of your Oracle estate is split between Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) and vCloud Director:

- Use OEM to build and manage your VMs and templates

- Use vCloud Director to create your VM networks and configure your edge gateway, including firewall rules and VPN connections

![UKCloud for Oracle Software architecture](images/orcl-architecture.png)

When you first purchase UKCloud for Oracle Software, your Customer Success Manager (CSM) creates an Oracle tenant to act as a top‑level container for your Oracle VMs. As your estate grows, you can add more tenants to logically organise your resources.

Within your Oracle tenant you can create the VMs that comprise your Oracle applications.

## Building virtual machines

Your Oracle applications will consist of one or more VMs. In the Cloud Console, you create a VM by requesting a server. You can base your VMs on assemblies or templates.

On the *Infrastructure -- Oracle VM Cloud Services* page you can view and manage all your Oracle VMs.

**More information!** [*How to build an Oracle virtual machine*](orcl-how-build-vm.md)

## Setting up your network

Before you can start using the VMs in your Oracle environment, you need to create the network that connects the VMs to each other, and potentially also to the outside world. This network enables your VMs to communicate with each other or access external networks. A single Oracle tenant can have multiple networks. When UKCloud sets up a new Oracle tenant for you, we'll usually create an edge gateway for that tenant, but the creation of any networks is your responsibility.

Networking and connectivity for UKCloud for Oracle Software is managed within vCloud Director, which you access through the UKCloud Portal rather than Enterprise Manager Cloud Control.

> [!NOTE]
> Because you create your network in vCloud Director, you'll see references to VMware terminology, such as organisations and virtual data centres (VDCs). In UKCloud for Oracle Software, an Oracle tenant is equivalent to a VDC.

There are two types of network:

- An isolated (internally connected) network provides access only to the VMs within the Oracle tenant (see [*How to create an isolated VDC network*](../vmware/vmw-how-create-isolated-network.md)).

- A routed (externally connected) network provides access to machines and networks outside the Oracle tenant via the edge gateway. You can have up to nine usable routed networks per tenant: one for each connectivity type (see [*How to create a routed VDC network*](../vmware/vmw-how-create-routed-network.md)).

## Configuring your edge gateway

An edge gateway controls how traffic from the outside world comes into and out of your environment. It is very important to make sure that your edge gateway is configured correctly to make your applications available but also secure.

The tools for configuring your edge gateway are provided within vCloud Director, which you access through the UKCloud Portal rather than Enterprise Manager Cloud Control.

Your edge gateway provides the following services:

- **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)** --- The edge gateway can act as a DHCP server for VMs connected to VDC networks connected to an edge (see [*How to create a DHCP pool*](../vmware/vmw-how-create-dhcp-pool.md)).

- **Network address translation (NAT)** --- NAT rules determine where to direct inbound and outbound traffic (see [*How to create NAT rules*](../vmware/vmw-how-create-nat-rules.md)).

- **Firewall** --- The firewall controls which networks and ports can communicate through the edge gateway (see [*How to create firewall rules*](../vmware/vmw-how-create-firewall-rules.md)).

- **Static routing** --- Provides static routes from the edge gateway to other networks, for example, networks in other VDCs in your compute service (see [*How to create a static route*](../vmware/vmw-how-create-static-route.md)).

- **VPN** --- IPsec site-to-site VPN is available on the edge gateway (see [*How to configure IPsec VPN*](../vmware/vmw-how-configure-ipsec-vpn.md)).

- **Load balancing** --- The edge gateway provides simple HTTP and HTTPS load balancing using round robin (see [*How to configure a load balancer*](../vmware/vmw-how-configure-load-balancer.md)).

## Logging out of the Cloud Control console

When you're done working in the Cloud Control console, we recommend that you log out to prevent unauthorised access.

To log out of the Cloud Control console, click your user name and select **Log Out**.
