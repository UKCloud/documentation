# Private Cloud FAQs

## Service

### What is the service?

Private Cloud is a single-tenant UKCloud for VMware service, where your compute or storage requirements are hosted either in one of our data centres, to gain the benefits of our Assured and Elevated cloud platforms; or in your Crown Hosting Data Centre (CHDC); powered by VMware vCloud Director or OpenStack.

### How does Private Cloud Compute differ from UKCloud for VMware?

Private Cloud Compute provides you with dedicated infrastructure - the compute infrastructure is designed for the exclusive use of each customer, and provides the highest levels of separation and isolation from other customers.

This service differs from UKCloud for VMware in that it also allows you to have more flexibility in the size of your VMs.

### What backup/disaster recovery options do I get?

You can choose between two protection levels:

- Automated VM backup - providing protection in one data centre

- Site replication and failover - providing remote protection in a second data centre

### Where will my data be physically stored?

Your data will be stored in our highly resilient, UK-sovereign tier 3 data centres, which are separated by over 100km.

### How much data can I store?

A core benefit of Private Cloud is that it can scale to meet the most demanding compute requirements.

## Management

### How do I access my environment?

You can access your VMs using:

- The remote console through the UKCloud Portal

- Remote access protocols (such as RDP/SSH) over a VPN or secure network

Documentation on ways to interact with the platform is available from the UKCloud Knowledge Centre.

## Support

### How do I raise a support ticket?

UKCloud's secure online Portal provides the most common service management functionality. Alternatively, you can contact support by phone or email.

### How do I manage my services?

Private Cloud on the Assured OFFICIAL (formerly IL2) domain can be managed over the internet via the UKCloud Portal.

For the Elevated OFFICIAL (formerly IL3) domain, the security requirements are much stricter and require either a PSN-approved connection, UKCloud Secure Remote Access, or CAPS-approved encryption.

### What are your service maintenance windows?

As far as possible, planned maintenance of UKCloud's infrastructure takes place between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Sunday, or between the hours of 08:00 and 12:00 (UK local time) on a Saturday or Sunday. We provide customers with at least 14 days' advance notice of planned maintenance.

As far as possible, emergency maintenance of UKCloud's infrastructure takes place between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Sunday, or between the hours of 08:00 and 12:00 (UK local time) on Saturday or Sunday, unless there is an identified and demonstrable immediate risk to a customer's environment. Whenever possible, we provide customers with at least six hours' advance notice of emergency maintenance.

## Onboarding

### How can I get started with the service?

On acceptance of your order, we'll work with you to create a detailed design for your Private Cloud service. The design will formalise the dedicated components required for your solution.

If this is a new service for you, we will create your primary administrator account and send you a welcome pack, which includes the URL for the UKCloud Portal for access to the Knowledge Centre and service management function.

## Billing and legal

### What is the smallest unit of time I will be billed for?

Billing depends on the packaging option chosen - the smallest option for this service is monthly.

Please note, this service is offered under a 24-month minimum term commitment.

### How can I pay for the services?

Service charges are billed monthly in arrears. In addition, there will be initial upfront charges, which vary depending on the pricing model selected.

Payment can be made by direct bank transfer (BACS/CHAPS).

### How can I view billing information?

Billing information is available via the UKCloud Portal.

### What are the termination fees?

An early exit charge will be payable if the contract is terminated before the end of its original term. Customers are responsible for extracting their data from the platform if required.

UKCloud may make an additional charge for transferring data out of the service.

### Is there a free trial?

Owing to the dedicated, single-tenant nature of this service, no trials are available.

## Security

### What data is suitable for our cloud?

The service is hosted in the UK and operated by SC-cleared staff. It has extensive independent validation (including CESG design reviews) that it is fully aligned with NCSC Cloud Security Principles, and is therefore ideal for all data classified at OFFICIAL (including OFFICIAL SENSITIVE).

### Can systems on different UKCloud platforms communicate with one another?

UKCloud's Cross Domain Security Zone allows customers to use the customer-designed and managed Walled Garden, to enable communication between platforms.

For more information, see the [*Cross Domain Security Zone Service Definition*](https://docs.ukcloud.com/articles/cdsz/cdsz-sd.html).
