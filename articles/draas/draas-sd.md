# Disaster Recovery as a Service Service Definition

## What is Disaster Recovery as a Service?

Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS) protects your critical applications in the event of disaster or ransomware attacks. This service negates the need for your organisation to manage additional data centre infrastructure to provide workload resilience in the event of disaster. DRaaS makes it easy to replicate and recover virtual machines (VMs) to the cloud, by failing over from your own data centre to UKCloud's trusted, cost-effective and well-connected VMware cloud. This service supports and facilitates your own business continuity (BC) plan or disaster recovery (DR) processes. You can easily replicate data and VMs from your primary site to UKCloud to recover your services with minimum downtime and data loss. In contrast to traditional DR techniques, UKCloud's service enables you to undertake regular, real-world, non-disruptive tests.

## What the service can help you achieve

- Protect your on-premises workloads to UKCloud secure data centres

- Create a duplicate copy of your server estate that is always in sync should a DR event occur

- Comply with policy, regulation or legislation (for example, Civil Contingencies Act) without the cost, complexity and inefficiency of traditional DR solutions

- Reduce your data centre footprint and associated CAPEX by removing the legacy infrastructure required to provide a DR solution

- Minimise data loss and downtime by realising short Recovery Point and Recovery Time Objectives (RPO and RTO)

- Lower your carbon footprint with an efficient platform

- Simplify DR testing â€“ simple non-disruptive testing to ensure you can meet your business continuity requirements

- Replicate your on-premises network topology in the cloud using software-defined network capabilities

## Product options

This service is designed to be flexible and enables you to choose the level of protection you require for your specific workload. The protection period is the time frame that journals are stored for, and therefore defines the maximum recovery point available. You can select either 2, 7, 14 or 28-day protection.

## Pricing and packaging

Disaster Recovery as a Service pricing can be as low as 2.5p per hour. Full pricing with all options is available in the [UKCloud Pricing Guide](https://ukcloud.com/pricing-guide).

## Accreditation and information assurance

The security of our platform is our number one priority. We've always been committed to adhering to exacting standards, frameworks and best practice. Everything we do is subject to regular independent validation by government accreditors, sector auditors and management system assessors. Details are available on the [UKCloud website](https://ukcloud.com/governance/).

## Connectivity options

UKCloud provides one of the best-connected cloud platforms for the UK public sector. We enable access to our secure platform by DDoS-protected internet, PSN, Janet, HSCN, MCN and your own leased lines via our HybridConnect or CrownConnect services. The full range of flexible connectivity options is detailed in the [UKCloud Pricing Guide](https://ukcloud.com/pricing-guide).

## An SLA you can trust

Due to the service being dependent on connectivity between the customer data centre and UKCloud, we are unable to offer an SLA relating to the performance of this service.

For full details on the service SLA for our UKCloud for VMware service, including measurements and service credits, see the [*SLA definition*](../other/other-ref-sla-definition.md).
